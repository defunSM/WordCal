Alkalinity 




Objective: 
        To determine the alkalinity of the unknown sample using titration to determine the concentration of OH and CO3^2-.


Procedure:


Part 1: Preparation of Na2CO3 Solution


        Use a clean dry weight boat to weigh boat to mass about 1.0 g of Na2CO3. Next transfer the contents of the weigh boat into a clean 250 mL volumetric flask rinsing any residual powder out of the weigh boat into the flask with a disposable plastic pipet full of distilled water.


        Add about 50mL of distilled water to the 250 mL volumetric flask and swirl to dissolve. Add about 50 mL more of distilled water and swirl; continue until all of the sodium carbonate has dissolved. Than fill to the line with distilled water, cap with parafilm and mix well. Parafilm will wrap around the opening of the volumetric flask just like Saran wrap. 


        You will need to calculate the molarity and include the calculation in your lab report.


Part 2: Standardization of H2SO4 Solution


        Obtain about 50 mL of the .05 M sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4) from the designated supply. Pour about 5 mL into your buret swirl it around and pour it down the sink drain and repeat. This is conditioning your buret so that any liquid inside is now your solution and not water or something else. Put your buret into the buret clamp and using your buret funnel, fill the buret to about the 0 mL line, making sure that the tip is filled and has no bubbles.


        Using a 10.0 mL volumetric pipet , transfer two 10.0 mL portions of your Standard Sodium Carbonate solution into a 250 mL erlenmeyer flask (for a total of 20 mL added). Using a graduated cylinder add about 20 mL of distilled water. Then add 3-4 drops of phenolphthalein and swirl.


        Record the Exact initial buret reading (estimate the second decimal place. Titrate with a piece of white paper under your flask so that you can see the color change easier and have a flask of distilled water nearby so that you can compare your endpoint color to it.


        Quickly add about half your estimated amount and constantly swirling the flask to ensure mixing. Slow down and continue titrating until the pink color starts to disappear than go drop by drop until the color has completely dropped. Once your solution has turned clear and colorless. Record the final reading from the buret in your lab notebook. The difference between the final initial readings is the volume of acid for EP1.


        The color of  your solution might have changed back to pink and if it doesn't it's okay. Continue until it turns color. The end point is when all the blue green color is gone. Record the final reading from the buret.
        
        Empty the contents of your flask down the sink and repeat steps 1-7 for two more samples of your standard sodium carbonate solution.


        Calculate the molarity of your sulfuric acid solution using all six endpoint volumes.


        Calculate the average molarity and standard deviation or average deviation include in a report.


Part 3: TitratIon of an unknown and a natural water sample 


        Use the same setup as in part 2 transfer 20 mL of unknown solution to each of three 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask using the 10.0 Ml volumetric pipet and pipet pump. Add about 20 mL of distilled water to each using a graduated cylinder and then 3-4 drops of phenolphthalein. Fill the buret with your sulfuric acid solution and record the initial reading in your lab notebook.


        Refill the buret with your sulfuric acid solution and record the initial volume
To the same flask from step 1 add 3-4 drops of mixed indicator.


        After you have completed the first trial you can titrate the next two much more quickly because of the approximate volume of acid needed.


        Repeat the same procedure as above but this time using 20 mL of the provided natural water sample instead of the Na2CO3 solution. Titrate the provided natural water sample in triplicate as well. Using Table 1 You should be able to identify the components of your unknown and of your natural water sample. Then using Table 2 and Equation calculate the five different alkalinities for each.


Part 4: Potentiometric Titration of Unknown the pH 


Calibrate the pH meter as you were taught in previous experiments. 


Transfer 20 mL of your unknown to a 100 mL or 250 mL beaker. Add enough distilled water to cover the tip of the electrode. Fill the buret with the sulfuric acid solution and record the initial reading in your lab notebook. Slowly turn on the magnetic stirrer making sure that the stirring rod is not hitting the electrode.


Add H2SO4 in 1.0 mL increments recording the pH at each step until you are 1.5 mL away from your first endpoint. At this point you want to make smaller additions and record the pH more frequently. Add .5 mL of the H2SO4 at the time and record the pH after each addition until you are 1.5 mL beyond your first endpoint. Repeat this same procedure for the second end point.


Clean up your workspace and return all materials.


Construct a graph with pH (y axis) and mL sulfuric acid (X-axis). On the same graph you plot on the y axis against mL sulfuric acid on the x axis. The peaks in the pH mL curve help to pinpoint where the largest changes in slope occur and these indicate where EP1 and EP2 volumes are

Conclusions and Results:


The purpose or goal of this experiment was to find the alkalinity of the unknown solution through titration. This was done by creating a standardized H2SO4 solution for the unknown solution to be dipped into.
        
        The technique for this experiment was very successful. Our data collected from the experiment and our initial expectations matched up and overall had no difficulty performing the experiment.


        We determined that it took 16 mL to reach to first endpoint and then an additional 5 mL to reach the second endpoint.  This was expected since  the first endpoint takes a larger amount of volume to reach than the second endpoint. This matched our expectations with the observations that were observed in the experiment.


        In the experiment we had to prepare a Na2CO3 solution in order for the creation of the standardization of a H2SO4 solution. The Na2CO3 would than be used to create the H2SO4 which would help determine the alkalinity of the unknown solution through titration. 


        In part 3 we titrated an unknown sample and natural water and was able to find the endpoints of each titration through adding sulfuric acid until the color disappears. We than added mixed indicators and depending on the color would add H2SO4 and if the color disappears that would be the second endpoint for the titration. The component of the base in this situation would be the OH- while the acid is H2SO4. 


        Total Alkalinity = A = EP1 + EP2 = AxMx(5.00 x 10^3)


        Total Alkalinity = 25485


        Phenolphthalein Alkalinity = A = EP1 =  15.8*.597*5*10^3


        Phenolphthalein Alkalinity = 47163


        Carbonate alkalinity = 2*EP2*15.8*.597*5*10^3


        Carbonate Alkalinity = 26865


        Bicarbonate Alkalinity = 0


        Hydroxide Alkalinity = 2*EP2 = 2* 4.5*.597*5*10^3


        Hydroxide Alkalinity = 11.3


In part 4 we are able to determine the endpoint of the titration because of doing the titration from part 3 we have an estimate of the amount of acid needed. Therefore we just add smaller increments of H2SO4 till we are 1.5 mL away from the first end point and than we add smaller amounts of H2SO4. We calculate the values in the same way and calculating the -pH/mL is just subtracting the two pH and dividing it by the change in mL. There is differences but it is expected since it is observed that the potentiometric titration of the unknown sample regarded less volume of H2SO4 to reach the endpoint.


According to the standard deviation that was calculated our data is relatively good. As far as sources of errors go there are not much sources of errors besides some random error sources such as liquid being stuck to the beakers which may cause different amounts of volumes affecting possibly the pH. 


One way to prevent more errors is to more accurately perhaps measure and stir automatically or use beakers that won't have the liquids sticking to the sides of the beaker which would affect the overall pH since the liquid isn’t actually part of the solution.
        
        One of the most important things that I have learned from this experiment is that I learned how to find the alkalinity of a solution through a two point end point titration. This is extremely useful to know how to do since it can serve  a wide variety of purposes such as finding the amount of solution to add to disinfect a populated source of solution. Also I learned that through adding the unknown source the pH of the solution dramatically goes down at a certain point.
        


        


Question #1:


The reason that the HCO3- and OH- ions were omitted from the possible combination of ions that could be identified is because HCO3- is an acid and OH- is a base. This means that it would be an acid base reaction creating salt and water. Since ACID + BASE --> SALT + WATER which is why the combination of HCO3- and OH- is omitted in this situation.


Question #2:


To find the amount of H2SO4 needed we use the calculated molarity of Na2CO3 which is 0.039 M
After that we do the following…


        0.0250 L STD x 0.039 M = 0.000975 moles of CO3^2-
        
        0.000975 moles of CO3^2-/2= 0.0004875 moles of H2SO4


        0.0004875 moles of H2SO4/0.05 moles H2SO4 = 0.00975 mL of H2SO4 (9.75mL)


                          


Question #3:
        
About 15.8 mL of sulfuric acid solution should be needed to reach the second endpoint.
