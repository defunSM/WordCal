FOREWORD

For twenty years, you’ve been reading and listening to us talk about Vampire: The Masquerade.
This time, we thought it was the community’s turn to talk. We approached a number of rabid Vampire fans
from all over the world (some of which have since come to work for us), and asked them to tell us how this
game touched their lives.
This, then, is the real story of Vampire: The Masquerade.
My passion for vampires and roleplaying personal
horror stories collided when I was given [the] 2nd
Edition Vampire: The Masquerade for my 16th
birthday.
Vampire: The Masquerade managed to enhance
my imagination far beyond any other RPG: I got so
involved that I led the largest Spanish WoD online community, where creativity and dreams were
shared by hundreds of people.
In my opinion and experience, Vampire: The
Masquerade has made history in vampire mythology, but more importantly, it has been a great source
for inspiration, friendships, feelings, and love.
Lorenzo Melchor (London, UK)
Make no mistake, the book you hold in your
hands is a beast, at once beguiling and delightfully
dangerous. It will seduce you into a life of dreaming as it did to me twenty years ago. I owe Vampire: The Masquerade, and its creators, much of
my livelihood. I know that reads a tad gauche, but
it’s true. White Wolf’s storytelling game of blooddrinking immortals inspired me to build for its
players a community and produce a successful trading card game. Vampire has left an indelible mark
on my creative work and given me a career in the
game industry, for which I am eternally grateful.
Matthew Burke
Founder, Camarilla Fan Club
My first contact with Vampire was five years ago
and it was one [of] the first RPG[s] I played. The
group ended up being cancelled but later on I was
invited by a friend to play in a Vampire LARP
game. That was three years ago and today I can
say that some of my closest friends are because of
this game. It’s a hobby that never gets old and the
reason why I have met many wonderful people all
over the world and shared awesome time[s], laughter and good moments with them.
Maja Zaccara (San Paulo, Brazil)
Assistant Head Coordinator, One World by Night

In 1993, I stood in front of the White Wolf booth
at GenCon as Enzo Giovanni trying to get, by hook
or by crook, as much Pentex stock as possible — all
in the hope of landing my first hobby game gig writing for my favorite intellectual property. Eighteen
years and one design career later, Vampire is still
the absolute standard of what’s exciting and cool
in gaming. Without Vampire, tens of thousands of
gamers would have never learned that there is a
far greater world to imagine than that of hack and
slash.
Shawn “Enzo” Carnes
Executive Director of Janitorial, Pentex Corporation
1992: I wear social stigma like a crown of shit.
“Masquerade,” the green marble book whispers. I
embrace the Eldritch leather chrysalis. Suddenly
sex, drugs and rock’n roleplaying is more than just
a play on words. I breathe free.
1995: The Umeå bomb-squad descends on Elysium, robotic camera spots Anarch firebomb. Moral panic ensues. They call us “The Army of The
Abandoned” and I see how powerful we are. “This
game will change the world!”
2011: Looking in the mirror, I understand. The
Masquerade didn’t change the world. It changed us.
Martin Elricsson (Stockholm, Sweden)
Vampires. Always in the collective imagination
as charismatic and seductive people… and so it
was. When I discovered Vampire: The Masquerade it stunned me: so rich of shades, poetry, adventure, intrigues. It was as a treasure to discover.
And it made me feel as a child, it made me meet a
lot of people playing together, year by year. Grouping friends around a table, rolling [dice], acting as
[vampire] Actors in a LARP: well... it’s really wonderful! It brought me a lot of new friends. Did it
change my life? Yes, sure! [I’m] positive.
Caterina “Lara” Casapieri (Milan, Italy)
National Coordinator, Camarilla Italia

In 1995, I’d fallen in with some friends I’d met
over a local BBS, who were big D&D players. They
introduced me to Vampire: The Masquerade,
which blew my mind. I realized everything had
changed when I got pissed off after my character
had gotten diablerized by another player’s character. This was a new medium for telling stories.
Everything snowballed from there. I’m now forced
[to] realize that I’ve been playing these games for
more than half my life. I wouldn’t be who I am
now without them. I am honored and excited to
help celebrate this 20th anniversary with so many
other fans.
Ian A. A. Watson
Webmaster, Wolf-Spoor.org Fan Site
Back in the 90s, my little cousin invited me to
watch Kindred: The Embraced at my uncle’s. Little
did I know how much Vampire: The Masquerade
would positively influence my life.
I joined a WoD online community, which I
helped to develop and turn into the biggest one
in Spanish. Amongst other things, I improved my
organizational, leadership, and mediation skills,
quite impressive for a mild Asperger like me.
More importantly, I have met those who are
nowadays my best friends. I have met the love of
my life. The 20th Anniversary is a life celebration
for every fan.
Dhaunae De Vir (London, UK)
I realized I was gay in high school, but felt isolated
and afraid to tell my conservative father. Vampire
provided escape into a world that understood the
stress I felt, pretending to be something I wasn’t. (I
joked that I lived Homosexual: The Masquerade.)
Eventually, I came out to my dad and, eventually,
he accepted me.
Vampire taught me ambition and courage. As an
adult, I’ve achieved my dream of becoming a game
designer and I’m out in the industry. The world is
growing more accepting, but I hope this new edition will find those who still need to masquerade.

Vampire: the Masquerade has turned out to be
a factor in some of my life-determining points over
the last 20 years. From meeting my first long-term
girlfriend at a Camarilla session to picking up my
love for DJing again because of a Camarilla benefit
(and eventually turning DJing into my full-time
profession), lots of good memories are attached to
V:tM. I can’t begin to list the number of life-long
friends I made through the game, how it taught me
RPGs could be about more than a dungeon bash,
and of course, the hours and hours of fun I had with
it.
David “DJ Hive” Benoy (Belgium)
VampireParty.com
Vampire: the Masquerade has given me the possibility to meet people from all over the world who
love to embrace their childhood with a grown up
version of “[playing h]ouse.” It has been a wonderful experience filled with fun and good times, both
in character and out of character as we trek across
the country, exploring archeological sites through
a darker story.
Talia Hanselman (Israel)
Admissions Coordinator, One World by Night
When I was first asked to write a blurb about
how Vampire: The Masquerade changed my life
my initial thought was “How am I supposed to sum
up my whole life in 100 words”. From The Eternal
Struggle to The Masquerade, Laws of the Night
and Mind’s Eye Theatre, this world has been an integral part of my life since the mid-nineties. What
started as a game around a table quickly became a
hobby, a lifestyle and culminated in a career and a
move from Sweden to the US where I met my wife
and formed a family. The first 20 years of Vampire
has given me the best and most defining moments
of my life, and I hope that over the next 20 years I
can be part of creating equally amazing experiences
for you all.

FOREWORD

I became a gamer instead of being a “gamer’s
girlfriend” because of Vampire. In 1996, I watched
a Camarilla LARP in Austin, TX and bought my
first RPG book the next day. Friends I made that
night are part of my life today and I have met other people around the world because of this game.
Most importantly, nine years later, I was invited to
join the company, then was given the opportunity
to be a White Wolf writer. That night, this game,
changed the course of my life. For that, I will always be grateful.
Kelley Barnes
Camarilla Club Director (2005-2010)
Freelance Writer
Vampire: the Masquerade has played a big part
in my life throughout the years. In 1991 it captured my imagination when I was in high school.
In 1995, while I was in college, I played in and
ran some of the greatest Vampire games. In 1999 I
met the woman who would become my wife when
she joined a Vampire game I was running. In 2003
I joined the online White Wolf community and it
wasn’t long before word spread that I could make
custom character sheets. Vampire has and will always be a great influence in my life.
Chris “Mr. Gone” Leland (Seymour, Indiana)
[…] 20 years later, Vampire is still relevant to
us. It isn’t often that a game of pretend creates the
opportunity to forge lifelong commitments, but
I look at Vampire and see that’s exactly what it
did. The fact that our group of fans continues to
grow and expand shows that the respite we craved
20 years ago is still needed, still valuable, today.
So thank you, Vampire, for all the memories, the
opportunities, the laughs and tears. Thank you
White Wolf, for giving us another opportunity to
revisit it, in such an amazing format. Happy 20th
Birthday Vampire.
Ric Connely
Chairman of the USA Board of Directors, 		
The Camarilla Fan Club

I first discovered Vampire: The Masquerade in
college and have not looked back, except in fond
memory of all of the friends I have made and the
places I have traveled through what went from a
counterculture to a culture all of its own. As the
20th Anniversary approaches, it hardly feels like
that long for those of us who are still a part of this
world we have grown up with, shared with friends,
and developed into something deserving of such
jubilant celebration. I know I speak for not just
myself, but all of the friends I have made when I
give a sincere thanks to everyone out there who
made all of this possible and that we look forward
to 20 more years in this endless night.
Robert Crosby
Head Coordinator, One World by Night
I started playing Vampire in 1993 and was
amazed! The freedom of character and story really
appealed to me. There is great potential in creating
a world that challenges, not only the characters,
but the players. Instead of the characters being secondary to the story, the story is a direct result of
the players’ actions. I take great pride in turning
perceived realities on their head so that the players never really know what’s next. The greatest reward is when the players finish a story and look like
they just walked through a hurricane and they say
“WOW!”
David Martin
Alpha, The Wrecking Crew
This book has taken me into some weird, beautiful places since I picked it up twenty years ago. Not
only that, but it changed my mundane reality into
a playfield of dark imagination. It taught me how
by our creative will alone we shape the world. It
was, and still remains, the philosopher’s stone for
an urban alchemist. No other game has had such
a lasting impact on my life, friendships and professional career.

CREDITS AND CONTENTS

To

M

W.H.,

from your most devoted servant:

any years have passed and I fervently hope that time will have
dulled somewhat the distressing memories you carry. I dare to send
you this in a spirit of supplication; while your forgiveness is too much
to ask, I crave at least your understanding. I owe you some kind of
explanation for the events which so shattered your blameless life.

A

lthough I exhibited precious little Menschwert before you and
your companions, the flame of Humanitas still burns in my breast,
albeit erratically. Time and nature both struggle to extinguish it, thus
completing my descent into the Inferno of madness and bestiality. I
must guard my soul well – as well as any priest – for any lapse in
vigilance lets in the Beast, with results which you yourself have seen.

I

know it is impossible to atone; an eternity of pious prayer is too
short a time. However, as a mark of penitence, I offer you the enclosed document, the act of which makes me a traitor to my own kind.
I pray you may find something in its pages to help you understand
the torment I inflicted upon you, and by understanding, perhaps, dispel some little amount of the pain. The tone, I fear, is somewhat dry;
a soldier has little need for pleasing tricks of poesy to beguile a reader.
I have merely set down that which I know, as well as I may.

I

owe you a debt which can never be discharged. If at any time I
may be of service to you or your family, I am at your command.

V.T.

Semper Servus,

INTRODUCTION

BOOK ONE:
THE RIDDLE
I cried tears of love as I,
with sharp things,
sacrificed that which was the first part of my joy,
my brother.
And the Blood of Abel covered the altar
and smelled sweet as it burned.
But my Father said,
“Cursed are you, Caine,
who killed your brother.
As I was cast out so shall you be.”

INTRODUCTION

Introduction
“No one holds command over me. No man. No god. No Prince. What is a claim of age
for ones who are immortal? What is a claim of power for ones who deny death? Call your
damnable hunt. We shall see who I drag screaming to hell with me.”
- Günter Dörn, Das Ungeheuer Darin
Let’s face it: If you’re reading this book, you almost
certainly have a history with Vampire, and with White
Wolf’s Storyteller games in general. We’re not going to
spend word count on “What is roleplaying?” or other
elementary principles of the hobby — this is stuff you
already know, and if you don’t, there are tons of websites where you can get that information. Instead, we’re
going to spend more space in Vampire: The Masquerade – 20th Anniversary Edition on all of the stuff that’s
usable to you — all of the rules and setting that form
the core of the Vampire experience, plus expanded
Disciplines, scores of bloodlines (past and present),
tweaked rules based on feedback from the Vampire
community, and bits and pieces from here and there
that should prove useful. Sure, we’ll go over the central
concepts of Vampire, but after that, we’re going to be
in high gear.

What This Book Is
A Classic Experience: Call to mind the first time you
picked up Vampire, when you first became immersed
in the World of Darkness. A quick poll around the office showed that none of us could stop thinking about

the game, constantly connecting the dots between
real-world events and the intricate undead conspiracy.
This edition aims to tap into what made us fall in love
with Vampire in the first place. Whether your fondest
memories of the game are a day or a decade old, we
want to take you back to the time when the shadows
loomed long and the vast potential of the terrifying,
thrilling world of the Kindred first beckoned. We won’t
be chasing metaplot through a library of supplements
or advancing any storylines. We want the pure, undiluted essence of Vampire.
A Zeitgeist: Vampire exploded into hobby games in
1991, and it very much evinced the gothic and punk
subcultures from which it drew, with their own roots
from the late 1970s through the mid-1990s. Remember
the classic archetypes and breathe new life into them:
skinheads, goths, street preachers, metalheads, punks,
wild-eyed poets, gangsters, urban primitives, dapper
mods, eerie pagans, and every icon who made for a
memorable character in this snapshot of time.
A World of Darkness: Vampire evoked at once an
urban alienation and neo-mystic sense of belonging. It
was high society and the low life. It was angst and monstrosity and sketchy drugs and a dangerous flirtation

with a femme fatale who dragged you into a Damned
immortality of blasphemous power... and the urges of
the implacable Beast. Gargoyles and gothic architecture. Soaring skyscrapers and dilapidated tenements.
Cops and junkies. Corrupt senators and seductive bohemian artistes. Razorblades and torn fishnets. Leather
jackets, a broken rosary, and a stolen revolver with the
serial number filed off. Herein are the horrifying, Byzantine, lurid backdrops against which all of the dramas
of the Kindred play out, and we’re going to revel in
their decadent opulence and trenchant squalor.
A Thank You: This year is the 20th anniversary of
Vampire, and we certainly wouldn’t be here without
the loyalty and enthusiasm of the people who played
the game in its various incarnations throughout the
years. Metaphorically, this book is White Wolf at a bar
with the long-time players and we’re sharing a drink,
telling stories, and remembering why we became friends
in the first place. Tell us about your character.

Oh Yeah, The Metric System
The reality is that most of us who have
worked on Vampire are Americans, and we
write what we know. But we have a lot of very
passionate European fans. Time and again
through the process of writing Vampire: The
Masquerade – 20th Anniversary Edition, we
were asked “Can you please stop using your
stupid Imperial system and put everything
into metric?”
Well, we did both. Where there’s an Imperial measurement, we tried to put the metric
equivalent nearby, so it’s one less thing you
have to worry about when you’re in the
middle of diablerizing the Prince of Stockholm. But this isn’t a math class — rather
than have scores of “62.35 liter” comments
littering things up, we rounded them to the
nearest manageable number. The conversions
aren’t exact, and they aren’t meant to be; like
a lot of things in Storyteller games, the rules
are a little vague so there’s room for your story
at the table.

Live-Action
Although Vampire started off as a game that takes
place around a tabletop, over the past twenty years a
massive and thriving community of live-action roleplay (or “LARP”) has taken the game in whole new
directions. Many such troupes use our Mind’s Eye
Theatre rules for their games or a variation of these
tabletop rules, but there are plenty of others that use
custom rules while keeping the Vampire setting to
create their own modern gothic chronicles. There
are even organizations like The Camarilla and One
World By Night that connect troupes in different cities into massive chronicles covering the entire globe.
Other LARP games have come and gone, each with
their own communities, but the appeal of dressing up
as one of the Kindred and acting out the machinations
of the undead has been consistent throughout most of
Vampire’s history. In fact, if you’re reading this, odds
are good that even if you haven’t played in a Vampire LARP, you’ve likely heard of them. Why has the
appeal of dressing up and pretending to be a vampire
lasted so long?
Many other LARPs involving imagining a fantasy
world, a historical setting, or a place set in the far future. These games are fun in their own right, but they
require more costuming and props to communicate the
setting to everyone and get them on the same page.
Because World of Darkness games take place in our
modern world, today, there’s less of a leap needed to
get everyone imagining what’s going on. It also means
a lower barrier to entry. A fresh player can show up in
a T-shirt and jeans and play a young, rebellious Brujah without breaking the flow for the other players. He
can look up something on his phone or talk about recent news while remaining in character. It’s easier to
integrate our world into the World of Darkness, which
makes it easier to jump in and start playing.
On the other hand, dressing up in an elaborate costume is lots of fun, and vampires can do that just as
well. That Brujah in the T-shirt can argue politics with
a Ventrue in a frock coat, while they are overheard by a
Nosferatu dressed in an elaborate cloak and mask, and
it all makes sense. The clash of styles and history resonates with the ancient-but-modern culture of vampires
as a whole, instead of detracting from it. And the blend
doesn’t even have to be historical — vampires from
a wide variety of cultures and languages can plot and
scheme against each other with equal aplomb.

INTRODUCTION

Finally, the eternal political tension in Vampire
means that there’s always someone to piss off, and
there’s always someone else that can capitalize from
that. Many LARPs are either full-on open warfare between the players or completely team-oriented against
outside forces, but Vampire creates a constant churn
of loyalties, an ever-shifting web of intrigue and favor
that encourages conflict without constantly breaking
out into bloodshed. Tonight’s social outcast might be
tomorrow night’s Prince, which means that players always have someone new to talk to, and someone else
new to snub.

Safeguards
Despite the wide variety of live-action games out
there, there are some rules common between them to
ensure that live-action is safe and enjoyable for all participants and bystanders.
• No Touching: All combat and physical interaction is generally handled through the rules. Players
must never strike, grapple, or otherwise touch anyone
during the game — some games allow some consensual
touching in specific instances, but you can never go
wrong by not touching in the first place. It is the Storyteller’s responsibility to call a time-out if one or more
players get overly rambunctious.
• No Weapons: Props such as hats, period dress, and
canes are great in a live-action game. Weapons aren’t.
No knives, no swords, and nothing that even remotely
resembles a firearm should be carried – law enforcement generally doesn’t take “but we were playing a
game” as a good excuse. Even bringing fake swords,
squirt guns, or foam-rubber weapons can lead to confusion and panicked phone calls from outsiders. If your
character must carry a weapon, take an index card and
write “Gun” or “Sword” or whatever on it; during combat challenges, present the card to the Storyteller, who
will adjudicate its use in play.
• Play in a Designated Area: Live-action is meant
to be played in a home or other pre-designated spot.
Don’t involve bystanders in the game, and make sure
everyone in the area, or who passes through the area,

understands exactly what you’re doing. Even though
the concept of a live-action game is a lot more mainstream now than it was when Vampire started, a game
can look suspicious, disturbing, or even frightening to
those who aren’t aware of what’s going on. Always be
polite to people outside the game.
• Know When to Stop: If the Storyteller calls for
a time-out or other break in the action, stop immediately. The Storyteller is still the final arbiter of all
events in the game. Likewise, when the game is over
for the night, use it as a good opportunity to take out
your fangs and have dinner and drinks with the other
players to swap war stories (and maybe engage in a little braggadocio).
• It’s Only a Game: Live-action is for having fun. If
a rival wins, if a character dies, if a plan goes awry, it’s
not the end of the world. Sometimes folks like to get
together outside the game and talk about it, and there’s
nothing wrong with that. But calling your clanmate up
at four in the morning to ask for her assistance in your
Primogen bid is taking things too far. Remember, everyone’s doing this to have fun.
Live-action can be one of the richest and most satisfying storytelling experiences, if handled maturely and
responsibly. Many of us have been playing it for years,
and have made a lot of life-long friends through playing
undead bastards out to screw each other over. Here’s to
twenty more years of costumes, dental adhesive, and
political overthrows!

What is a Vampire?
In Vampire, players assume the personas of vampires
— the immortal bloodsuckers of the horror genre —
and guide these characters through a world virtually
identical to our own. But these aren’t quite the vampires you might know from Dracula or Twilight. The
vampires that exist now — or Kindred, or Cainites,
as they commonly call themselves — are both similar
to and different from what we might expect. In many
ways, vampires resemble the familiar monsters of myth,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

cinema, folklore, and fiction. However — as many an
intrepid vampire-hunter has learned to his sorrow —
not all of the stories about vampires are true.
• Vampires are immortal. True. While they can be
killed (a very difficult process), they do not age or die
from natural causes. They don’t need food such as humans eat, and they don’t need to breathe.
• Vampires are living dead and must sustain themselves with the blood of the living. True. A vampire
is clinically dead — its heart doesn’t beat, it doesn’t
breathe, its skin is cold, it doesn’t age — and yet it
thinks, and walks, and plans, and speaks… and hunts
and kills. To sustain its artificial immortality, the vampire must periodically consume blood, preferably human blood. Some penitent vampires eke out an existence from animal blood, and some ancient vampires
must hunt and kill others of their kind to nourish
themselves, but most vampires consume the blood of
humanity. Our blood.
Vampires drain their prey of blood through the use
of retractable fangs, which Cainites develop as soon as
they first become undead. Each vampire can also mystically lick closed the wounds made by their fangs, thus
concealing the evidence of their feeding.

Blood is all-important to the Kindred, for it is both
the crux of their existence and the seat of their power. Mortal food, mortal air, mortal love — all of these
things are meaningless to a vampire. Blood is the Kindred’s only passion, and without it, they will quickly
wither and fall dormant. Moreover, each vampire can
use its stolen blood to perform amazing feats of healing,
strength, and other supernatural abilities.
• Anyone who dies from a vampire’s bite rises to
become a vampire. False. If this were true, the world
would be overrun with vampires (and not just in our
media). Vampires do feed on human blood, and they
do sometimes kill their prey — but most humans who
die from a vampire’s attack simply perish. To return as
undead, the victim must be drained of blood and subsequently be fed a bit of the attacking vampire’s blood.
This process, called the Embrace, causes the mystical
transformation from human to undead.
• Vampires are monsters — demonic spirits embodied in corpses. False… and true. Vampires are not
demons per se, but a combination of tragic factors draws
them inexorably toward wicked deeds. In the beginning, the newly-created vampire thinks and acts much
as she did while living. She doesn’t immediately turn

INTRODUCTION

into an evil, sadistic monster. However, the vampire
soon discovers her overpowering hunger for blood, and
realizes that her existence depends on feeding on humanity. In many ways, the vampire’s mindset changes
— she adopts a set of attitudes less suited to a communal omnivore and more befitting a solitary predator.
At first reluctant to kill, the vampire is finally forced
into murder by circumstance or need — and killing becomes easier as the years pass. Realizing that she herself
is untrustworthy, she ceases to trust others. Realizing
that she is different, she walls herself away from the
mortal world. Realizing that her existence depends on
secrecy and control, she becomes a manipulator. And
things only degenerate as the years turn to decades and
then centuries, and the vampire kills over and over,
watching the people she loved age and die. Human life,
so short and cheap in comparison to hers, becomes of
less and less value, until the mortal “herd” around her
means no more to her than a swarm of annoying insects. Vampire elders are among the most jaded, unfeeling, and paranoid — in short, monstrous — beings the
world has ever known. Maybe they are not demons exactly — but at that point, who can tell the difference?
• Vampires are burned by sunlight. True. Vampires
must avoid the sun or die, though a few can bear sunlight’s touch for more than a very short period of time.
Vampires are nocturnal creatures, and most find it extremely difficult to remain awake during the day, even
within sheltered areas.
• Vampires are repulsed by garlic and running water. False. These are myths, and only a very small fraction of vampires are even inconvenienced by them.
• Vampires are repulsed by crosses and other holy
symbols. This is generally false. However, if the wielder
of the symbol has great faith in the power it represents,
a vampire may suffer ill effects from the brandishing of
the symbol.
• Vampires die from a stake through the heart.
False. However, a wooden stake — or arrow, crossbow
bolt, etc. — through the heart will paralyze the monster until it is removed.
• Vampires have the strength of 10 men; they can
command wolves and bats; they can hypnotize the
living and heal even the most grievous wounds. True
and false. The power of a vampire increases with age.
Young, newly created vampires are often just a little
more powerful than humans. But as a vampire grows in
age and understanding, she learns to use her blood to
evoke secret supernatural powers, which vampires call

Disciplines. Elders’ powers can often rival those of the
fictional Lestat or Dracula, and the true ancients —
the Methuselahs and Antediluvians who have stalked
the nights for thousands of years — often possess literally godlike power.
• Vampires have sex. True. It’s a great way to feed,
but carnal pleasures don’t mean as much to the Kindred. Feeding, which vampires call “the Kiss,” is an
incredibly intoxicating and erotic experience for Cainites and their victims. Sex is great, but nothing truly
replaces the ecstasy of feeding for a vampire.

The Embrace
Vampires are created through a process called the
Embrace. Some vampire Clans Embrace more casually
than others, but the Embrace is almost never given
lightly. After all, any new vampire is a potential competitor for food and power. A potential childe is often
stalked for weeks or even years by a watchful sire, who
greedily evaluates whether the mortal would indeed
make a good addition to the society of the Kindred.
The Embrace is similar to normal vampiric feeding as
the vampire drains her chosen prey of blood. However,
upon complete exsanguination, the vampire returns a
bit of her own immortal blood to the drained mortal.
Only a tiny bit — a drop or two — is necessary to turn
the mortal into a new vampire. This process can even
be performed on a dead human, provided the body is
still warm.
Once the blood is returned, the mortal “awakens” and
begins drinking of his own accord. But, though animate,
the mortal is still dead; his heart does not beat, nor does
he breathe. Over the next week or two, the mortal’s
body undergoes a series of subtle transformations; he
learns to use the Blood in his body, and he is taught the
special powers of his Clan. He is now a vampire.

The Hunt
When all is said and done, the most fundamental
difference between humans and vampires lies in their
methods of sustenance. Vampires may not subsist on
mortal food; instead, they must maintain their eternal
lives through the consumption of blood — fresh human blood.
Vampires acquire their sustenance in many fashions.
Some cultivate “herds” of willing mortals, who cherish the ecstasy of the vampire’s Kiss. Some creep into
houses by night, feeding from sleeping humans. Some
stalk the mortals’ playgrounds — the nightclubs, bars,
and theaters — enticing mortals into illicit liaisons

and disguising their predation as acts of passion. And
yet others take their nourishment in the most ancient
fashion — stalking, attacking, and incapacitating (or
even killing) mortals who wander too far into lonely
nocturnal alleys and empty lots.

The Nocturnal World of the Vampire
Vampires value power for its own sake and for the
security it brings, and they find it ridiculously easy to
acquire mundane goods, riches, and influence. A mesmerizing glance and a few words provide a cunning vampire with access to all the wealth, power, and servants
he could desire. Some powerful vampires are capable
of implanting posthypnotic suggestions or commands
in mortals’ minds, then causing the mortals to forget
the vampire’s presence. In this way, vampires can easily acquire legions of unwitting slaves. More than a few
“public servants” and corporate barons secretly answer
to vampire masters.
Though there are exceptions, vampires tend to remain close to the cities. The city provides countless
opportunities for predation, liaisons, and politicking —
and the wilderness often proves dangerous. The wilds
are the home of the Lupines, the werewolves, who are
the Kindred’s ancestral enemies and desire nothing
more than to destroy vampires outright.

The Jyhad
Some vampires seek to have nothing to do with their
kind, choosing instead to exist and hunt in solitude.
However, the civilization of the undead is a manipulative and poisonous dance, and few vampires are left
entirely untouched. Since the nights of antiquity,
Cainites have struggled for supremacy, in an ancient
and many-layered struggle known as the Jyhad. Leaders, cultures, nations, and armies have all been pawns
in the secret war, and vampiric conspiracies have influenced much (though by no means all) of human
history. Few things are as they seem in the vampires’
nocturnal world: A political coup, economic crash, or
social trend may be merely the surface manifestation
of a centuries-old struggle. Vampire elders command
from the shadows, manipulating mortals and other
vampires alike — and the elders are often manipulated
in turn. Indeed, most combatants may not even realize
for whom they fight, or why.
Reputedly begun millennia ago, the Jyhad rages even
today. Though skyscrapers take the place of castles,
machine-guns and missiles replace swords and torches,
and stock portfolios substitute for vaults of gold, the
game remains the same. Kindred battles Kindred, Clan

10

INTRODUCTION

battles Clan, Sect battles Sect, as they have for eons.
Vampiric feuds begun during the nights of Charlemagne play themselves out on the streets of New York
City; an insult whispered in the court of the Sun King
may find itself answered by a corporate takeover in Sao
Paolo. The ever-swelling cities provide countless opportunities for feeding, powermongering — and war.
Increasingly, vampires speak of Gehenna — the longprophesied night of apocalypse when the most ancient
vampires, the mythical Antediluvians, will rise from
their hidden lairs to devour all the younger vampires.
This Gehenna, so the Kindred say, will presage the end
of the world, as vampires and mortals alike are consumed
in an inexorable tide of blood. Some vampires strive to
prevent Gehenna, some fatalistically await it, and still
others consider it a myth. Those who believe in Gehenna, however, insist that the end time comes soon.

How to Use This Book
This book is divided into several chapters, each of
which is designed to explore and explain a specific area
of the game. Remember, though, that in a storytelling
game, the most important “chapter” is your imagination. Never let anything in this book be a substitute for
your own creativity.
Chapter One: A World of Darkness describes the
Kindred and the world in which they hunt.
Chapter Two: Sects and Clans describes the 13
great “Clans” of Kindred and the organizations to
which they hold allegiance.
Chapter Three: Character and Traits gives stepby-step instructions for creating vampire characters as
well as a description of the Traits that make them up.
Chapter Four: Disciplines delineates the wide variety of mystical powers of the undead.
Chapter Five: Rules provides the basic means of resolving the characters’ various actions.
Chapter Six: Systems and Drama describes a plethora of ways to simulate everything from gentle seduction to brutal combat.

Chapter Seven: Morality describes Humanity and
the various Paths of Enlightenment that more alien
and inhuman vampires adhere to.
Chapter Eight: Storytelling tells Storytellers how
to build entertaining stories in which to involve the
characters.
Chapter Nine: The Others gives notes on the Kindred’s (few) friends and (many) enemies.
Chapter Ten: Bloodlines details a wide range of minor bloodlines, Clan variations, and some of the strains
of vampire thought lost to the mists of time.
Finally, the Appendix provides addenda and miscellaneous rules.

Source Material
Vampire not only pays homage to a long-standing
and thriving genre, but has itself inspired countless
vampire novels and movies over the past two decades.
You can’t throw a rock and not hit a young adult series
or a television show featuring vampires, but below are
a few of the most important influences on the creation
of Vampire.
Inspirational literature is almost too daunting to consider. Some of the most cited inspirations: Dracula, by
Bram Stoker; Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire
Lestat, and The Queen of the Damned, by Anne Rice;
Lost Souls, by Poppy Z. Brite; Brian Lumley’s Necroscope
series; The Hunger, by Whitley Streiber; and I Am Legend, by Richard Matheson. The vampire plays a role in
the romantic poetry of Byron, Shelley, and Baudelaire,
and the Internet has thousands of sites of old myths
and legends of vampires from around the world.
There are also a ton of vampire movies as well. Bela
Lugosi’s Dracula and Murnau’s silent Nosferatu are
the granddaddies of the genre. Other good (or at least
amusing) films include The Hunger, Near Dark, Vamp,
The Lost Boys, Salem’s Lot, the Cristopher Lee Hammer
Horror films, and the anime flick Vampire Hunter D.
Coppola’s Dracula is not the best in terms of plot, but
does have lush cinematography. And for television,
you can’t go wrong with shows like Buffy the Vampire
Slayer, Angel, and True Blood.

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

Chapter One:
A World of
Darkness
“The Children of Seth will always hate us again and again, for we are their predators.
We are their Masters and they know this, deep in their soul.”
- The Book of Nod

The world of Vampire is a dark reflection of our own.
The shadows loom longer here, and the night is more
reluctant to yield to day. Corruption runs rampant,
from the government through private corporations and
into the various subcultures that revel in these culturally bankrupt times.
It is a world of contrasts, of haves versus have-nots. It
all looks very much like the real world, as seen through
an extremely stylized filter that turns up the contrasts
between dark and light. The technology is the same
as ours right now, but the people who use it are different — darker, in personality and motive — and that
changes how the world functions.
In this world, vampires exist, and they are very much
an extension of the tarnished aesthetic that shapes the
World of Darkness. Whatever their origins, or whatever they believe to be their origins, vampires are an
outgrowth of the people who populate this desperate
environment. Vampires exist in the World of Darkness
because they are the monsters among us, the products
of a world so dark that only something truly horrible
and captivating can challenge the depths into which
the living residents of the world have plunged it.

In this setting, you will tell tales of morality and depravity, of redemption and damnation. When you play
Vampire, you enter this World of Darkness. Will you
leave it a better place when your time is done? Or will
you take the path so many others have, leaving more
blight, ruin, and sorrow as your legacy?

Gothic-Punk
The Gothic aspect of the setting is very much in the
literary tradition of the word. Gothic literature paints
a world of anachronisms, barbarism, decay, madness,
and a romanticized history that never existed. In the
ultramodern context of Vampire, we see it in the
churches whose spires soar skyward, in the avarice and
treachery of the wealthy who enjoy great comfort, in
the crumbling architecture of the cities and the way
nature reclaims the places forgotten or abandoned by
men. A tenement erected at the turn of the 20th century, fronted by dingy, fluted columns and infested with
squatters, is a neo-gothic rookery. A merciless millionaire’s estate on the edge of town is a modern castle, as
is his lavish penthouse in the bustling district where

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

13

mortals go to dance and drug away their cares. A mad
priest offers succor to those members of his flock tormented by “monsters,” the ivy-choked cemetery where
velvet-clad sensualists recite poetry and seduce the
shades of the departed, the graffiti-tagged warehouse
docks where the skinheads torment their victims: All
of these and more are hallmarks of the modern gothic
experience.
Punk, on the other hand, refers to the context in
which people experience their world. It’s about anger, about getting in someone’s face and saying “No
more.” It’s about refusing to be ignored and stepping
on some motherfucker’s toes to get your point across.
As a result, conflict is everywhere, from the gang wars
that plague the streets to the self-serving movements
in the back rooms of governments and corporations. It

runs in scale from the clash of cultures where domains
overlap to the desperate, personal struggle of a mother
who can’t afford to feed her crying child or the struggle
between a junkie and his drug of choice. Rebellion is
everywhere, and just living another day to spit in the
face of what the long-shadowed World of Darkness has
to offer is an act of defiance. Everyone opposes something, and the punk element of the setting is the dramatic fulfillment of that opposition.
Ultimately, you will decide the details the GothicPunk ambience of your vampire stories. The setting
may pale in importance to the narrative events of your
chronicle, or the city and its components may become
like a character themselves. Whatever the case, your
vampires are a product of their environment, and every
scene you and your troupe describe reflects this.

Theme and Mood
Over the course of playing a Vampire chronicle, you will explore a wide variety of story situations, interesting characters, and challenges. In almost every case, these interactions will illustrate
the theme of the chronicle that the Storyteller wishes to convey, and will involve the mood of
impending reckoning. That generalization leaves room for creative interpretation, however, and
each of your stories will be the truly unique result of theme, mood, and storytelling.

Themes
Some themes are inherently part of the Vampire experience, and the Storyteller will either expand on those or introduce his own into the mix. Here are the core themes of the game, to better
illustrate the setting.
A Beast I Am, Lest a Beast I Become: Vampire lets you play the monster and makes you morally accountable for it. All of the protagonists are vampires: blood-drinking monsters who dwell
in the shadows at the edge of society and subculture. Vampires have tremendous power, but that
power comes paired with the Curse of Caine, which carries a Biblical gravity. Players have an emotional stake in these characters, and when we play the game, we see their dark side and watch them
wrestle with morality. This timeless riddle implies that all vampires must fall eventually, but when
and under what circumstances? These questions are at the root of the chronicles that we play.
The Masquerade: It’s the very foundation of Vampire. Once the character is Embraced, they
are drawn behind the curtain, and everything they know is changed. The Kindred try to keep the
curtain closed, convincing their prey that monsters do not, in fact, hide among them. Inevitably,
cracks appear in the façade and the Damned are revealed for who they are. What happens when
this occurs? For more information about the Masquerade as a concept, see p. 22.
The Sins of the Father: People rarely choose to become vampires. In most cases, a sire Embraces
them without much regard for whether or not the individual wants to commit to an unlife of predation, scheming, and horror. Likewise, the childe acquires the sire’s Clan, and thus his powers,
weaknesses, and often predilections. This is all a great allegory for the Biblical idea of Original
Sin, and deeply tied to the prevailing religious origin than many vampires attribute to the state
of vampirism. God cursed Caine for murdering Abel and, as descendants of that first vampire, all

14

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

Kindred bear the stain of that primeval sin. This accountability, decided for each Cainite by the
actions of her sire, pervades the vampire condition.
A War of Ages: Elder Kindred hate younger vampires because they fear new generations will
take away the domains they’ve fought for decades or even centuries to establish. Younger Kindred
resent their elders for the ways they selfishly lord over their domains and refuse to allow the young
to make a place for themselves. It’s like waiting for a promotion that will never come because the
person in the position above you is never going to die or retire — and you need your job to stay
alive. Kindred history is characterized by the haves versus the have-nots, most often in the form
of the elders versus the neonates. The Anarch Revolt and the subsequent Inquisition were the
apex of this struggle in history, but it plays out every night on more localized scales of Kindred
community and influences the way all vampires interact in the World of Darkness.
Inherent Conflict: Sect versus Sect. Clan versus Clan. Rebels versus the status quo. The Man
versus the Beast. Everybody’s against everybody in the World of Darkness, and there’s never
enough to go around. These conflicts color the other themes of the game, and what your sire has
made you — in terms of Kindred, Clan, Sect, and outlook — automatically buys you a panoply
of enemies.
Conspiracy: Wheels turn within wheels. The Kindred as a race are skilled manipulators and
deceivers, the better to enact their schemes while maintaining a veneer of deniability. A neonate
striking out against a hated elder might actually do so at the behest of that elder’s rival, who incited the turbulent vampire with a clever ruse. Indeed, some Kindred wonder if the whole of the
Jyhad is the machination of the Antediluvians, and whether any vampire truly has free will.
Apocalypse: These are the End Times. The judgment of the Kindred, Gehenna, is coming. We
don’t know when, we don’t know how, and we don’t even know what it’ll be, but all of the grim
portents of our kind indicate that we’re careening toward our reckoning. Do we rage against the
dying of the light, or do we fiddle while our contemporary Gothic-Punk Rome burns? Are all these
elders really so vituperative over petty politics with the Biblical Rapture at the threshold? What
will happen to the mortal world when the Kindred judgment is nigh?

Mood
Vampire stories can be complex and subtle tapestries that can evoke a variety of moods in individual chronicles. There are some, though, that are common to the World of Darkness.
Sensual: It might be a pang of desire, or it might be an undeniable physical lust, but becoming a
vampire is a sexual consummation, as is the act of feeding. We’re dead, sexy things and we’ll never
grow old, and we have a license from our maker to indulge our every erotic urge.
Mysterious: Fog and shadows shroud the landscape. This is the mood of Casablanca and The
Maltese Falcon, of Hitchcock and J. J. Abrams. The imagination is aroused by the things that
remain nebulous and hidden, and even the vampires that stalk the night don’t know everything
that happens in the shadows.
Dangerous: Nonstop action, full of intensity. The World of Darkness is a dangerous place, and
death is always just around the corner. Just when you catch your breath, two guys kick in the door
with guns in their hands. The life of the vampire is filled with drama and suspense.
Eerie: There is an oppressive weight in the air, a sense of great evil that hangs over everything.
Everything has a strange, unreal quality to it. The World of Darkness is full of the bizarre, and the
vampires are not the only monsters around.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

that vampire just performed the Embrace, well, there’s
no longer only one vampire there.

The Kindred
For the Kindred, cities are urban collections of territories and domains that stand as illuminated points
against the greater backdrop of the wilderness and the
places in between their safety. For vampires, the paradigm is almost medieval. The cities are their homes, and
everything that’s not a city represents some sort of danger. Outside the city are packs of savage Lupines, vast
fallow areas where there is no blood to be found, and
the unquantifiable strangenesses endemic to a World
of Darkness. Modern technology eases those dangers
somewhat, but most Kindred are effectively trapped in
cities, where they gild their cages with elaborate games
of prestige, social status, and vendetta.
To that end, much of Vampire takes place in urban
environments. Why should the Kindred risk starvation
in the untamed wild when those badlands confer no
status upon their masters, and when a frenzied werewolf may well come rampaging across the landscape,
leaving dismemberment in his wake? Truly, vampires
are uniquely acclimated to city domains, and the cities
are the places that hold the most of their most precious
resource in vitae.

The Embrace
Upon the Embrace, the fledgling’s senses sharpen,
displaying to her a richness of visual colors, auditory
distinction, tactile fineness, and olfactory alertness
that mortals senses are too limited to discern. The most
important of all, however is taste — taste becomes the
new Kindred’s primary sense, and with it she engages
the pursuit of a single taste to the exclusion of all others: vitae. Mortal blood. The mortal dies, and in her
places rises a member of the undead, a Kindred. With
this unholy rebirth comes a host of new potential, from
the mystical powers known as Disciplines that Kindred
possess to the quintessential vampiric ability to use
blood for a variety of supernal purposes.
Thereafter, nothing is the same for the fledgling. She’s
no longer mortal, but a new member of an elaborate society of the Damned, who have their own complicated
codes of behavior, their own customs, and seemingly
endless rules and protocols that dictate who is subservient to whom and under what circumstances. Even for
those who rebel against the system — Anarchs, ungovernable Autarkis, and any number of other rogues — a
pecking order must exist. The only place it doesn’t is
when only one vampire claims the domain… and if

16

The trappings of the fledgling’s mortal life can no
longer support her. In the short term, the new vampire
now requires blood to sustain herself, and surrounding
oneself with vessels of sustenance whom one loves will
inevitably result in bloody ruin. In the long term, while
the new vampire will remain deathless, unchanged by
time, those around her will age, wither, and die. The
easiest course, most sires agree, is simply to turn one’s
back on the mortal life that no longer offers anything
but tragedy and a reminder of the damned state of the
undead.

A Beautiful Corpse
Once a vampire is Embraced, her looks are frozen in
time. Her skin will be unnaturally cold to the touch
and become paler as she ages, but she will look the
same in a thousand years as she does on the night of
her Embrace. However, her body does not work like it
used to. As mentioned previously, nearly all Kindred
are unable to eat food after the Embrace, vomiting it
up almost immediately — only blood will sustain them.
Over time, most of the vampire’s bodily fluids will be
replaced by blood — the Kindred sweats a thin sheen
of blood when nervous, cries tears of blood when sad,
and makes a god-awful mess during sex.
Blood has other, unique uses for vampires. Besides
needing it for sustenance, Cainites can mentally direct
the blood to various parts of her body, “spending” it to
perform a variety of feats. She can heal herself, mending scrapes, cuts, and slashes in moments. She can
also enhance her physical capabilities, making herself
stronger, hardier, or more agile for a short period of
time, and fuel the mystical powers at her command.
Her blood can also create new vampires through the
Embrace, and enslave the minds of mortals and even
other Kindred. Some vampires can also spend blood
to appear human once again: make their skin rosy and
warm, mimic breathing, and even allow her to have
sex once again (although intercourse pales in comparison to the ecstasy of the Kiss).

The Beast
Of course, there’s a downside as well. Inside every
vampire lurks an impassioned, hungry creature that is
the opposite of the Man. It is the Beast, and the Beast
knows only three activities: kill, feast, sleep. It is the
roiling, inchoate desire every Kindred feels to slay her
prey rather than taking just enough. It is the inevitable urge to be what the vampire is — a predator who

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

doesn’t answer to the will of men or hide from their
numbers. When the Beast takes control over a vampire, she is said to enter a state of frenzy, directing the
Cainite into a response of fight or flight.
But the Beast isn’t a simple animal soul; it can be
sophisticated. It knows that the war against the Man
is one that, given time, it will inevitably win. Thus,
in young vampires, the Beast is often a savvy creature,
willing to take small victories here and there because
in the long term, they lead the Kindred down the path
of greater degradation and subservience to the Beast.
Tonight the Kindred destroys property, tomorrow she
kills with reticence, the night after that she kills with
relish. By the time the Man has eroded and the Beast
holds sway, there is little rational consciousness left to
the Cainite in question. Kill, feast, sleep is all that remains in a vampire dominated entirely by her Beast.

The Aristocracy of the Dead
The Kindred who believes he’ll forever be the toughest motherfucker in the place just because he drinks
blood and can’t die is in for a rude awakening. Thousands upon thousands of other vampires are competing with him for that top-dog status. Vampires are

powerful creatures, certainly, but those powerful creatures have put in place hierarchies of their own, and
none of them have “share my jealously hoarded power
with some newly Embraced whelp” at the top of their
agendas.
The elders have it all sewn up, it would seem. They
claim domains that they have held for decades, if not
centuries. The social hierarchies, no matter the Sect, are
occupied by cagey vampires who didn’t rise to the top by
being companionable. The highest echelon of Kindred
authority in almost any city is a spider’s web of tenured
intrigues, vicious rivalries, and outright hatreds that can
boil over into physical violence and even Final Death.
Add to this the fact that these entrenched elders are
masters of manipulation and misdirection, and many
young vampires feel — not incorrectly — that they are
pawns. They are moved in a game played by hoary old
monsters, and their every movement may not even be
their own. Does the brash young Brujah really hate the
Toreador ancilla who snubbed her at a party? Or did
the Ventrue elder encourage his great-grandchilde to
hustle the inexperienced Brujah sire into introducing
his progeny too soon into Kindred society in the hopes
that the Toreador would make a move? These are the

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

17

games the elder Kindred play with one another. These
are the wheels within wheels in the spiteful war of ages
known as the Jyhad.

The Jyhad
What sets vampires at each other’s throats? What motivates them to construct the elaborate social systems
that allow them to stubbornly maintain their veneer of
humanity? What is the origin of the endless games of
brinksmanship in which vampires contest one another?
In a single word, it is the Jyhad.
Vampires are inherently solitary creatures, lone predators whose urges are selfish and destructive. When
one vampire meets another for the first time, neither
of them can ignore the fact that the other is a rival for
the limited resources that he exerts himself night after
night to cultivate. Whether an individual is a mighty
Sabbat Bishop or a lone Gangrel who subsists by not
being noticed, each Kindred on a primal level knows
that for every new vampire spawned, unlife becomes
more and more difficult, more and more dangerous.
In these modern nights of sophisticated Sects, longstanding Clan politics, and the histories of cities that
define the fates of the Kindred who dwell there, this
primitive urge to hoard all available blood all for
oneself finds outlet in conspiracy and gamesmanship.
What one Kindred wants, another hoards, another has
plans to steal, and still another can distract them all
and seize a momentary advantage.
It is ironic that Cainites turn to a mortal political
figure to summarize the perilous philosophies of the
Jyhad, and, indeed, if Kindred interactions can be described in terms of human perspective, the appropriate
word is Machiavellian. “A prince never lacks legitimate
reasons to break his promise,” Machiavelli advises, and
“If an injury has to be done to a [rival] it should be so
severe that his vengeance need not be feared.”
Such perspectives are the bylaws of the Kindred’s
eternal war against one another, and with centuries or
millennia behind the individual feuds in the Jyhad, it
is no wonder that the Damned play their cards so close
to their chest. These are no mere territory struggles
among short-lived mortal tyrants. These are the conflicts that drive history.

The Modern Advantage
Although it may seem like the elders have all of the
best domains, young Kindred do have a certain advan-

18

tage. They haven’t been dead as long as their elders,
and remain closer to the mortals from whom they only
recently parted.
This means they still have a connection to mortal
trends, and in nights when even children have technology at their disposal, young Kindred do, too. Elders’
age and stasis make them reluctant to engage with
these new — and, frankly, frightening — technologies. Thus, the speed at which information travels is
the neonate’s most valuable asset.
From social media to web-based archives of city history to data clouds that house all of the public records
of civic transactions (including the name on the deed
of the Tremere chantry…), the ability to seemingly
reach into the ether and pluck out vital information is
an aptitude that confounds many elders. Consider that
a given elder may have once held sway over scriptoria
of monks who diligently copied manuscripts by hand
over the span of years, or even one who watched the
printing press slowly transform the western world. The
speed at which information disseminates is a modern
horror that can cause even the most stalwart elder to
blanch. Flash mob at the graveyard, which just happens to be a craggy old Malkavian’s favored haven?
“No problem,” says the confident young vampire,
smartphone in hand. There has even been talk of vampires making their own social network.
Just know what you’re getting yourselves into,
whelps.

Social Distinctions
Various castes, appellations, and divisions distinguish
the Kindred. Most vampires belong to more than one of
the following groups, and movement between them can
be as liquid as a neonate’s ambition or as calcified as an
elder’s habits. It all depends upon the domain and the
circumstances. Note that these are allegiances or classifications, not jobs. Titles and offices a Kindred may
possess are something altogether different (see p. 24).

Age
One of the ways that Kindred determine the social
pecking order is through a combination of age and
Generation (an indication of how far the vampire is
removed from Caine, the original vampire). NewlyEmbraced Cainites must prove themselves to older,
more established vampires in order to gain any sort of

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

recognition or standing. There is a small degree of mobility, but a vampire primarily gains respect through
the passage of time and the attrition of his enemies.
Fledgling: A fledgling is a newly-Embraced vampire
who has not yet been introduced to Kindred society
and formally emancipated from her sire. To this end, a
sire is responsible for the actions of his childe until he
deems her able enough to handle Cainite culture on
her own. Some Clans shelter their fledglings for years
or decades, like the Tremere, while others, like many
Gangrel and Brujah, figure that once you’re a vampire,
you’re on your own — tough shit if you can’t hack it.
The Sabbat — who sometimes call their hastily-Embraced fledglings “shovelheads” due to their bizarre
Embrace rituals — are usually much more pragmatic: If
the fledgling survives and does something worthwhile,
she’s not a shovelhead anymore.
Neonate: A neonate is a young vampire, one who
has not been Kindred very long. The main difference
between a neonate and a fledgling is that the neonate
has been emancipated from her sire and otherwise is
seen as an “adult” in vampire society. The line between
fledgling and neonate is incredibly subjective, but usually once Kindred society stops thinking of a vampire
as her sire’s appendage and more on her own merits
and actions, then she’s become a neonate.
Ancilla: Those Kindred who have a few decades or
centuries under their belts generally fall into the loose,
subjective category known as the ancillae. They have
paid their dues, understand (mostly) how Kindred society works, and have probably accomplished something.
Ancilla is the rank between neonate and elder, implying some degree of achievement in what local Kindred
society deems appropriate. Of course, what counts as
“achievement” can vary wildly from Sect to Sect. A
Camarilla ancilla would be considered soft and effete
by the Sabbat, while a Sabbat ancilla would probably
be described as a raging maniac by Camarilla standards.
Elder: What constitutes an “elder” is similarly subjective, but it generally corresponds to a rough age
distinction of anywhere from 200 to 1000 years of being Kindred, with appreciable claims to domain and
a variety of other assets to bring to bear in the Jyhad.
Typically, elders of Europe are much older than those
across the Atlantic Ocean. Elders are typically the oldest active vampires in undead society.
Methuselah: When a vampire reaches a particular
age, somewhere between 1000 and 2000 years of undeath, a profound change invariably overtakes him. It

has long been debated whether this change is mystical
or biological. Regardless, by the time a vampire reaches
this age, the weight of millennia sets in, as well as an
increased paranoia. Those who are weak or take risks
do not survive to this age — only the most indomitable
attain the station of Methuselah.
As a means of self-preservation, Methuselahs retreat from the world. The constant struggle of facing
the young who seek power through the blood of their
elders grows numbing. Eventually one of the hungry
whelps will get lucky. Thus the only option is to retreat
fully from society, and go into torpor. Some Methuselahs remain involved in power struggles and the Jyhad
of the Kindred, but do so from a position of complete
anonymity. Still others do so from the cold sleep of
torpor, moving their minions with mental commands,
dream-visions, or centuries of conditioning. The fear
of Jyhad, that no Kindred may truly call his actions his
own, stems from the inexorable dread spawned by the
terrible potential of the Methuselahs.
Antediluvian: Literally “before the flood,” the Antediluvians are believed to be those vampires of the
Third Generation (see p. 29) who are descended from
Caine’s original childer. Rumored to be the last vampires “with mastery over life and death,” the Antediluvians are almost certainly in the grip of millennial
torpor, assuming they still exist at all. If these Biblical
monsters still dwell on earth, they cannot possibly still
resemble humans in anything more than physical form.
They have been vampires for so long that their urges
and desires are wholly alien to human sensibilities,
and even to those vampires who have been Kindred
for “only” a thousand years or fewer. Some Kindred
philosophies prophesy that the Antediluvians will rise
from their unquiet slumber and devour their wayward
childer during an apocalypse known as Gehenna. Radical — perhaps suicidal — believers in this prophecy
advocate destroying the sleeping monsters where they
lie, if they can be discovered and destroyed at all.

Clans and Sects
A Kindred’s Clan is her lineage, the vampiric “family” into which she was Embraced. The Clans are distinguished by their Antediluvian founders. Kindred society generally acknowledges 13 Clans tonight, though
some may have been lost to history, some may exist in
secrecy, and some may never have been known. Some
Clans are highly organized, while others are utterly decentralized. The only constant when speaking of Clans
is that each has a unique ultimate progenitor, a set of

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

19

mystical aptitudes known as Disciplines, and a pervasive flaw.
Those without a Clan are known as Caitiff. These
individuals are undeniably vampires, but they display
no inherited characteristics from their sires (if, indeed,
they know who their sires are at all). Caitiff are frequently shunned in Kindred society, as much for their
lack of pedigree as their ignorance of vampiric social
structures.
A Sect is an artificial organization of vampires, usually composed of multiple Clans that form a league or
compact. In most cases, one’s Clan has immense influence on one’s Sect, but exceptions do occur. Some
Clans belong to no Sect at all, and in most cases, Caitiff may be found among any of the Sects.
The interplay of Clan and Sect realities shapes much
of a Kindred’s nightly experiences: A Camarilla Ventrue’s understanding of her city is radically different
from a Sabbat Tzimisce’s perspective.

Clans
The way Clans function varies. Some are closely
knit, almost fraternal organizations with distinct agendas and focused hierarchies. Others are little more
than a predilection toward certain Disciplines and an
exploitable flaw in the blood. Ultimately, what Clan
means to each vampire is unique, and some Kindred
may be very proud of their Clan while others don’t give
it much thought. Ultimately, though, each Clan tends
towards certain common behaviors, perceptions, or
roles in Kindred society.
The Assamites are silent masters of assassination,
killing for hire and collecting blood for rituals to bring
them closer to their progenitor.
The Brujah were once philosopher-kings of an ancient civilization, but are now rebels and rogues with a
fearsome inclination toward frenzy.
The Followers of Set venerate a chthonic God while
seeking out the world’s secret places and protecting ancient artifacts.
The Gangrel are bestial and untamed, often coming
to resemble the animals over which they demonstrate
mastery.
The Giovanni are an insular family of vampires who
practice the art of commanding the dead while commanding global finances, as they have since the Renaissance.

20

The Lasombra are proud nobles who command the
very essence of darkness and shadow — to the point of
worshiping it, some say.
The Malkavians are a Clan fractured by madness,
each member irrevocably suffering under the yoke of
insanity.
The Nosferatu are hideously disfigured by the Embrace, so they keep to the sewers shadows and traffic in
the secrets they collect.
The Ravnos are nomads and tricksters who can force
the mind to see what isn’t there, though they are slaves
to the vices they indulge in.
The Toreador enjoy every sensual pleasure the world
has to offer, idolizing physical beauty and the adoration of their thralls.
The Tremere wield the supernatural power of their
sorcerous past, though they became vampires through
treachery and artifice.
The Tzimisce are eldritch Old World lords who
have little in common with the mortal world and can
manipulate flesh and bone at a whim.
The Ventrue observe the noblesse oblige of vampire
society, though their entitlement and greed encourages
them to seek ever more at the expense of others.
The Caitiff have no inherent Clan society, support,
or even characteristics; they are like orphans among
the great families of vampires.

Sects
Sect — a vampire’s political and philosophical affiliation — is ostensibly a matter of choice. If a Cainite
dwells in a Sabbat city, however, she’s almost certainly
a Sabbat member whether she wants to be or not, and
a vampire in a Camarilla-held city had better have an
exquisite explanation if he chooses not to honor the
word of the Prince.
Each Sect has a dogma and an objective its members
seek to attain. Being broadly distributed organizations
populated by creatures as selfish as vampires makes a
Sect’s nature in each city a unique thing. Some Sectdominated cities might be paragons of their organization’s virtues, while other pay only lip service to Sect
creeds. For more information on the Camarilla, the
Sabbat, the Anarchs, and the Independents, see Chapter Two, starting on p. 38. For more information on the
Traditions, see p. 22.

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

The Camarilla holds up the Traditions as the highest authority, with a figure known as the Prince acting
as the ultimate authority to both interpret and enforce
those laws in each domain. First and foremost, the
Camarilla sees its role as maintaining the Masquerade, but in domains with accomplished Kindred, the
conflicts between them regularly bring the rest of the
Traditions into consideration as well. The Camarilla
considers itself a well-heeled Sect of genteel vampires,
and the term Kindred originates with it, in the idea
that all members of the Camarilla are peers in the same
august organization. Of course, the social hierarchy of
the Camarilla is an elaborate construct, and vicious
interpersonal politics and ancient grudges shape the
nightly affairs of the “Ivory Tower.”
The Sabbat holds an apocalyptic outlook, believing
that the time for Gehenna is nigh, and the Ancients
will soon rise from their graves and devour their errant
get. It has little regard for the Traditions other than
immediate self-preservation, and its domains are hellish urban warzones where people may well have seen
vampire activity but simply chalk it up to the weirdness
and horror of the World of Darkness. The Masquerade
(or “The Silence of the Blood,” as they call it) is tenuous in Sabbat domains, and much of its poor relation-

ship with the Camarilla owes to its recklessness and
shortsighted brand of fiery fanaticism. The Sabbat believes that ultimately, vampires must assert their place
over the mortal world instead of hiding from it, if they
are to survive the fangs of their creators. Part fanatical
death worshippers, part millennial doomsday cult, the
“Sword of Caine” is neither subtle nor tolerant.
The Anarch Movement is localized and sporadic,
without any real central organization outside the individual cities where it establishes itself. In fact, the
Camarilla considers the “Anarchs” under its own purview. The central tenet of the Anarchs is that rule by
elders is an outmoded concept, and that Kindred domains should be governed by merit, with a fundamental respect for the individual Kindred. Effectively, the
Movement seeks to redistribute the power in domains
from the hands of the old elite into a more equitable
arrangement. While this may seem modern and reasonable, that’s not how Kindred society works in most
domains, and those who already benefit from consolidated power find the idea laughable at best and treasonous at worst. As well, many Anarchs style themselves
as revolutionaries, willing to do whatever it takes to
strip power from the corrupt old guard who hoard it.
These are no utopian domains of happy Kindred-kine

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

21

relationships. These are petty kingdoms ruled by individual undead lords of whatever territory they can
seize.
The Inconnu is an enigmatic elder Sect about which
little is known. Indeed, it seems less of a cogent Sect
and more of a confederation of Kindred who seek the
state of Golconda, a sort of redemptive transcendence
of Damnation. The Sect rarely has more than one or
two Kindred in any given domain, and territory acquisitions don’t appear to be part of its agenda. A few
territories belong to prominent Inconnu, and thus the
Sect may be said to be dominant in that domain, but in
most cases of Inconnu presence, a “Monitor” takes up
residence in another Sect’s domain to watch its affairs
and pursue her own salvation. What the Sect formally
wants — if anything — remains unknown, and speculation runs rampant as to their origin. Some believe
that they are little more than a cult of would-be gods
while others suspect that they are the remnants of an
ancient Roman conspiracy that pre-dates the modern
idea of Sects.
The Tal’Mahe’Ra is a bizarre paranoid conspiracy of
a Sect that spends little time in contact with the other
factions of Kindred society. Very little is known about
the “True Black Hand,” and some Kindred consider
stories of its existence apocryphal. Its stronghold lies
in the Underworld, the realm of the dead occupied by
ghosts of things long lost to the modern world. Its mission seems to be one of shepherding and protecting the
world toward an end only it understands. Their vision
is similar to the First City as described in the Book of
Nod. The Sect holds no cities in the physical world as
its domains, though it maintains estates and other odd
nexuses where it breeds ghoul servants and sends its
agents forth into the world.
The Independent Clans often function like smallscale Sects themselves, with specific agendas in mind,
though this is not always the case.

Autarkis
Not every Kindred belongs to a Sect, nor swears fealty to a Clan, Prince, Bishop, or other such entity.
These Autarkis often lead solitary unlives not unlike
hermits or outcasts. The lot of the Autarkis is unique
in every case — what drove her into self-rule, and why
does the local Sect allow an individual to flout its primacy? In some cases, an Autarkis is beneath notice, as
with a Nosferatu who keeps to his warrens on the outskirts of town or an irretrievably damaged Malkavian
who dwells in the Barrens. In other cases, the Autarkis

22

is simply too powerful or otherwise ungovernable for
the local Sect to bring under its sway. These latter are
often terrifying, warlike when prodded, and nearly legendary in the domain. If you’re such a badass that you
can thumb your nose at every pack of Templars or Archon strike team the local Kindred call in to force you
to toe the line, you’d make a fine Autarkis.

The Traditions
Vampires observe a set of customs that exists somewhere between being coded into their undead natures
and a social contract that’s ratified every night among
the courts of the Damned. Not every vampire affords
the idea of the Traditions the respect they deserve —
the Sabbat in particular make bold claims about the
flaws of the Traditions and the weak wills of those who
hide behind them — but in practice, most vampires
observe the Traditions to some extent. This is most
true of the Masquerade, for as bold as the Sabbat or
Anarchs may be, even they don’t have the concentrated might to stand against a world of mortals who learn
the secret that the undead walk among them.
Interpreting and enforcing the Traditions is the
privilege and responsibility of the Kindred Prince. In
some domains, particularly those of non-Camarilla
Sects, both the titles and the Traditions themselves
may vary, but the core principle is found everywhere:
That an undead authority makes the rules and woe to
any who feel that they don’t have to heed them.

The First Tradition: The Masquerade
This is the most important Tradition, for its observance protects the race of Caine from discovery by a
mortal world that would unite against them in fear
and hatred. Many Princes and other Kindred authorities spend a great deal of time using their influence or
wealth to cover up breaches of the Masquerade, for the
greater good of the Damned who may not even understand the peril in which they place themselves when
they breach it. The Camarilla tends to err on the side
of the pragmatic, cultivating its power from the shadows, but the Sabbat longs for a time when the Masquerade is no longer necessary, when mortals are little
more than blood-thralls born into the shackles of their
vampiric masters.

The Second Tradition: The Domain
Of all the Traditions, Princes often employ the widest
range of interpretations when it comes to the Second

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

The First Tradition:
The Masquerade
Thou shall not reveal thy true nature to those not of the Blood.
Doing such shall renounce thy claims of Blood.

The Second Tradition:
The Domain
Thy domain is thine own concern.
All others owe thee respect while in it.
None may challenge thy word while in thy domain.

The Third Tradition:
The Progeny
Thou shall only Sire another with the permission of thine Elder.
If thou createst another without thine Elder’s leave, both thou and thy Progeny shall be slain.

The Fourth Tradition:
The Accounting
Those thou create are thine own children.
Until thy Progeny shall be Released, thou shall command them in all things.
Their sins are thine to endure.

The Fifth Tradition:
Hospitality
Honor one another’s domain.
When thou comest to a foreign city, thou shall present thyself to the one who ruleth there.
Without the word of acceptance, thou art nothing.

The Sixth Tradition:
Destruction
Thou art forbidden to destroy another of thy kind.
The right of destruction belongeth only to thine Elder.
Only the Eldest among thee shall call the Blood Hunt.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

23

Tradition. Some Princes maintain that the Second Tradition applies only to those of their station, that a given
city is entirely a Prince’s domain and that everyone in
it owes him fealty and perhaps tribute. Other Princes
are much more liberal, granting each (acknowledged)
Kindred in her domain the power of sovereignty over
their own territory. Most Princes fall somewhere in the
middle, acknowledging that each Kindred makes his
own fortune and has a right to authority in areas accepted as his, but not complete autonomy.

The Third Tradition: The Progeny
Many if not most Princes require that prospective
sires seek their permission before performing the Embrace to create fledglings. However, some domains interpret “thine elder” to signify either the elder of one’s
own Clan, or even one’s own sire. Note that such liberal domains are often the ones with the greatest Kindred populations, and often ones that come closest to
jeopardizing the Masquerade due to Kindred overpopulation.

The Fourth Tradition: The Accounting
This Tradition imposes a twofold rule. First, a sire
effectively owns her progeny until such a time as she
deems them fit to face Kindred society on their own.
Second, a wayward childe brings trouble upon his sire’s
head, for the sire is responsible for the actions and consequences of her childe until the point at which she is
emancipated. This Tradition is simultaneously at the
center of some Kindred’s policy of making their childer
earn their freedom through a long and arduous process,
and other Kindred’s policy of, “Fuck it; you’re a vampire now. Don’t ruin it for the rest of us or I’ll tear your
heart out myself. Good luck.”

The Fifth Tradition: Hospitality
A Prince has the right to dictate who may stay in his
domain and who must leave or suffer punishment. This
Tradition also imposes the responsibility on a traveling or relocating Kindred to present herself to the
local Kindred authority and make herself known and
accountable for any missteps. Again, this Tradition’s
enforcement falls to the whim of individual Princes.
Some are iron-fisted dictators who demand to know
the comings and goings of all the Kindred in their cities, while others don’t mind so much as everyone heeds
the other Traditions and doesn’t disturb the social order.

24

The Sixth Tradition: Destruction
The Blood Hunt — the Lextalionis — is the Princely
decree that declares another vampire persona non grata.
The right of Princes (or “elders,” depending upon the
interpretation of the Tradition) to call the Blood Hunt
effectively forfeits the hunted Kindred’s unlife; it is
the ultimate punishment levied for the most grievous
of crimes. Indeed, it is used so sparing and so severely
in most domains that many Princes will even pardon
those Kindred who perform diablerie on a vampire under the Lextalionis.

Domains of the Dead
A city’s Kindred society and even its mortal character
depend a great deal upon which Sect holds sway there,
or if any Sect holds sway at all. Camarilla domains such
as Chicago, London, and Paris look and feel a great
deal differently from Sabbat strongholds such as Mexico City, Detroit, and Montreal, which likewise have a
different cast than Anarch cities like Los Angeles, San
Diego, and San Francisco.
Individual Kindred define these domains, of course,
but simply learning which titles a city employs for its
high-status vampires can offer a wealth of insight to
the observer. For instance, if a Kindred learns that Detroit has an Archbishop, he’s pretty well assured that
the city belongs to the Sabbat, while discovering that
all of London is Prince Mithras’ domain lets the vampire know that the city is one of Camarilla allegiance.
The following titles describe the Sect alignment and
duties of that title. Note that not every domain has
a member of every given title. Indeed, some domains
have many members with a given title, while in others,
certain powerful Kindred may hold numerous titles, or
there might be so few competent Kindred that each
vampire must attend to multiple responsibilities.

Prince (Camarilla)
The preeminent vampire of a Camarilla city and
probably the most numerous position of ultimate authority among Western Kindred, Princes are the rulers of given cities. Some Princes are tyrants or absolute
monarchs of the Damned while others are politically
feeble puppets propped up by more powerful supporters, but the position of Prince is one acknowledged
and even (grudgingly) respected by all vampires, even
those not of the Camarilla.

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

A Prince’s duties and privileges are many, but the
most important is the interpretation and enforcement
of the Traditions, particularly the Masquerade. Beyond
that, a Prince has any individual powers he can claim
and uphold, such as declaring Elysium, calling a Blood
Hunt, adjudicating disputes between residents of his
domain, the right to claim a blood-tribute, and potentially even the right to name, ignore, or even disband
the Primogen.

freedom fighter. A Baron forever straddles a fine line
between being a wise leader and a power-mad autocrat,
and the impractical nature of revolutionary ideology
dooms many of them when the nightly affairs of the
domain need attention.

Kindred of any age can in theory be Princes, but in
reality, praxis — the right of Princes to rule — goes
only so far as the Kindred members of a domain respect
and allow it. A weak or young Prince might be ineffectual or even a laughingstock, while just speaking the
name of the aforementioned Mithras or Prince Lodin
of Chicago might be enough to cause a shiver of fear
down the spines of those cities’ vampires.

Harpy: Harpies are the opinion leaders and the
trend-setters to whom other Kindred look when it
comes to matters of taste, style, philosophy, or politics. A Harpy’s word influences the domain’s attitudes
and can be a powerful supporter of the status quo or a
force for insidious change. Harpies are rarely appointed
directly (and Kindred rarely trust those who are). Instead, a Harpy paradoxically becomes so by acting as
a Harpy. The Harpy’s role is often intertwined with
domain politics, and it is a bold or foolish Prince who
neglects those vampires who represent the cutting edge
of popular opinion in her domain.

The role of Prince is a complex and varied one and
much has been said about it, but ultimately, a Prince is
master of the domain.

Archbishop (Sabbat)
With many of the same powers as the Prince, the
Archbishop is the closest analog the Sabbat has to that
position. An Archbishop is different, though, in that
the Sabbat is less concerned with enforcing the Traditions and more concerned with waging its holy war
against the Antediluvians and everyone else. Thus,
the Archbishop is part spiritual leader and part warlord, advancing the Sword of Caine’s agenda and establishing Cainite primacy. This last is a difficult task
to undertake, as it’s not simply a question of turning a
Sabbat city into a living hell and declaring that vampires rule; the fundamentals of the Masquerade and the
sheer weight of the mortal population means that is
a war to be waged in stages. Too many Sabbat fail to
understand this, especially among the young, and lose
faith in their leadership because they’re too impatient
to play out the long-game Jyhad. This subversion of ignorance is perhaps the Archbishop’s greatest challenge
to overcome.

Baron (Anarch Movement)
Much of Anarch philosophy decries the tyranny of
Princes, but despite their name, the Anarchs often recognize that leadership in a domain is necessary. Thus,
the Baron: a Prince in all but name and reputation.
Many Barons take great pains to avoid Camarilla-style
autocracy, but power can corrupt even the most zealous

Other Titles
Camarilla

Keeper of Elysium: This is a largely honorific title,
though it has many practical responsibilities. The
Keeper of Elysium assures that the customs of Elysium
are observed, and is a caretaker of sites declared Elysium by a Prince.
Scourge: In this time, which many elders believe to
be the Time of Thin Blood, the Scourge is responsible
for destroying those vampires of 14th and higher Generation. This is a position most often found in paranoid
domains where elders believe that fighting the symptoms of the Final Nights will stave off the coming of
Gehenna.
Sheriff: The Sheriff is the Prince’s right-hand Kindred, responsible for the physical enforcement of
Princely decree. Some Sheriffs are diligent masters-atarms while others are thuggish, bloody fuckheads who
abuse their authority to torment those beneath their
station. A Sheriff may appoint Hounds to assist him
(or the Prince may appoint them, in the interests of
curtailing a Sheriff’s overt power).
Primogen: Primogen is a flexible title. In some domains, a Primogen is simply the eldest and most influential Kindred of a given Clan. In others, a Primogen
is a member of a council of advisors to the Prince. In
some domains, Princes appoint the Primogen (and
they may even appoint multiple Primogen of the same
Clan, to keep that Clan divided) while in other cities,
Primogen arise from among the most powerful members of that Clan or as a result of popular Clan politics.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

25

This is perhaps the most difficult of Camarilla titles for
a new Kindred to understand.
Justicar: These are the judges appointed by the Inner Circle to be the Camarilla’s eyes, hands and, if necessary, fists. It is the Justicars who decide the punishment for those who have violated the Traditions on a
widespread level. A Justicar serves for 13 years, and her
actions may be challenged only by another Justicar.
Archon: Each Justicar selects a number of minions,
known as Archons, to act in his name as suits his purposes. Archons are typically chosen from the upper
ranks of ancillae and occasionally elders of lesser station. Justicars occasionally choose Archons to carry
out specific missions, and prefer political savvy, insight, and skill over standing and clout. An Archon’s
position typically lasts for as long as a Justicar wishes to
retain her, but no longer than the Justicar’s tenure.
Alastor: If the Archons and Justicars are the law
enforcement agencies of the Camarilla, the Alastors
are the secret police. Moving unseen and unnoticed
through the Camarilla, they serve a variety of purposes
at the Inner Circle’s command. Mostly, however, the
Alastors hunt the most dangerous criminals to the Camarilla — those on the so-called “Red List.” While the

26

anonymous existence of the Alastors can be a difficult
one, it does have its rewards, specifically a more-or-less
universal immunity to prosecution from local Princes.
The Inner Circle: The true hub of the Camarilla,
this group meets once every 13 years to plan out the
business and direction of vampire society — as much as
any group can presume to dictate the doings of a race of
immortal predators. Every Clan is permitted one representative, usually the eldest member of the Clan, as
only the eldest may cast the Clan’s vote.

Sabbat
Ductus: Leaders of individual packs, Ducti attend to the
operation matters of their charges, resembling gang leaders or chiefs of small tribes. The title of Ductus is largely
honorific, according recognition to the most accomplished
member of a pack. Some authority accompanies the title,
but the Ductus who throws his weight around is likely to
find his ass dumped unceremoniously in a trash bin, if not
staked out to welcome the next sunrise.
Pack Priest: Priests bear the responsibility for the
spiritual wellbeing of their packs. Second in command
to the Ductus, the Pack Priest officiates all the rituals
observed by the pack, and often creates a few for the
sole use of the pack. All packs have at least one Pack

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

Priest, though some rare and large packs have two.
In the event that the Ductus is eliminated, the Pack
Priest becomes a temporary leader until a new leader
can be appointed by the Bishop, Archbishop, or (in
autonomous packs) the pack itself.
Templar: Also known as Paladins, the Templars are
an elite force of bodyguards appointed by a Bishop or
greater leader. Templars serve a variety of duties, always
in a martial capacity. Most Archbishops keep a cadre
of Paladins in their retinues to handle delicate matters
best solved by a judicious application of violence.
Bishop: Bishops are those immediately below the
Archbishop in Sabbat domains, with the same highlevel duties but much narrower scope. A Bishop may
be in charge of a single aspect of Cainite unlife in the
domain, or she may be a more general spiritual leader,
inquisitor against diabolism, military general, or any
other specific aspect of Sabbat agenda. Some Sabbat
domains have no Archbishop, but are instead ruled by
a council of Bishops.
Priscus: Superficially, a Priscus is similar to a Primogen, but is never appointed by an Archbishop or
Bishop; Prisci rise to the rank over time and according
to no specific criteria. A Priscus, politically, is an advisor to the local Sabbat authority figures, with no formal
role in Sect politics but great practical influence.
Cardinal: Cardinals oversee Sabbat affairs in large
geographical regions. As the superiors of the Archbishops, Cardinals coordinate the Sabbat in their cities and
direct them in the Jyhad. Further, it is their direct duty
to bring any cities within their territory under the Sabbat’s sway. Most Sabbat see their Cardinals no more
than once per year, if at all, as the duties of the office
keep them in constant communication with Bishops,
Archbishops, Prisci, and the Regent herself.
Regent: The Regent is the ultimate authority over
all of the Sabbat, ruling the Sect from the Sabbat
stronghold in Mexico City. Each of the Archbishops
or councils of Bishops is ultimately accountable to the
Regent.

The Mythology of
the Damned
Exactly what causes the state of vampirism is a source
of much debate among the Damned. Even though most
Kindred agree on their point of origin, the idea itself is
inherently unverifiable, and the points of contention

even within the accepted dogma are numerous enough
to fuel any number of holy wars.

First Vampire, First Murderer
And the Lord said unto him, “Therefore whosoever
slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold.”
And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him
should kill him.
— Genesis 4:15
With these words, many vampires trace their origins
back to Biblical times. Caine, son of Adam and brother
of Abel, slew his sibling in sacrifice to God, and in so
doing was cast out, becoming the first vampire as God
withdrew His grace from the exile.
Thereupon, the tale diverges any number of times,
but most Kindred scholars, eschatologists, priests, and
speculators agree on this first point.
Caine, as the First Vampire, wandered the Land of
Nod, where he eventually passed on his curse, Embracing those who would become known as the Second
Generation. Their names are lost or vaguely known
— the names most commonly agreed upon are Enoch,
Irad, and Zillah — and they eventually begat the Third
Generation, who would become the progenitors of
what Kindred understand tonight as Clans. The chronology of Caine’s life, curse, and subsequent travails
are recorded in the Book of Nod, a document as close
to a “vampire Bible” as the Kindred are apt to come.
The book itself is as much myth as fact: Any number
of editions of varying reliability have surfaced in the
millennia since Abel’s death, from crude clay tablets
to the most widely accepted version, collected by the
renegade Aristotle de Laurent and disseminated by
his protégés and allies. Even Aristotle’s version is suspect, as it contains Kindred apocrypha from a variety
of sources, and the whole thing itself cannot possibly
be original. Still, as an item of faith, it commands the
hearts and minds of many Kindred, from fiery Sabbat
priests to spiritual Camarilla disciples and devout Anarchs.
Long have the Kindred sought Caine himself, though
the First Vampire hasn’t been reliably sighted outside
the Biblical times that provided his origin. Still, unverifiable Caine sightings have shown up throughout
time, as Kindred seek for any symbol of faith to anchor their despair or dread. Likewise, fragments of the
Book of Nod occasionally surface in various domains or
among ruins that just happen to find their way back
into Kindred possession.

The whole matter of Caine and the Book of Nod is a
powder keg each time it rises to prominence in a given city. The Camarilla generally believes the myth of
Caine to be just that: a parable with perhaps some basis
in truth, but largely symbolic. The Sabbat takes the
whole matter quite literally, and their faith in doomsday prophecies (many of which originate with the
Book of Nod itself) causes no end of strife. The matter
of Caine is indeed a religion among vampires, fraught
with all of the zealotry, intolerance, devotion, pride,
and fear that accompany all matters of faith.
How is it, then, that some foundation of the tale of
Caine survives and even thrives among all Kindred?
The answer is simple: The potency of a Kindred’s vitae reflects her distance in Embrace genealogy from the
First Vampire.

Generation
Among vampires, the notion of Generation is a concept that describes how distant one is from the First
Vampire. When a Kindred Embraces, her childe rises
from death one Generation higher than she — one
more Generation removed from Caine. The Clan
founders comprised the Third Generation, their progeny became the Fourth Generation, their childer became the Fifth Generation, and so on and so forth up
through the distant Thirteenth Generation prevalent
in the modern nights.
This explanation creates confusion of its own, however. “Third Generation” ostensibly means that these
Antediluvians were three Generations away from
Caine, but the prevailing mythology names only two.
If Caine himself isn’t “zero Generation,” what is he one
Generation removed from?
Generation determines a great deal about Kindred
potential. Mastery of certain Disciplines relies upon a
certain threshold of Generation, for example, as does
the ability to store vast quantities of blood within the
vampire’s body. Some ancient Kindred need to feed
only when the desire takes them, so great are their reserves of vitae.

Diablerie: The Amaranth
Along with advanced Generation comes a price,
however. Generation equals raw power potential, and
those of higher Generation seek the power of their elders. By slaking one’s thirst on the heart’s blood of a
vampire of lower Generation — drinking the vampire’s
soul in a transgression known as diablerie — a Kindred
can lower her own Generation.

28

Naturally, the elders hate and fear diablerie (though
it would surprise many neonates and ancillae to discover how many elders attained their own Generational
potency by destroying their own sires and elders). Also
known as Amaranth, diablerie is the greatest crime a
Kindred can commit against another vampire.
… At least in some circumstances. In others, diablerie is not only permitted but encouraged. For example, a Prince who declares a Blood Hunt often decrees
that those who diablerize the outcast will be pardoned.
Further, in the Sabbat and in certain Anarch domains,
diablerie is an acceptable (and even honored) method
of promotion and advancement. After all, if a vampire
lets himself be diablerized, well, he must have been too
weak to use that power effectively.

Understanding the
Generations
Although Generation conceptually has only a finite
number of gradations, the significance of the Generations is more important than a mere ordinal number.
Certain Generations correspond to certain social distinctions of the Damned, and a Kindred’s Generation
may mark her for a vast and terrible destiny or as the
harbinger of a dread fate.

Second Generation
The most widely acknowledged version of the Book
of Nod claims the number of second Generation Kindred is three. In its chronicles, Caine Embraced these
unknowable Ancients to dwell with him in his great
city of Enoch and give him succor. Given to the “Antediluvian” moniker of the Third Generation, those
Kindred who delve into such mysteries assume that the
Second Generation was slain either during the Deluge
or in the kinslayer times following the Flood. As one
might expect, all those of age are reluctant to speak of
their sires and the great strife that overcame them all.
Undoubtedly, some know more than they are revealing.
Were any of the Second Generation still in existence
today, they would be impossibly powerful beings. Some
Clans claim that their progenitors are in fact members of the Second Generation rather than the Third
Generation, as is commonly assumed of Clan founders.
These claims are viewed as everything from prideful
boasts to foulest heresy by those who place great stock
in matters regarding Kindred origin.

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

Third Generation
Numerous terrifying tales of the Third Generation
exist, though the names of only two, Lucian and Mekhet, are widely known. Tonight, they are referred to
as the Antediluvians, and they are the founders of the
13 great Clans. If any survive, they remain hidden, intentionally obscured by the depredations of the Jyhad.
They may still exist, collectively or in some fraction of
their original number, but now instead of openly warring as the Book of Nod recounts, they move in a deeper
struggle. Indeed, Jyhad seems to be their primary engagement, as they jealously thwart whatever moves
their opponents make.
The actions of the Antediluvians range from something as petty as the acquisition of a piece of artwork
to grand schemes involving nations, and almost none
are classifiable as the movements of Ancients while
they’re happening, so subtle are these inhuman master
vampires. Those of the Third Generation must by this
point be wholly other, split between those who would
share the world with mortals and those who would remake the world so that it quivers beneath their gaze.
Alternatively, some among the Third Generation may
have reached Golconda or seek to help others of their
kind attain this state. Of course, they, too, must play at
Jyhad with the other ancients who do not wish this to
come to pass.
Those of the Third Generation are terrible beings,
with abilities and powers only guessed at by their lessers, having been Kindred for eons longer than they
held mortal perspectives. Some say they can die the
Final Death only if they choose or are slain by one of
equal power. Is this, perhaps, the Jyhad — a maneuvering to see who shall be the last of their kind?

Fourth and Fifth Generations
These vampires are known as the Methuselahs, and
they are nearly as powerful and secretive as the Antediluvians. Those of the Fourth and Fifth Generations are
most often the most powerful allies, agents, or pawns in
the Jyhad, as their power perhaps nears the prestige of
the Third Generation. As a result, their numbers have
dwindled throughout millennia of conflict with each
other and greater, darker entities. Few of this Generation remain active. Some may seek refuge among
the Inconnu or Tal’Mahe’Ra to avoid the Jyhad and
diablerie. The Inner Circle of the Camarilla is said to
consist of multiple Methuselahs. Some critics believe
that the true purpose of the Sects is to blunt the efforts
of the Third Generation to manipulate the younger

Generations. Although the power of blood of Caine
falls off greatly this many Generations removed, those
of the Fourth Generation are still extremely powerful,
godlike in the eyes of a mortal or fledgling vampire.

Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth
Generations
Vampires of these Generations are the ones most
commonly described as elders, and they remain deeply
involved in Kindred society. Their movements dominate the actions of the most populous Sects (at least
to hear them tell it), and their numbers comprise the
majority of local authorities. Those who remain in positions of visibility tend to be important figures: leaders of Clans or bloodlines, Princes, Primogen, Bishops,
Archbishops, Anarch Barons, and the most notable
Autarkis. Many of the Princes of European cities tend
to be of the Sixth Generation. Princes of American cities tend to be of the Seventh or Eighth Generations.
Colloquially, the members of the Eighth Generation
seem to be the last Kindred described as elders by those
even older than they. Perhaps it is because the majority
of them were created before the modern age, and that
is evident in their manner and bearing. Then again,
perhaps it is very dry sarcasm directed toward everyone
below the rank of an irascible Methuselah.

Ninth and Tenth Generations
Although they are occasionally called elders, these
Kindred just as often move with members of the
younger Generations, especially in the New World.
Members of these Generations are frequently called
ancillae, though this is often based on age and accomplishment more than Generation. Most were created
in the modern era, and thus are somewhat alien in
temperament to the older Kindred. In more ways than
one, they bridge the gap between the neonates and the
true elders.

Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth
Generations
The most recent Generations of Kindred are often
called neonates. Most of the Kindred in the modern
nights belong to these Generations — they may outnumber the elder Generations by four-to-one or more.
Born within recent memory, the Kindred of these Generations are products of societies that have received the
benefits of, and been victims of, rapid change. Most
tellingly, these are the young Kindred who are most adept with modern technology. They are not only unfazed

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

29

by but actually accustomed to information traveling at
the speed of digital data, and would find a handwritten message dispatched on horseback to a superstitious
peasant village 500 miles away unspeakably quaint and
inefficient. These are the Kindred of the information
generation, the ones using social media and computers
and changing what it means to be a vampire.

Fourteenth and Fifteenth Generations
There are exceedingly few Kindred of these Generations, and none beyond. Indeed, those of the 15th
Generation have failed to sire any progeny. Their
blood is far too thin, and they are too removed from
Caine, to be able to pass on the curse. Rumors persist
about vampires siring not childer but children and other
things never before wondered at in the Book of Nod.
But the Book of Nod is definitely clear about one thing:
The rise of the Thin-Blooded is one of the signs of the
End Times, and Gehenna is nigh.

Gehenna
As vampires tell it, the time of Gehenna is the end
of the world, at least for their race. The skies will rain
blood and purge their numbers from the world. The
slumbering Antediluvians will rouse themselves from
their primordial slumber and devour their childer.
Caine himself will return and demand an accounting
of his degenerate race, and God himself will strike the
Kindred from the face of Creation into hell itself.
All Kindred fear Gehenna, whether they consciously
believe in it or not. The reason is plain: Few of them
believed in vampires before they became Kindred, and
the dawning horror that there is more in the world
than the mortal imagination can fathom can certainly
prove frightfully true even to the vain Cainite frame
of mind.
Gehenna is not a question of if, but when. Only the
most stubborn of Kindred could possibly ignore the
litany of prophecies that spell out the conclusion of
the End Times. The End is here. When is the End of
the End?

Golconda
The constant pressure of paranoia, apocalypse, Jyhad, and the existential horror of subsisting on human
blood is too much for some Kindred. Indeed, given
eternity, who would want to spend it in the state of
terror that surrounds the Kindred on any given night?
In order to ease themselves out of the Jyhad and the
predatory state of being, some vampires pursue the
path of Golconda. According to rumor, Golconda is

30

an enlightened state somehow “beyond” vampirism,
wherein the Kindred no longer must worry about the
Beast or its base hungers.
Golconda’s fabled state may eclipse its truth. Few
Kindred know anyone who claims to have achieved
Golconda, and fewer still have actually reached its
lofty heights. None can say exactly what Golconda is,
and it remains a matter of faith or an objective of philosophy more so than actual practice. Are those who
have reached Golconda saints who have transcended
what it means to be a vampire, or have they somehow
managed to free themselves from the burdens of vampirism? Is the vampire in Golconda beatific, or is she a
monster without even those moral underpinnings that
challenge the rest of the Cainite race?
Those who have attained Golconda offer no answers.

Other Denizens of the
World of Darkness
Vampires aren’t the only supernatural creatures to
stalk the shadows of the World of Darkness. The darkness belongs to many other mysterious and horrific entities, some of whom also prey on mortals, while others
exist among them or even protect them… sometimes.
If any generality can be made about these others,
though, it’s that the Kindred don’t know much about
them. The converse is equally true, and any interaction between the race of Caine and the other monsters
who prowl the night is going to be tentative and suspicious, if not downright hostile and violent.
For more information on these antagonists, see
Chapter Nine.

Hunters
What remains of the Inquisition — the post-medieval
“hammer of witches” endowed by the Church with the
means and authority to stamp out heresy and diabolism
— still exists tonight, albeit in a much changed format.
Tonight, the Inquisition and other vampire hunters
hunt the creatures of the night with firearms as well as
faith, and with an uncanny insight that makes underestimating these individuals very dangerous. Government agencies also keep an eye on the movements of
the undead, and even unaffiliated groups have a keen
interest in the supernatural occupants of the world
they share. These agents are all mortal — at least, so

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

the Kindred hope — though some possess knacks or
abilities that can only be described as supernatural.

Werewolves
One of the reasons the Kindred keep to their urban
domains is that the wilderness beyond the glow of the
city lights harbors the Lupines. These savage creatures
appear to be mad with rage, changing into their wolfform seemingly at will and lashing out violently when
someone rouses their ire. Some even believe they can
step wholly out of the world and into a realm of moonshadow, where vampires may not follow. They wage an
ages-old war with the Damned that few Kindred understand tonight, though they certainly comprehend
the catastrophic violence the wolf-men are able to inflict. Indeed, even a young Lupine seems to be at least a
match for an entire coterie or pack of vampires, so wild
are they in combat, and so resilient. A few bold groups
of vampires hunt Lupines for thrill or duty, but when
the prey is something that has the ability to strike down
even a potent elder, wiser Kindred choose the path of
avoidance.

Magi
As Shakespeare once said, “there are more things in
heaven and earth… than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” So it is with the magi, exceptionally gifted
mortals who have the ability to simply will their desires
into being. In simplest terms, the magi wield “magick,”
but there is more to it than that: They possess a cosmic
understanding and acumen that eludes even the sorcerous Tremere and the seekers of secrets among the
Followers of Set. As Kindred understand it, the magi
are mortal and thus comparatively fragile, but few wish
to put to the test the incomprehensible wiles of an enlightened witch who has the power to slay a Cainite
with a thought or who can summon a gout of holy fire
to scorch a vampire to cinders from within. The magi
seem to have various orders and schools of magick
among themselves, but these distinctions are largely
irrelevant to vampires, who feel that the witches see
them as a sort of commodity to be collected or as a
mystery to be dissected and mastered.

The Wild Ones
Nature spirits, faeries, the Good Folk, the Others.
Whatever the local term for them is, they are the alien
outsiders who have claimed dominion over the strange
corners of the world since before Man was sophisticat-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

31

ed enough to sense their passing. They are a strange
confederation of legends, possessed of inscrutable goals
and unknowable desires. A Kindred who crosses paths
with one may depart with only a vague sense of good
fortune, while the next time he earns the attention of
the fae, he may lose his very identity. If any general
statement may be made about the Others, they seem
to belong to two different courts of philosophy, but
neither of them has any consideration for vampires, so
dealings depend entirely on each creature’s caprices.
Fortunately, the faeries have no overarching interest
in vampiric affairs. If, by some tragedy, they take an
interest, the vampires may well find themselves victims
of cruel jokes or deadly vendettas.

Lexicon
The Kindred have their own dialect of specialized
words and phrases. Vampires have a tremendous capacity for double-talk; what they say often means
something other than or in addition to its literal interpretation. Certain words have evolved new connotations among the Damned, while others are unique to
vampires and their society. The Kindred, set in their
ways as they are, are loath to adopt new manners of
speech or slang, and one can often determine a rough
estimation of a vampire’s age by listening to the individual words she chooses.

Common Parlance

Ghosts
Vampires aren’t the only denizens of the World of
Darkness to persist beyond the event of death. There is
a Veil between the worlds of the living and dead, and
any number of ghosts, spirits, shades, wraiths, and other
remnants of the unquiet departed attend to their unresolved matters this side of it. Some Kindred comprehend the mysteries of wraiths, such as the necromantic
Giovanni and perhaps a few macabre Tremere or enigmatic members of the True Black Hand, but even these
vampires deal with the restless dead on their own terms
rather than those of the ghosts themselves. Sages, scholars, and eschatologists among the race of Caine believe
that the ghosts have a complex and immortal empire of
their own beyond the Veil, and that those with whom
the Kindred come in contact are those somehow exiled
from the realms of the Underworld. Certainly, Cainites
kill enough of their vessels to create no few ghosts of
their own, and it’s often a cold confrontation with reality when one discovers that he’s haunted by the shade
of his last bloody conquest.

And Everything Else
Demons. Devils. Mummies. Shapeshifters. Golems.
Creations of abused science or perverted natural law.
These and more might occupy some tenebrous corner
of the World of Darkness, wielding powers heretofore
unseen by the Kindred or perhaps known only to cults
or secret societies. Whatever nightmare form a horror
takes, it’s probably out there, seething, hating both
the world of the living and the shadow world of the
Damned. Tread carefully, Kindred.

These words are in common use among all echelons
of Kindred society.

Caine’s blood is too diluted to pass on any consistent
characteristics.
Camarilla, The: A Sect of vampires devoted primarily to maintaining the Traditions, particularly that of
the Masquerade.

32

CHAPTER ONE: A WORLD OF DARKNESS

childe: A vampire created through the Embrace —
the childe is the progeny of her sire. This term is often used derogatorily, indicating inexperience. Plural
childer.
Clan: A group of vampires who share common characteristics passed on by the blood. There are 13 known

coterie: A small group of Kindred, united by the
need for support and sometimes common interests. In
the Sabbat, coteries are called “packs.”
diablerie: The consumption of another Kindred’s
blood, to the point of the victim’s Final Death. Vampires may lower their Generation permanently through
this abhorrent practice.
domain: The area of a particular vampire’s influence.
Princes claim entire cities as their domains, sometimes
allowing lesser vampires to claim domain within.
elder: A vampire who has experienced at least two
or more centuries of unlife. Elders are the most active
participants in the Jyhad.

Hunger, The: The urge to feed. For vampires, the

their lessers, using them as pawns in a terrible game
whose rules defy comprehension.
Kindred: The race of vampires as a whole, or a single
vampire. According to rumor, this term came about in
the 15th or 16th century, after the Great Anarch Revolt. Sabbat vampires scorn the term, preferring the

The Kiss causes feelings of ecstasy in those who receive
it.
Lupine: A werewolf, the natural and mortal enemy
of the vampire race. Plural Lupines.

the First Vampire a given vampire is.
ghoul: A minion created by giving a bit of vampiric
vitae to a mortal without draining her of blood first
(which would create a vampire instead).
haven: A vampire’s “home”; where she finds sanctuary from the sun.

Life, The: A euphemism for mortal blood. Many
Kindred regard this term as affected and effete.

to protect vampires from destruction at the hands of
mankind, the Masquerade was adopted after the Inquisition claimed many Kindred unlives.
Prince: A vampire who has claimed a given expanse
of domain as her own, generally a city, and supports
that claim against all others. The term can refer to a
Kindred of either sex. In the Sabbat, this Cainite is
called the “Archbishop,” and in Anarch cities she is
called the “Baron.”
Rogue: A vampire who feeds upon the vitae of other
Cainites, out of necessity or depravity.
Sabbat, The: A Sect of vampires that rejects humanity, embracing their monstrous natures. The Sabbat
is bestial and violent, preferring to lord over mortals
rather than hide from them.

Sects currently populating the night are the Camarilla,
the Sabbat, and the Anarch Movement.
sire: A vampire’s “parent”; the Kindred who created
her.
vessel: A source of vitae for sustenance or pleasure,
primarily mortal.

Old Form
The elders typically use these turns of phrase, which
have existed since long before the modern nights. One

they may be misconstrued as elders’ propaganda.
Amaranth: The act of consuming another Kindred’s
blood, q.v. diablerie.
ancilla: A “proven” vampire, between the elders and
the neonates. Plural ancillae.
Antediluvian: A member of the dreaded Third Generation, one of the eldest Kindred in existence.
antitribu: An “anti-Clan,” or one who has turned her
back on the Sect that her Clan has founded (usually by
joining the Sabbat). Some antitribu have evolved into

the true mastery of the Beast and balance of opposing urges and principles. Rumored to be similar to
mortal nirvana, Golconda is greatly touted but rarely
achieved.
Humanitas: The extent to which a Kindred still
maintains her humanity.
kine: A term for mortals, largely contemptuous. The
phrase “Kindred and kine” refers to the world at large;
everything.
Leech: A human who drinks vampire blood, yet acknowledges no master.

be a mortal and becomes one of the Kindred.
Damned, The: The race of Cainites; all vampires.
donor: A sarcastic term for a vessel, typically human.
Farmer: A term of mockery for vampires who refuse
to feed on human blood, instead taking sustenance
from animals.

Vulgar Argot

fief: A sarcastic term for a vampire’s domain or claim
thereof, most commonly used in reference to a Prince.

These terms are slang, the modern equivalents of
older turns of phrase which have fallen out of favor due
to their association with the elder ranks. These words
are associated with the younger Kindred, who seek to
establish their own vampiric cultures.

head: A Kindred who feeds upon those who have imbibed alcohol or drugs, so as to vicariously experience
the same sensations. Those Kindred who prefer individual drugs have their “poison” prefixed to the term
head (e.g., methhead, dopehead, smackhead).

Alleycat: A vampire who keeps no permanent haven,
but sleeps in a different location each night. This term
also refers to a vampire who feeds exclusively from the
homeless, vagrants, and other elements of low society.

Headhunter: A vampire who hunts and feeds from
other Kindred (see Rogue).

banking: The practice of “withdrawing” blood from
blood banks and hospital reserves. This blood has little

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Chapter Two:
Sects and Clans
"All the Kindred hid from one another and from the humans that surrounded them. In
hiding we remain today, for the Jyhad continues still."
- The Book of Nod

In the first nights, so sires tell their childer, the 13
grandchilder of Caine who survived the strife of the
First City begat progeny in their own images, passing
on their mystic arts and magical curses. Thus were
founded the 13 great Clans of Kindred that haunt the
world to this very night. Century followed century,
and each Clan developed its own history, traditions,
and lore. As the Jyhad raged and the Antediluvians
retreated into the wastelands, the childer of the Clans
assumed lordship of the night for themselves.
This chapter presents the 13 Clans, each claiming
descent from a mythical Antediluvian, that comprise
the majority the Children of Caine. Because the Clans
align themselves by Sect, we first cover the political
groups in which the Clans often find themselves. Players may select their characters’ Clans from one of these
13 templates, from one of the bloodlines or variants
presented in Chapter Ten, or may choose to be Clanless (Caitiff). Each Clan has certain distinguishing
powers and weaknesses, which a member of that Clan
automatically adopts.

Bloodlines

play peculiar characteristics, and a few vampires have
deviated from their Clan in noteworthy fashion. Most
such things can be simulated through simple roleplaying, or through Merits and Flaws (p. 479); for example,
while the childer of the mighty Hardestadt might all
display the same feeding restriction or obsessively focus on control, they do not differ significantly from
Ventrue as a whole. In a few cases, bloodlines actually
manifest different Disciplines or weaknesses; these are
noted in Chapter Ten.

Clans and Characters
Storytellers can choose to limit players’ selections of Clan. In a Camarilla city, for example, the vast majority of Kindred hail from
one of the seven founding Clans. While an
Assamite or Tzimisce can be worked into such
a chronicle, this requires some extra effort on
the Storyteller’s part, and we encourage Storytellers to be as open or restrictive with Clan
selection as they feel they need to be.

The Camarilla
Traditional Strongholds: Chicago, New Orleans,
Vienna, London, Paris
The Camarilla is also known as “The Ivory Tower,”
and the Sect lives up to that moniker. Created in the
15th century, the Camarilla was formed to preserve
and protect vampire society against the decimation
brought on by the Inquisition as well as the power drain
presented by the War of Princes during the Dark Ages.
The leaders of the Camarilla ruthlessly enforced the
Tradition of the Masquerade, elevating it to the Sect’s
highest law, a priority they continue to pursue even
in modern nights. These so-called “Kindred” seek to
maintain a quiet harmony between vampires and humanity — a goal constantly threatened by the Sabbat.
The Camarilla considers itself to be vampire society,
and there is some validity to their hubris. It is the largest Sect of Kindred, after all, and nearly any city on
the globe likely has some Camarilla presence. A Kindred who walks into a new city and looks for the local
vampire population will, more often than not, find a
Camarilla court. This expansiveness is partially due to
the fact that the Camarilla says that any vampire, regardless of Clan or bloodline, may go to a Prince and
claim membership in the Camarilla. It’s also partially
due to the fact that the Camarilla claims that all vampire society falls under its authority, regardless of what
other vampires believe. Many Kindred find it easier to
sit in the shadow of the Ivory Tower than debate the
point.
Over the centuries, the Camarilla has moved to
make good on its claims of global dominance, but with
limited success. Vampires are territorial by nature, and
there is a world of difference between a Prince supporting the idea that a Justicar claims total authority
over the globe and Archons showing up at the borders
of her domain and demanding total obedience. Elder
vampires who remember a time before Sects scoff at
what they see as “neonate audacity.” Still, the fires of
the Inquisition continue to burn in many elders’ memories, and many are willing to give up a few rights to
continue preserving the Masquerade and assure their
safety against mortal society.
Camarilla cities are not as cosmopolitan as the Sect
asserts. While Kindred of any lineage can claim membership, most come from the founding Clans of the Camarilla: the Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavians, Nosferatu,
Toreador, Tremere, and Ventrue. These Clans helped

38

to create the Camarilla, and they have a seat on the
Inner Circle (see p. 26). Vampires of other bloodlines
can attend conclave and meetings, but they are treated
as minority voices or simply ignored.
After the Sabbat formed, the Camarilla opposed
them as the only way to preserve and protect the Masquerade and its own Kindred. As the Sabbat threw
away the Traditions and all pretenses of humanity due
to their paranoia about Gehenna, the Ivory Tower
stood its ground and declared the Sabbat as enemies of
the Sect. Since then, the Camarilla has been in an alternating cold and hot war, trading territories like two
warring nations, and anyone who does not stand with
the Camarilla against the Sabbat may be considered to
be aiding the enemy.
As a result of this ongoing conflict with the Sabbat,
in modern nights the Ivory Tower is crumbling, losing
a few bricks here and there while it proudly proclaims
itself to be strong and whole. The elders cling to their
power bases, growing increasingly paranoid that other
Kindred are Sabbat infiltrators or Anarch sympathizers. Neonates feel more and more like serfs to the elder
nobility, asked to protect and uphold an organization
in which they have little hope of advancement but
plenty of opportunities for punishment. The ancillae
end up in the worst position: unable to break the glass
ceiling of elder dominance, but given enough scraps
of power to make the younger Kindred sharpen their
knives in jealousy.
The neonates and younger ancillae have an increasing advantage — modern technology. Elders find
themselves unable or unwilling to master the tools and
concepts of the modern nights: smartphones, tablet
computers, concealable body armor, portable weaponry, social networking. They fall further and further
behind in a world where even children know how
to blog and media becomes increasingly fragmented.
Some young Kindred co-opt these tools and use them
to further the preservation of the Masquerade, but others wonder why they can’t take the power that the elders so jealously guard — not only political power, but
the very blood in their veins through the foul act of
diablerie. Therefore, the elders increasingly lash out at
things they don’t understand, destroying loyal servant
and treacherous childer alike.
The enemies of the Camarilla have taken notice,
and bide their time.

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Practices
At the heart of the Camarilla lie the Traditions, and
at the heart of the Traditions lies the Prince. Whether
in name or deed, the Prince enforces the Traditions
within their domains and punishes those who violate
their law. Many Princes hold a regular court, which
function as a combination of social affair and legal proceeding. At court, vampires gossip, politick, and gain
favor with the Prince, and the Prince and his officers
handle matters of the law and render judgment or enact policies.
When a vampire is found guilty of high crimes (such
as an egregious breach of the Masquerade, the diablerie
of another Kindred, or offending the Prince), the Prince
can call for the Lextalionis – the dreaded blood hunt.
The Prince declares the hunt in his court, and the word
filters down through his Primogen to the Clans. All
who hear the call must participate (although “participation” can simply mean staying out of the way when
the hunters come through). Once in a while such a
hunt is called to hound the criminal Kindred into exile outside the city’s borders, but more often than not
the hunt only ends when the hunted suffers the Final
Death. Some Princes even turn a blind eye to the act
of Amaranth during such a hunt.
But not all legality centers around discipline and
punishment. The currency of the Camarilla (and many
other independent vampires that deal with the Camarilla) is a system of favors and debts. Such debts (or
“boons”) are not only given and incurred, but are also
traded between vampires in a healthy, invisible economy. The boon you owe to the Brujah Primogen might
ultimately be paid off to an elder of the Malkavian
Clan, so vampires are always careful about whom they
owe favors to. Because ignoring a boon can threaten
this entire economy, any hint of rebellion against the
system is met with an overwhelming response by the
Harpy and the rest of the local vampires.

Conclaves
Conclaves are the center of global Camarilla politics,
serving as the highest court of Camarilla legislation, a
high-level session of Sect-wide policy, and a political
rally all rolled into one. Only called by a Justicar, all
Kindred that the Camarilla claims authority over can
attend a conclave, and the proceedings can be over in
a few hours or stretch on for many weeks. Given the
open-door policy of conclaves, security is an issue, and
the location of a particular conclave might not be announced until a few days beforehand.

Generally, conclaves are called because of the actions of a powerful individual (such as a Prince) or due
to a serious breach of the Traditions, but once called,
any Kindred may bring a grievance to the conclave and
have it addressed. Entire domains have been reshaped
by conclaves: wars declared, blood hunts called, and
Princes politely encouraged to suddenly retire. The
Traditions are also interpreted here, and amendments
or precedents might be added. Princes might be given
emergency powers or special dispensation to deal with
particularly unruly problems (such as a local Sabbat infestation).
Not all conclaves are convened due to a problem,
however. Some Justicars schedule regular conclaves
to allow for more long-term policy discussions and to
handle less immediate but still pressing cases that have
accumulated over the year. Many Camarilla Kindred
use the opportunity to fraternize with others of their
position or lineage, and some view as a chance to blow
off some steam and party. Over the years, however, security has become tighter and tighter due to concerns
about the Camarilla’s enemies, and more and more
only key elders seem to be able to attend and have
their voices heard.

The View from Without
The Sabbat
The world has spun ever closer to Gehenna, and
these so-called “Kindred” are woefully unprepared for the final nights. They will be torn apart,

superiority.

They say they rule over all Kindred? The Romans
had something similar going, and things will end

The Sabbat

City, Montreal, Madrid

are certainly more overt with their acts of destruction
and elaborate games of terror.

Opposite the Camarilla stand the Sect of inhuman
vampires known as the Sabbat. Most of the vampiric
factions believe that the so-called “Sword of Caine”
is a collection of mindless barbarians and ultraviolent
fiends, or even demon worshippers bent on bringing
Satan to earth. As such, the Sabbat are vilified all
throughout vampire society.

Because of these tensions, the Sabbat is hardly a unified entity, and the Sect is home to numerous factions
of vampires united under the Sabbat’s banner. One of
the most feared is the Black Hand, a special militia hidden within the packs of the Sword of Caine. All members of the Black Hand bear a distinguishing mark — a
permanent, mystical sigil on the palms of their right
hands. Although this brand may be concealed or made
over, it may never be removed — once you’re in the
Hand, you’re a member until Final Death. The Sabbat
also has its own Inquisition, a small faction of Cainites
charged with rooting out heretics and infernalists. If
it labels someone as an infernalist, the accusation is
unlikely to be denied, and the faction uses torturous
tactics to gain the confessions it needs.

They’re right to fear the Sabbat, but not for those
reasons.
While the “Kindred” (a term the Sabbat despise)
of the Ivory Tower cower among mortals and cling to
outdated Traditions, the Sabbat prefer to indulge in
their vampiric nature. They refuse to wear the tattered
rags of humanity or to act as slaves and cattle to their
elders. Besides, vampires are clearly and openly superior to mortals — do humans lie down with cows and
call them brother? As such, Sabbat vampires consider
mortals to be tools and food at best, and have little tolerance for “Cainites” who pretend to be human. They
are inherently alien and literally inhumane.
But the Sword of Caine isn’t just a collection of gorestreaked psychotics running around shopping malls
with chainsaws. They reject humanity as a moral basis
for their lives, so they have turned to other alternatives.
They adhere to a wide variety of Paths of Enlightenment (see p. 313), philosophical tenets that force the
Beast into a narrow channel and allow the Cainite to
maintain a day-to-day existence that resembles stability (if not sanity). Further, the Sabbat not only rebel
against morality, but also against their own inclinations towards solitude. They frequently join together
into packs that act as one part religious cult, one part
political faction, and one part combat unit.
Between moral devotion, pack loyalty, and the need
to rebel, Sabbat cities are devoid of the calm, quiet society of the Camarilla court. Tensions are always high
in Sabbat “dioceses,” and the Cainite’s surroundings often reflect their explosive natures. In cities controlled
by Sabbat, murder, robberies, rape, and assault are commonplace. The Sword of Caine threatens every city it
possesses, insinuating itself into urban landscapes until
they become nothing but raw resources for the eternal
crusade. Although the Sabbat might not be any more
“evil” than some of the elders of the Camarilla, they

40

The Loyalist faction believes that it is the “true”
Sabbat, claiming that each vampire is his own master.
They preach that the freedom to do whatever you want
belongs to all vampires, and they tend to act against
their leaders’ orders just because they feel they should.
There is also the Status Quo faction, who accepts the
nature of vampires and knows that shaking the foundations of the Sabbat serves only to distract it from its
greater goal. The Moderates oppose the encroachment
of rules and guidelines that have no place among such
creatures as vampires, resting between Loyalist dogma
and Status Quo conservatism. Finally, the eldest members of the Sabbat belong to the Ultra-Conservatives,
those who favor centralization and authoritarianism in
order to turn the Sabbat into a military force against
the Antediluvians and the Camarilla.
The thread that holds the Sabbat together is a religious zeal to tear down the Antediluvians. When packs
or ideologies threaten to explode into all-out civil war,
the Sabbat manage to pull together around their common hatred for the Camarilla (who they view as puppets of the Antediluvians). The entire Sect claims that
Gehenna is coming, and that they must prepare for
those end times when the Antediluvians awake and
destroy the world. When the time comes, the Sword of
Caine will save the world and take their rightful places
as the vampiric lords of the night.
And the Sabbat has proven to be a serious threat to
the Camarilla. Neonates disgusted with staring at the
same elders every night dangling power eternally out

of their reach have openly joined the Sabbat. Every
Prince grows increasingly terrified that one night the
Sabbat will show up in his Elysium and murder him.
Various cities that have stood as Camarilla strongholds for years are contested or have fallen into Sabbat control. As the nights roll on, the Camarilla has
been forced into harsh measures, killing vampires with
known (or even suspected) Sabbat affiliation outright.
Some Kindred use this increasingly hard-line stance to
help remove rivals or better themselves in the eyes of
their sires, but for every Sabbat Cainite killed, more
join their ranks.

Practices
Everything in the Sabbat points back to two key
(and often conflicting) principles: freedom and loyalty.
Their set of laws, the Code of Milan (see p. 41), reinforces these two points. Cainites are free to do what
they wish, but they must always remain loyal to the
Sword, because only the Sect can protect free vampires
from manipulative elders, especially the Antediluvians. Two of the most influential Clans of the Sect, the
Lasombra and the Tzimisce, are believed to have destroyed their Antediluvian progenitors and diablerized
them, setting the example for the other Sabbat vampire Clans to follow.
But principles and fervor don’t always hold the Beast
at bay. Just like the Camarilla, the Sect contains its
own rivalries and political maneuvers, as well as religious and philosophical conflicts that can become just
as bloody. These conflicts constantly tear at the Sword,
often setting them back from their goals as much (or
more) than their enemies do. Although the Sect has
organization and structure, each Cainite has too many
conflicting loyalties to support a rigid structure. The
Sabbat is constantly struggling against itself, only coming together when an enemy appears.
The core of the Sabbat is the pack, a collection of
vampires bound by Vinculum (p. 288) and common
interest. Packs are such an integral part of Sabbat society that Cainites without a pack are often viewed with
suspicion and distrust. Each pack usually fights within
itself until some authority rises to the top, such as a
priest to conduct rituals and a Ductus to lead in secular
matters. Higher positions exist (see p. 27), but unlike
the Camarilla where all power stems from the Prince,
in the Sabbat positions tend to build upon the packs.
Some dioceses forego higher positions entirely, choosing to have the packs manage and police themselves
(often with very mixed results).

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Outside of the Lasombra and Tzimisce, most Sabbat
vampires consider themselves to be the “anti-Clans” or
antitribu of their parent Clans. Some pervert the expectations of their Clans, while others take the core ideas
of their lineage to their most monstrous extreme. A few
have even become new bloodlines, manifesting different Disciplines because of their place within the Sabbat. (Antitribu are covered in Chapter Ten, p. 428.)

allow Cainites to blow off some steam and reconnect
with other vampires before heading back down a road
towards mistrust and internal conflict. The goal of these
rituals is not only to help create solidarity among Sabbat vampires, but also to push the boundaries of their
vampiric bodies and test their capabilities for war.
Some example ritae are available in the Appendix
(p. 507).

Rituals
Unless they are hasty war-time “shovelheads” that
are Embraced, hit over the head with a shovel, and
forced to dig their way out of their own grave, most
Sabbat vampires go through Creation Rites designed
to prove themselves True Sabbat. The rite forces the
vampire to prove himself to his new sire or pack, often
in a way that strips away much of his Humanity, turning the fledgling from a weak, pathetic human into a
proper monster worth of the Sect.
Out of mockery of human religious belief, many of
the rituals (or “ritae”) and conventions of the Sabbat
are perversions of those of the Catholic Church. One
of the most notable is the Vaulderie (p. 288), a corruption of the Eucharist in which Cainites pour their
blood into a chalice and then each drinks the commingled vitae in order to strengthen their loyalty to each
other. They also participate in a wide variety of other
rituals. Fire, blood, and violence are common themes
in their “ritae,” and the rituals involved range from fire
dances to ceremonial killing to the corruption of existing games and sports into excuses for violent, bloody
slaughter. Their unlives are tense and hostile, and ritae

The Anarch Movement
Traditional Strongholds: Los Angeles, San Diego,
San Francisco
Nominally a faction within the Camarilla, most “Anarchs” are still under the authority of the Ivory Tower.
The Camarilla would say that the Anarchs are under
the protection of the Sect, while the Anarchs would
likely call it oppression. Still, many in the Anarch
Movement understand the usefulness of the structure,
with only the most radical calling for total withdrawal
from the Camarilla. The Anarchs seek to change the
Ivory Tower from within, turning it into the benevolent Kindred society it so often claims to be.
What needs to change? Ask twelve Anarchs, and
you’ll get thirteen different answers. They agree that
change needs to happen, but they aren’t collectively
committed to any particular plan. Common threads
pop up, such as the redistribution of power from the
elders to all vampires, and for political authority to be
based on merit rather than age. Whether those changes come through passionate debate in Elysium or guerrilla action against specific elders, however, depends on
the Anarch in question. Unlike the Sabbat who rebel
because vampires should be superior, the Movement’s
goals are at least nominally egalitarian.
Naturally, it’s that very sense of equality that makes
the Anarch Movement so dangerous to vampire society. This resistance to change isn’t unique to the Camarilla; elders in the Sabbat or the independent Clans
have just as little desire to relinquish their power, and
ancillae have worked equally hard to be next in line for
the elders’ station. If the Anarch rhetoric takes hold,
all that work will have been for nothing. So it’s not
surprising that Anarchs spend much of their time frustrated, and they tend to adopt a siege mentality.
Despite their integration within the Camarilla, the
Anarch Movement is essentially a Sect, although they
don’t have the level of organization that would keep
them from being on the same level as the Camarilla,
Sabbat, or the independent Clans. The only thing that
unifies them is that they know what they don’t want to
be. That’s helpful as a rallying call, but doesn’t work
well as an organizational chart. Moreover, structure
quickly leads to stagnation, and that’s exactly what the
Anarchs are against.

44

That doesn’t meant that Anarchs are against organization, however. Despite their name, not all Anarchs
are actually anarchists; many seek to change the Camarilla or the Sabbat into some sort of new structure,
usually based on mortal governmental ideas. Most of
these structures tend to revolve around some form of
democracy, but variations of neo-feudalism and even
fascism have been tried (with varying success) throughout the Movement. One of the few things that Anarchs
seem to agree on is that at some point there needs to
be someone at the top, and that vampire is commonly
called the Baron (p. 25).
But it’s only been recently that the Anarchs have
been able to have any kind of common identity. After
the Second Anarch Revolt in 1944 that led to the creation of the Anarch Free State in California, the Revolutionary Council decided to adopt a set of principles
of self-governance for the Free State before dissolving
itself — the “Status Perfectus,” or “The Perfect State.”
This was a revolutionary document, the first to state
the Anarch dream clearly and unequivocally in modern times. It called on Anarchs everywhere to protect
one another, regardless of Clan affiliation. It promised
a Kindred nation free of political oppression and elder
prejudice, and swore to extend that freedom to all Kindred everywhere. They declared that free will, or “libertas,” is an inherent part of Kindred spiritual nature,
and that all vampires must work to free themselves
from the forces that would rob them of their libertas.
Some Anarchs disagree with parts or the whole of the
Status Perfectus, but it has proved to be a massively influential document for the Movement, and the closest
the Sect has had to a unifying set of principles.
Regardless, what the Anarchs lack in organization,
they more than make up in passion. From the most
in-your-face angry neonate punk to the most eloquent
and soft-spoken intellectual, Anarchs are collectively
driven, which provides a momentum that most Kindred simply aren’t used to. Even more terrifying to
most vampires, the Anarchs appear to actually believe
in what they say. Elders try to pass it off as naiveté or
inexperience with the Jyhad, but these young vampires
seem to accomplish things that centuries of manipulation and power couldn’t do. And change terrifies those
in power.

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

The Anarch Revolt from centuries ago is flaring back
up in the modern nights, and many Anarchs think the
time has come for them to take the night back.

Practices
Some Kindred mistakenly think of the Anarch
Movement as just a collection of newly-Embraced
Brujah raging against their betters. They are often surprised to learn just how cosmopolitan the Sect really
is. For every loud, brash neonate that wants to tear
everything down, there’s a sober, thoughtful ancilla
committed to the Movement’s ideals. The Anarchs
wouldn’t have lasted as long as they have if they were
all rebels without a clue, or if they were only a handful
of Clans wrapped up in their passions. Diversity, the
very thing that causes such disorganization, is also one
of the greatest strengths of the Movement.
Unfortunately vampires often default to establishing dominance among themselves, and such a diverse
collection of Cainites needs something to help show
the pecking order. For Kindred bent on proving that
merit should be the guiding principle of vampire governance, status is not only an incompatible concept, but
actively offensive to some Anarchs. Instead, Anarchs
rely on whether they have personally heard of another
Anarch, instead of what some other vampire said was
important. As a result, the Status Background for Anarchs relies on reputation: a combination of self-promotion, word-of-mouth, and outright braggadocio that
gets the Anarch recognized both inside and out of his
own barony. It doesn’t correspond to a political title or
a measure of authority — there are untitled vampires
(such as the notorious prankster Smiling Jack) with a
universally higher reputation than Kindred who claim
the title of Baron. Whether this recognition confers respect or disdain is a secondary concern; as Oscar Wilde
said, “There is only one thing in life worse than being
talked about, and that is not being talked about.”

manity while Camarilla cynics believe it to be the folly
of youth, but the Anarchs don’t care. They frequently
play games and pull pranks on each other (and on other unsuspecting Kindred), both as tests of courage and
as a way to blow off some steam.
Some Anarchs disapprove of the games and the
pranks. They say it brings down the level of the discourse. They say it makes it harder for the Movement
to be taken seriously. They say that these games and
pranks are dangerous, and that they threaten the Masquerade. Worst of all, they say that they’re all just a
waste of time, time better suited for bringing about
the glorious revolution of vampire society. And sure,
playing tag with 9mm pistols is pretty dangerous, even
if you tell everyone not to aim for the head. Baiting
elders in Elysium into frenzy probably is making it
harder for the Baron to conduct his debate with the
local Prince. Staging accidents and pretending to be a
corpse around a mortal likely is a hair away from breaking the Masquerade.
But the young Anarchs say “Fuck it; eternity’s too
short.” And so the games continue.

The View from Without
The Camarilla
They, at least, understand that their place is
within the Ivory Tower, but their destabilizing
influence can be a problem. Best to keep them
quiet, one way or another.
The Sabbat
They have the right idea, but they aren’t willing to
give up their comfortable Humanity in order to go
to the next step. There’s some potential recruitment material there, but they break easy.

Games and Pranks

The Independents

Unlike the blood-splattered games that the Sabbat
use as part of their ritae or the forced civility of Elysium, the Anarchs genuinely like to have fun and joke
with each other. They believe that Kindred existence
shouldn’t be all backstabbing and bloodletting, but
rather about enjoying each night to the fullest. Sabbat
fiends consider this idea to be a disgusting show of hu-

We should all hold hands and be brothers?
Hardly, young Cainite. My Clan had fought hard
to stay outside of your Jyhad, and I will not give it
up because you tell me I am not fair.

The Independents
Traditional Strongholds: Alamut (Assamites),
Cairo (Followers of Set), Venice (Giovanni), Kolkata
(Ravnos)
Over the past few centuries, the fatal dance between
the Camarilla and the Sabbat has changed vampire society. Their bloody Jyhad has shaped the secret history
of the world, destroying millions of mortal lives in the
process. However, there are some Clans who witness
both Sects tear at each other’s throats in the name of
their ancient feud and decide that they would prefer to
watch from the sidelines.
These four lineages can claim their place as proper
Clans, but share a strong disinterest in getting involved
in the war between the Camarilla and the Sabbat.
Granted, individual members of these Clans (usually
younger Kindred) show up in the ranks of both Sects
from time to time, but the elders of the independent
Clans have their own goals in mind, goals that would
conflict with allegiance or loyalty to a Sect.
Of course, independent Kindred are vampires first and
Clan members second; they don’t all possess mindless,
unwavering devotion to the ideals of their Clan. Most
of them focus on their personal goals first, whether or
not they coincide with their Clan’s goals. This has the
side-benefit of confusing outside Kindred even more,
since it’s never clear whether a particular independent
will act with their Clan’s interests in mind, their personal interests, or some hybrid of the two. (She may
even pretend to serve one set of interests while secretly
serving another). Individual independents are always
wildcards, with no set of laws or politics forcing them
into a clear, defined path.
At least, that’s the outside perspective.
It’s believed that the elders of the independent Clans
are active in greater numbers than those that dominate the Sects. One Clan has an Antediluvian that has
been actively assisting their goals for centuries. Another seems to benefit from murdering other Kindred.
The terrifying Methuselahs of a third are rumored to be
waking and possibly organizing their childer for some
terrible purpose. As for the fourth….
Regardless of the rumors, the independents continue
as if nothing is wrong, working with and against their
Clans in the same measure as any Sect vampire. If they
are indeed the pawns of their ancient masters, they act
as if they are ignorant of it.

46

The Clans
The independent Clans have almost nothing in
common except their unwillingness to join a Sect en
masse. Each Clan has a different role in the Jyhad, and
each pursues its own goals. Standing apart even from
each other, they keep their own laws outside of those
of the Sects.

The Assamites
The Assamites (who call themselves the Children of
Haqim) are a Clan of murderous vampires. For many
years they acted as independent assassins, contracted
by the Sects (or anyone who gave them blood) to murder targets. Of all the independents, the Assamites are
the most feared, both for their role as assassins and the
rumors of their thirst for the blood of elders.
Although they have traditionally acted as mercenary
assassins, in the modern nights some of the Children of
Haqim question whether an allegiance with one of the
Sects might not be more beneficial for them. Ultimately, however, most Assamites follow the will and the
orders of Alamut, their ancestral stronghold, as well as
their own internal laws, known collectively as the Laws
of Haqim. The most loyal of the Assamites believe that
other vampires are a plague that needs to be exterminated, while others claim that individual Kindred need
to be judged (and perhaps killed) based on their own
sins, not merely because they are vampires.
For more on the Assamites, see p. 48.

The Followers of Set
The Followers of Set have different reasons for refusing to join a Sect. They consider themselves to be part
of something much older than either the Camarilla or
the Sabbat, and dismiss the idea that goals established
since antiquity should be cast aside merely because
some vampires started calling themselves by a new
name a few centuries ago. They claim that their faith
dates back to the very start of civilization, and that this
ancient trust is far more important than politics.
That doesn’t mean that the Setites aren’t above
playing the mercenary between the Sects. Their Clan
lives and worships in secret places, and this gives them
access to dark favors and a wealth of knowledge that
they can offer to any vampire willing to pay the right
price. Many Kindred know the trap that dealing with
the Setites entails, and yet time and again Cainites

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

come to them, each time swearing that it will be the
last. Each favor traded or addiction fulfilled brings the
Setites one step closer to their ultimate goal: the resurrection of Set himself.
For more on the Followers of Set, see p. 52.

The Giovanni
The Giovanni are a Clan in multiple senses — not
only do they share common vampiric blood, but most of
their new Embraces come from the mortal descendants
of other Clan members as well. The Necromancers are
known to pursue two goals — learning the secrets of
the dead and acquiring mortal power and wealth —
both of which help their Clan as a whole. Only a few
trusted elders know that their founder, Augustus Giovanni, seeks to use the knowledge and power of the
Clan to destroy the Shroud that separates the realm of
the dead from this world.
As such, the Giovanni don’t have any need for
Sects. They survived the past several centuries all on
their own; they don’t need protection from the mortals through any flimsy Masquerade. They have their
own family to act as allies, resources, and internal enforcement, so they don’t need help. What can membership in a Sect give to them that they can’t already
get through deals, trading, and occasional espionage?
They have a Promise that keeps them from interfering in the affairs of the Camarilla (and vice versa), but
overall the Giovanni are extremely self-sufficient and
stand totally outside the authority of the Sects. That,
combined with their mastery of Necromancy, makes
many vampires very, very nervous.
For more on the Giovanni, see p. 56.

The Ravnos
The Ravnos are masters of illusion, compelled by
their blood to indulge in vice. Their primary allegiance
is to themselves, though some consider their Clan to
be almost as important. Compared to the other independent Clans they are very loosely organized: partially
due to their diaspora all over the world, and partially
due to a very un-vampire like wanderlust that pervades
the Ravnos. They travel to Camarilla and Sabbat cit-

ies alike, where most Princes and Archbishops have
learned that it is better to let them pass through than
to deal with the headaches that come from trying to
prevent them from entering.
As such, the Ravnos are completely indifferent to the
politics of the Sects, or indeed to politics of any kind.
Many outside observers consider the Ravnos to be too
chaotic to have a meaningful impact on the Jyhad as a
whole – and the Ravnos nod their heads and continue
doing what they want. The Clan believes that one
day their Clan founder will awaken and destroy all of
the other Antediluvians. Until that day, they wander
without allegiance, and see no reason to change.
For more on the Ravnos, see p. 64.

The View from Without
The Camarilla
They are clearly up to something. A trickle of
these “independent” Kindred end up joining the
Ivory Tower, but too many more do as they will,
with no laws or society to contain them. They
cannot stand up to us on their own, but they are
powerful enough to shift the balance of things.
The Sabbat
These Clans claim that they’re free? Bullshit.
They’re just as much the puppets of the Antediluvians as the Camarilla. No point trying to kill a
Giovanni in his mansion or a Setite in his temple,
but when the world ends, they’ll fall just like
everyone else.
The Anarchs
These guys get it. They can stand outside the
Jyhad, make their own plans, and people listen.
That’s freedom, man. Too bad I can’t trust any
of these fuckers as far as I could throw them.

The childer of Haqim, known as Assamites to the
rest of the Kindred, are a silent knife in the dark, an
order of bloodthirsty assassins who participate in the
secret wars of the undead by operating as killers for
hire. Outside the purview of the Sects, the Assamites
are true independents and mercenaries, hiring out to
whoever can pay their blood-price and ungoverned by
the will of Prince or Priscus. By the time a mark realizes
that he’s being hunted by an Assamite, it’s often far too
late. Needless to say, this makes the Assamites both
feared and reviled by many of the other Clans.
In truth, the Assamites are more than simple thugs
and killers. Theirs is a complex but insular Clan predicated upon the three principles of wisdom, sorcery, and
diablerie. Most Assamites that other vampires encounter
are members of the warrior caste, however, so Kindred
society has painted them all with that brush. For their
part, the Assassins have done nothing to stop this misunderstanding. If it helps them acquire contracts and it occludes the true nature of their Clan, the better for them.

Appearance: Older Assamites often come from Middle
Eastern and North African cultures, though more and
more young Assamites come from a wider demographic. In traditional
environments, the Assamites prefer garb
appropriate to religious or Clan custom.
When in public, however, Assamites wear
whatever the locals
do, allowing them to
fulfill their contracts
without anyone noticing anything
amiss. An

Long ago, the Assamites were brought to heel by a
powerful curse to curb their bloodlust, levied by the
Tremere at the behest of the Camarilla. They cannot
taste the vitae of vampires without it causing them
harm. In their ongoing quest to lower their Generation
and bring themselves closer to their holy figure, Haqim
(whom some outside scholars claim was of the Second
Generation, while others insist he was a judge appointed by the other Antediluvians), the Assamites must refine the blood of Kindred into an alchemical solution.
Were it not for this mystical yoke, the Assamites would
surely be unchecked on a crusade of unholy diablerie.
Nickname: Assassins
Sect: For the most part, the Assamites tend to be
independent, letting the Sects hire them to operate on
their own terms. That said, some Assamites believe an
allegiance with the Camarilla or the Sabbat would allow the entire Clan to stand more strongly.

48

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Assamite’s skin grows darker with age (as opposed to other vampires, whose skin gets paler); particularly ancient
Assamites are almost ebony in complexion.
Haven: Assamites often share communal havens
with others of their local cell, remote structures that
allow the Assassins to watch the larger domain from a
distance. These havens are generally well appointed,
but not so lavish that the whole place can’t be moved
on short notice. Individual Assamites also tend to keep
personal hideouts of a much more humble nature, for
when they need a place to lay low.
Background: Those Embraced into Clan Assamite tend
to fall into two distinct types: The “provincial” members of
the Clan fit whatever their locality is, and can blend seamlessly in with the people around them. The higher-profile
“jet-setters” transcend cultures, bolstered by their ability
to handle interpersonal and intellectual challenges.
Character Creation: Physical Attributes tend to be
primary, with some Assamites favoring Social Attributes to help them get close to their prey. Talents and
Skills are equally favored, but Knowledges may help
the wise Assamite in a pinch. Few Assassins cultivate
extensive Backgrounds, and instead specialize in an
array of Disciplines that heighten their competence.
The most accomplished Assamites follow the Clan’s
unique Path of Enlightenment, and those who don’t
often have to spend a great deal of effort maintaining
their Virtues and Humanity.
Clan Disciplines: Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus
Weaknesses: Due to the Tremere blood-curse,
should an Assamite consume the blood of another
Kindred, she suffers one automatic level of unsoakable lethal damage per blood point imbibed. Diablerie
attempts result in automatic aggravated damage, one
health level per point of permanent Willpower the victim possesses; the would-be diablerist gains no benefits
(including Generation reduction) if he survives the
process. In addition, Assamites must tithe some of the
profits from their contracts to their sires or superiors
(generally around 10 percent of all such earnings).
Organization: An insular, hierarchical organization shapes
much of Assamite custom. “The Old Man on the Mountain”
— the master assassin who makes his haven in the mountain fortress of Alamut — is the ultimate authority, and the
Clan heeds the orders that trickle down to them with a mix

of reverence and terror. Individual and local cells of Assamites known as falaqi frequently have license to act with
autonomy, but “turncoats” against the higher cause are rare.

Stereotypes
Brujah: Where they are blatant, we are subtle.
And that is why they are a broken Clan and we are
ascendant.
Followers of Set: Humility before God is itself divine,
but certainly not humility before their unclean god.
Gangrel: When the blade bites deeply, they die as
readily as all other Kindred.
Giovanni: They value their independence as we do,
but they squander it in unholy debauchery.
Lasombra: For all their posturing, they are quick to
pay our fees and hire our knives.
Malkavian: In the parable of the scorpion and the
frog, they play the roles of both doomed creatures.
Nosferatu: But for their desperation to be included
among the society that shuns them, they would make
puissant rafiq.
Ravnos: Make yourself known to them and they will
acknowledge their place.
Toreador: We kill to honor our God. They kill to
avenge a wittier remark.
Tremere: Possessing the power of Solomon makes
them none the wiser for it, and vengeance will be ours.
Tzimisce: They bear old grudges against us; meet
them with a wary eye.
Ventrue: Vultures picking at the corpse of a longgone nobility.
Caitiff: Every culture must have its Judas goat.
Camarilla: A tower built in Babel by Icarus.
Sabbat: They profane what is holy and pretend it is
an eminent glory.
Anarchs: The wisest of the tribes — because they
know when to admit they don’t know.

Quote: Your blood is anathema to me, but the act of spilling it brings me closer to Haqim.

The legacy of the Brujah is one of halcyon greatness
marred by their own fiery natures. Theirs was the glory
of ancient Carthage, but Ventrue treachery in ancient
Rome brought the dream to an end. Since then, the
Brujah have borne a grudge.
Tonight, the Brujah
are rebels and
provocateurs,
bat-swinging
hooligans and

agents of change in a society long crippled by stasis. As
rebels, it’s in their nature to challenge the status quo —
though sometimes, without adequate opposition, they
embody the status quo themselves. It works out fine,
because there’s always a hot-blooded Brujah waiting in
the wings to bring down an uppity Clanmate grown
too comfortable in the role of rebel-turned-dictator.
More so than any other Clan, the Brujah still feel the
flames of the passions that once inspired them as mortals.
Clan Brujah loves a cause and is quick to act on a stirring
speech, accusation of injustice, or a call to arms. This
connection to passion can be a blessing, but inspiration
can also yield to the madness and hunger of the Beast.
No wise Prince turns his back on the Brujah, and rare
is the Brujah who would allow herself to be manipulated
or pandered to. A Brujah is her own master, first and
foremost, and those who would bring her to heel face a
terrible task. A Brujah who thinks she’s getting the
short end of the stick will tear an enemy to ribbons
first and maybe remember to ask questions later, no
matter if he’s a Primogen or a mortal authority.
Some Kindred historians claim that the Brujah
have parlayed their ancient betrayal into a role
as agitators against the very order that they help
support. Others claim the Brujah have long since
submitted to the will of that same order, being
little more than loyal opposition rendered impotent. Most Brujah don’t care either way, as long
as someone needs a good ass-kicking and they
can be the ones to deliver it.
Nickname: Rabble
Sect: For all its rebellion, Clan
Brujah generally considers itself a member of the Camarilla. Young Rabble sometimes
look to the
wildness of
the Sabbat,
but elders

50

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

assert that the Ivory Tower provides a fine structure
against which to rage.
Appearance: Many Brujah affect styles and mannerisms that reflect an attitude of rebellion. Multicolored
hair, shaven heads, spikes, rivets, fetish gear, and t-shirts
with bold slogans might appeal to a Brujah. While not
every Brujah wears the “uniform,” the Rabble often enjoy
adorning themselves in outfits intended to provoke. Some
young Brujah prefer mobile devices as their tools of resistance, and can summon a riot at the touch of a screen.

tear it all down, while Idealists enjoy solving problems
through theory. This last harkens somewhat to the classical roots of the Brujah as philosopher-kings, and most Idealists are among the ranks of Brujah ancillae and elders.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Fast, invisible, fanatical, and they
want to drink my fucking blood? Sounds like a
good case for doing unto others.

Haven: Brujah may feel kinship to a city, but they rarely develop such ties to individual locations. Thus, at any
given time, a Brujah probably has a half-dozen or more
hideouts, safehouses, and flats available. These are often
shabby and ill-kept until the Brujah needs them. Brujah
havens might also have mortals who follow the Brujah’s
ideology or his cult of personality. This works out fine: It
never hurts to have a spare vessel in an emergency.

Followers of Set: The apple doesn’t fall far
from the tree, and the tree should have been
chopped down long ago.

Background: As creatures of passion, Brujah often
Embrace without really thinking much about it, and
their childer tend to be a disparate lot. Sometimes, the
Rabble Embrace those who share a similar outlook or
enthusiasm for a cause as the prospective sire. Other
times, they inflict the Embrace on those of opposite ideology, cursing a rival with vampirism as punishment.

Lasombra: No habla Ventrue with a different hat on.

Character Creation: Brujah are usually — though
not exclusively — drawn from mortals with violent
or ungovernable personalities. Their Natures and Demeanors are often similar, as Brujah have little use for
guile. They lean toward physical Attributes, with Social and Mental about equal afterwards. Many favor
Skills and Talents, but most respect the Knowledges
that make them more than just thugs. Contacts, Allies,
and Herd are common Backgrounds.

Toreador: If you can catch one, see if he’ll blow
you. They might as well be good for something.

Clan Disciplines: Celerity, Potence, Presence

Gangrel: Much respect, so long as we agree it’s
mutual.
Giovanni: If you have to deal with one of these
nasty dagos, you’ve already lost.
Malkavian: Trust one? No. Find some common
ground with one? Maybe.
Nosferatu: It’s better to have one telling you shit about
someone else than the other way around, so be cool.
Ravnos: I’ll bet I can throw one further than you can.

Tremere: If one of these witches starts looking at
you weird, you’d better hope you can get close to
him before your blood catches on fire.
Tzimisce: Nasty old bats with claws where their
junk used to be. But at least they’re usually honest.
Ventrue: Boot, meet face.

Weaknesses: The same passions that inspire Brujah to greatness or depravity, left unchecked, can send
them into incandescent rages: The difficulties of rolls
to resist or guide frenzy (p. 298) are two higher than
normal. Additionally, a Brujah may never spend Willpower to avoid frenzy, though he may spend a point of
Willpower to end a frenzy that has already begun.

Caitiff: Teach them something and maybe they’ll
return the favor.

Organization: Certain causes rise and fall in Brujah
fashion, but some of the more tenured are those who call
themselves Idealists and Iconoclasts. Iconoclasts want to

Anarchs: Get on the bus and let’s tear this
Prince a new asshole together.

Camarilla: It mostly works when we punch it
into heading the right direction.
Sabbat: Giving your soul to the devil makes you
a servant, you choads.

Quote: I’ll give you a head start. You’re the tortoise and I’m the hare —
a pissed-off, fuck-the-world hare with a score to settle and a thirst like the devil’s own.

Addiction, debasement, corruption, and desperation
strike fear into many Kindred who worry that theirs
will become an unlife of ruin, but to the Followers of
Set, these and more are the tools of
the trade. Pimps, pushers, and
priests, the Setites cater to
the needs of the desperate,
and convert them to a nihilistic cause in doing
so. Whether one needs
flesh, money, drugs, or
dark secrets, the Followers of Set can provide it, and when
they do so,

they all but guarantee themselves a return visit from
those who seek them.
The Followers of Set are as much a chthonic religion as they are a Clan, though the faith includes the
Clan. Its mythology is complex and convoluted, an impenetrable pantheon of god-monsters. At the apex of
this worship stands a syncretism of the Egyptian Lord
of the Underworld Set and the Greek hydra Typhon,
as much spiritual guardians of secret places as they are
the “liberators” of other’s souls. To outsiders, this is all
blasphemous religious affectation, but to devout Setites, the cult and cause are real, and their dark lord
works his will through them.
Needless to say, the politics of desperation and the
placation of evil gods place the Serpents on the outside
of Kindred society. The Setites are fine with this. The
Kindred can often find themselves in need of what
the Followers of Set purvey, and the extra “service”
of secrecy is one the Setites are happy to provide —
at a premium. The Setites offer a devil’s deal, but
on their own terms. That way, when they collect
their due and feed blood and souls into the maw of
the Typhonic beast, all of its sacrifices have been
given willingly.
Nickname: Setites, Serpents
Sect: Externally, none of the Sects will have
the Followers of Set. Internally, the Setites
sometimes describe themselves in terms of
both Sect and Clan. They have no real impetus to join either the Camarilla or Sabbat,
and their goals are different from those of the
Anarchs.
Appearance: Many older Setites hail from the
North African and Mediterranean ethnicities native to
the Serpents’ historical territory, but they freely Embrace from among the mortals of their adopted homes.
Some long-standing Setite temples are tied to locations where “Egyptian” Serpents might seem out of
place, but where some aspect of serpent mythology is

present, as in Mesoamerica or even far-flung Nordic locales, and thus draw their membership from local populations. Red hair is considered a mark of Set’s favor.
Haven: Where their hidden temples stand, the Setites make their havens, either individually or communally. These may be anything from “churches” with
never-before-heard-of denominations or they may be
outright cults that have to hide their existences. The
secretive Serpents sometimes hide individual havens
in places where other Kindred don’t often go, such as
insular ethnic neighborhoods, abandoned domains,
“the rough part of town,” and so forth. Some Setites
also haven in secret mystical places that have value to
the Clan, guarding them from outsiders.

rible Methuselah who claims to be the childe of Set
himself at the head. If this is true, then the Clan’s
higher agenda probably originates here, but the Setites
themselves remain silent on the topic.

Stereotypes
Assamite: They aren’t so different from us, and it
scares the hell out of them.
Brujah: We could have saved their precious
Carthage, but in their pride, they chose an eternity of
ridicule and failure.
Gangrel: Don’t mistake their sullenness for noble
savagery. They have vices, just like anyone else.

Background: Prospective childer for the Followers of
Set often spend some time involved with a Setite cult,
so they’re indoctrinated in the mysteries of the Clan
before becoming one of its Kindred. They may come
from any cultural origin, though many are outsiders,
loners, or otherwise marginalized by society, which is
often what led them to the forbidden fruits offered by
the cult of Set in the first place.

Giovanni: They distract themselves with methods
and neglect their goals.

Character Creation: Sires choose those who demonstrate acumen in Social and Mental Attributes, as the
Clan needs its proselytizers and its priests to be charismatic
and quick-witted. Knowledges are almost always primary,
though Talents may be so instead, especially among those
Serpents engaged in dealings with others. Setites focus
on Backgrounds that give influence over others whether
subtly or overtly, making Allies, Contacts, Influence, Resources, and sometimes Retainers popular.

Nosferatu: Forge a relationship or you’ll find yourself dragged before a Prince or Archbishop with them
as witnesses.

Clan Disciplines: Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis
Weaknesses: Given their origins in darkness, the Serpents react negatively to bright light: Add two health
levels to damage caused by exposure to sunlight. Setites
also lose one die from dice pools for actions taken in
bright light (police spotlights, stage lights, flares, etc.).
Organization: Setite organization is mostly local,
with a single temple or network of cults representing
a city’s Serpent presence. Setites in the cities rarely
scheme among each other, preferring to face outward
threats in unity rather than the schismatic self-interest
of the Sects. Whispers persist of a massive temple devoted to Set located somewhere in Africa, with a ter-

Lasombra: Behind many successful Lasombra is a
debt to the temple.
Malkavian: They make excellent allies because no
one pays attention to them, and by the time they’re
due their share, all they can do is gibber.

Ravnos: Sorry, I don’t take credit. From you.
Toreador: Cha-ching.
Tremere: One in a hundred realizes what we might
do together. The rest are up their own asses.
Tzimisce: The Dragon is not the only Serpent
among the Damned.
Ventrue: Let them hate us publicly, so long as they
keep buying.
Caitiff: How easily the trod-upon becomes a convert.
Camarilla: Hypocrisy is great for business.
Sabbat: Take one step forward, two steps back, set
self on fire, kick own ass. Preen.
Anarchs: An idealistic cult of personality that sometime succeeds in spite of itself.

Quote: I know what you need.

A glint of red eyes in the darkness, the scent of a
predator’s musk, a flash of fangs, the sound of flesh
tearing: These mark the presence of the Gangrel. More
than any other Clan, the Gangrel resemble the beasts
associated with the legends of vampires: bats, wolves,
and other creatures of darkness. Indeed, the Outlanders may develop the ability to transform themselves
into these and other, more primal forms.
The Gangrel have other characteristics in common with
animals as well. Many shun the elaborate social constructs
of both Kindred and kine. A number of them prefer to
move alone or as a member of small packs or coteries. Most
are tough and, when pressed, ferocious. And when Gangrel succumb to the depredations of the Beast, they are left
with some feature redolent of the animal kingdom.
As a Clan, the Gangrel are wary and aloof. Most would
prefer to spend their nights stalking prey or wilding on
the rooftops than minding Princely edicts or lobbying
for recognition of domain. Theirs is a tense relationship
with vampire society, and Outlanders are among the
most frequent to turn Anarch or Autarkis. In some
localities, the Gangrel have collectively abandoned
membership in any Sect — insofar as the Gangrel
truly ever do anything collectively.

that political games and social structures do nothing
for the primal Gangrel.
Appearance: Personal presentation is often not high
on the list of many Gangrel priorities, and a Gangrel’s
appearance is often more
a matter of circumstance than it is of
active decision.
The Clan’s weakness can contribute a great deal to
their appearance,
as does an extended unlife in the
places where
they make
their

The Jyhad seems less pronounced among
the Gangrel than it is among other Clans, and
the Outlanders have little regard for the eternal conflict. Differences between Gangrel more
often fall along the lines of domain and feeding rights
than they do on generational mistrust, and the things
that concern young Outlanders are matters that concern
Gangrel ancillae and even elders. Still, one would be
hard-pressed to consider the relationship among
Gangrel of different generations amicable,
except in isolated sire-childe situations.
The Beast is ever suspicious of those
who would take sustenance from it.
Nickname: Outlanders
Sect: The Gangrel at least nominally belong to
the Camarilla, but the Clan has always had a vocal faction that spurns membership in any Sect. They claim

54

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

havens, which are frequently short of modern conveniences.
Haven: Gangrel often lair where they can, taking
refuge when the sun threatens to rise. Those who do
maintain permanent havens often lean toward the utilitarian: Everything from a cave to a covered alley to an
illegal squat may serve as a Gangrel haven, usually with
little demarcating them as any sort of personal territory
(until it’s too late for the unfortunate interloper).
Background: Gangrel sire childer like they seek prey:
after long hunts during which the prospective childe
doesn’t even know she’s being followed. Creating a
fledgling means sharing limited resources, so each sirechilde relationship is unique and significant. Outlanders Embrace because they choose an individual, not
out of whim or recklessness. Those who earn their attention are hardy, whether physically or emotionally.
Character Creation: Sufficiency is the Gangrel hallmark, and many have outsider or loner personality
archetypes. Physical Attributes are far and away most
frequent, as are Talents with a smattering of Skills and
Knowledges. Many Gangrel focus on Disciplines rather than Backgrounds, preferring to rely on themselves
more than others. Gangrel almost never have significant Resources, Influence, or Retainers.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean
Weaknesses: Every time a Gangrel frenzies, she
acquires a temporary animal characteristic (which
may replace an existing temporary one). A patch of
fur, a brief torpor after feeding, or skittishness around
crowds — all of these may mar an Outlander after frenzy. Characteristics acquired in Gangrel frenzies need
not only be physical – they can be behavioral as well.
Players should work with the Storyteller to determine
what new animal trait is acquired (whether the frenzy
involved the fight-or-flight impulse may be relevant).
Over time, or in an exceptional situation, a particular animal feature may become permanent, with the
next frenzy adding a new feature. A good guideline is
to require each frenzy-gained trait to have some effect
grounded in system terms (such as the temporary reduction of Social Attribute dots or a permanent loss of
Humanity), though some Storytellers may allow narrative-only traits that can shape the story.

Organization: Regional groups of Gangrel occasionally assemble in convocations that draw from ethnic or
cultural influences. These are informal affairs, geared
more toward sharing information and revelry than
advancing any cogent agenda. Aside from these infrequent gatherings, almost all Gangrel organization is
very local where it exists at all, from pairs of sire-andchilde through terrifying packs centered around one
accomplished Outlander.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Pull off the fucking head and the body will die.
Brujah: I wouldn’t call what we have “trust.” More
of an understanding that we have a common enemy.
Followers of Set: If it smells like carrion, I don’t
want any part of it.
Giovanni: I try to make it a habit not to keep talking to things once I’ve killed them.
Lasombra: I’m not afraid of the dark, so you’d better have something else underneath that cape.
Malkavian: Ten gallons of bullshit in a one-gallon jug.
Nosferatu: When they get nervous, get the fuck
out of there.
Ravnos: If she starts calling you her brother, pop your
claws and make your point. It’s the only way she’ll learn.
Toreador: Assume that they want something from
you when they lower themselves to your level.
Tremere: Fight or flight with the grayfaces. Choose
carefully.
Tzimisce: When I see a carcass eaten through with
worms, I’m smart enough to know it’s rotten.
Ventrue: If you like answering to a master, you
can do worse… but not much.
Caitiff: Unless they pull their weight, who needs
another mouth to feed?
Camarilla: Any port in a storm, I guess.
Sabbat: Self-righteous evangelical garbage.
Anarchs: Almost. They almost get it.

Achieving prominence during the Venetian Renaissance, the Giovanni family built their fortune on the
rise of the middle class and the ready profit of banking and Mediterranean trade (and the criminal enterprise that came with it). However, with the family’s
rise came hubris, as its paterfamilias sought ever
more power, and with that hubris came horror.
With his earthly power at its apex, Augustus
Giovanni turned to the arts of controlling
the dead, and in doing so, gained the Embrace from a forgotten Antediluvian.
With a conclave of conspirators, the
Giovanni plunged a now-forgotten
Clan into oblivion and built their
own legacy on its corpse.

In public view, the Giovanni make a great show of humility and respect. Part of this gentility is a habit of centuries, still in place from when the other Clans hunted
the usurping Necromancers (and to preserve their hardwon neutrality from the conflict between the Camarilla
and the Sabbat). Another part of it is the velvet
glove hiding the iron fist of their nature, remarkable for forcing ghosts, minds, and bodies alike
to bow to their needs. To hear the Giovanni
tell it, Princes and Archbishops alike owe
them favors, and anyone with something
to offer may earn their patronage.

Since those first nights, the Giovanni have accepted no limits on
their ambitions, despite opposition
from Kindred outside their Clan
and a well-deserved reputation as
“Devil Kindred.” They studied forbidden arts, becoming formidable
in the nigrimancy that allowed
them power over the spirits of
the departed, and degeneracy
followed in the wake of unclean
ritual. To this night, the Giovanni are known for the insular
nature of their Clan and the
incestuous practices by which
they populate it. A few outside
families and factions fall under
Giovanni auspices, but the vast
majority of the Clan comes from
the debased mortal family. The
family remains successful despite
all of their ghastly peccadilloes,
and has amassed a vast wealth
through crime, politics, and the
secrets of the dead that keeps
them in their position of degraded opulence.

56

For the most part, the Giovanni participate little in the Jyhad,
pursuing their own agenda of
cultivating wealth and building a
foundation of power in the lands
beyond the veil of death. Outsiders
rarely comprehend the goals of the
Necromancers, but only the most
trusted of the Giovanni know
that the Clan wants to plunge
the world into a state where the
dead and the living commingle.
And with their mastery of Necromancy, the Giovanni would
be positioned to rule it all.
Nickname: Necromancers
Appearance: Outwardly, Giovanni dress with subtlety and
taste. Much of the Clan comes
from the original mortal family,
and have not only olive Italian
complexions, but some amount
of inherited family features.
Those outside the immediate
family often appear “of a type,”
and in the traditional garb of
their regional family branch.
Haven: The family wealth
of the Giovanni is evident in

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

their havens, which may take the form of villas or lavish
estates. The Necromancers often have valuables invested
in their havens as well, such as galleries of fine art or displays of jewelry. Many Giovanni also maintain secondary havens, where they may have elaborate necromantic
crypts or just flats where they can lie low if necessary.
Background: Giovanni of the main family branch
have usually spent some amount of time as a ghoul in a
practice known as the Proxy Kiss. During this time, the
Kindred-to-be learns about the treacherous and jealous
reality of the vampire family. She learns ambition and an
unhealthy dose of duplicity, in addition to the family history and customs. Giovanni rarely see much of the outside
world on their own terms during the Proxy Kiss period,
and often become insular and alienated, while at the same
time eager to stand out among the other family ghouls.
Character Creation: Giovanni vampires often have
outgoing, professional Demeanors that hide unpleasant
Natures warped in their upbringing. Social or Mental
Attributes are usually primary, though some of the “soldiers” of the family prefer Physical Attributes. Emphasis
likewise usually falls on primary Knowledges or Talents,
depending on proclivity. A split in the Clan sees those
who favor the practicality of Backgrounds (particularly
those tied to wealth and exerting influence) diverge from
those who prefer the forbidden puissance of Disciplines.
Few Giovanni could be described as well-rounded.
Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Necromancy, Potence
Weaknesses: The Kiss of a Giovanni vampire causes
excruciating pain in mortal vessels who receive it. If
the Giovanni isn’t careful, her vessel may die of shock
and agony before being wholly exsanguinated. When a
Giovanni feeds upon a mortal, she does twice as much
damage as the Kiss of another vampire would inflict. For
example, if a Giovanni takes one point of blood from a
mortal vessel, that victim would suffer two health levels of damage. As a result, they tend to use blood banks
and other means of feeding that don’t fight as much.
Organization: Like few other Clans, the Necromancers
have a top-down organization where policy is made by a
(presumed) still-active Clan progenitor, Augustus. The
family maintains an enormous palazzo known as the Mausoleum in Venice, where elders and fledglings alike dance
to the whims of their ancient puppetmasters. Clan struc-

ture is itself familial, with the added complications that
degeneracy and vampirism offer. Incest, ancestor worship, necrophilia, cults of guilt, and bizarre relationships
in which fathers and grandmothers are their own issue’s
childer make a mire of the Clan and family, and fracture
many Giovanni long before they become Kindred.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Beware, as all the money in the world
still cannot buy one passage back from the grave.
Brujah: Inexpensive allies or irascible enemies.
Followers of Set: Dangerous relics deluded by a
primitive grasp of what lies beyond the Shroud.
Gangrel: Let them have their mud and misery.
Lasombra: Like us, they stand with one foot in the
temporal world and one foot in the occult.
Malkavian: Once they crumble to dust, they don’t
have to suffer their madness anymore.
Nosferatu: Dead men do tell tales, and the Sewer
Rats have so many tales to tell.
Ravnos: The Kindred have forever to make of their
fates what they will, and this is how they spend it?
Toreador: How tragic is the Kindred so desperately afraid of what she truly is.
Tremere: We don’t enshrine the history that made
us what we are, so why do they?
Tzimisce: The worm that feasts on its own flesh
must eventually starve.
Ventrue: They often forget that Machiavelli
worked in the wake of the Borgias and the Medicis.
Caitiff: Without knowing their origins, what can
they possibly amount to?
Camarilla and Sabbat: Let them have their endless war, for we grow rich by selling each side what
it needs to continue the effort.
Anarchs: Until they build something of lasting
import, they are the ugliest of the sisters.

Quote: You misunderstand the situation if you think you’re important to me alive.

To the mind of a Lasombra, it is better to reign in
hell than to serve in heaven. Fear, frenzy, the power
to determine whether another lives or dies: these are
at the root of the power that the Lasombra hold dear.
Whereas other vampires try vainly to hold the Beast at
bay or give themselves wholly to it, the Lasombra beat
the Beast into submission,
invoking it when it
suits them but leaving it trapped inside
when they wish to
govern themselves.
It is with these
predilections that
the Lasombra style
themselves a “dark
nobility,” an aristocracy of the night that
chose the supremacy
of the Cainites over
veneration of the
Masquerade.

Their regard for such ideas as redemption and salvation
are cynical at best, and much of the pomp that shaped
the Clan’s pre-Sabbat outlook remains only with a
sense of blackest irony or open mockery. The grandeur
and rituals of the Church and aristocracy remain dear
to the Lasombra, however, and the Clan was instrumental not only in establishing many of the rituals of
the Sabbat, but in the institutions that keep it from
descending into chaos each night.
Whether they see themselves as God’s instruments
or as outcasts from His creation, the Lasombra believe
they have a duty (whether to Sect, Clan, pack, or even
just themselves), and obligation to their responsibilities
gives them a wicked sense of purpose. Even a Lasombra
shovelhead may consider himself a cut above the rest; a
surprising number of Lasombra mass Embraces survive,
perhaps owing to the intervention of their sires.
While the night belongs to all Kindred, the Lasombra are truly born to darkness, to the degree that their
very Clan name reveals their tie to shadow. Theirs is
the Discipline of Obtenebration, and it allows them
to wield the stuff of shadow and darkness, and even
reach beyond the darkness of the physical world into
the abyss that lies beyond.
Nickname: Keepers (as in “my brother’s…”)
Sect: The Sabbat would be very different without
the influence of the Lasombra, and they remain its
most prominent Clan. Young Lasombra often make
auspicious starts as Sabbat Ducti or Priests, leading
their fellows by charging into the fray or demonstrating mastery of the Beast.
Appearance: The Lasombra are frequently attractive.
Whether through the Spanish, Italian, and Moorish
stock associated with the Clan, or due to more cosmopolitan modern backgrounds, the Keepers cut a striking figure. Their dress is often conservative or religious,
drawing on years of ceremony and faithful ritual. Rare
is the Lasombra who cannot at least manipulate shadows to affect a dramatic entrance or enigmatic pose.
Haven: The obligation of their leadership leads many
young Lasombra to maintain communal havens with

58

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

other members of their pack. Wealthier Keepers and
those who predate the Sect often maintain their own
havens, whether sinister penthouse suites or sprawling
Old World villas.
Background: Prospective sires of Clan Lasombra
seek both erudition and ambition in their potential
childer. As such, many Lasombra come from professional backgrounds, and display outgoing and even
aggressive personalities. Merit in their sires’ eyes takes
fledgling Lasombra far, and the Keepers do not hesitate
to cull their ranks of flawed, lazy, or boorish childer.
Character Creation: Lasombra often have disparate
Natures and Demeanors. Mental or Social Attributes
are equally likely to be primary. Attributes tend to be
narrow and specialized, showing individual expertise.
Keepers cultivate Backgrounds of all types similarly
in (initially) low quantities, to better diversify themselves.
Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence
Weaknesses: Lasombra vampires cast no reflections.
Whether in a mirror, in a body of water, on a polished
surface, or in the rear-view of a taxicab, the image of
the Keeper does not reflect.
Organization: For the Lasombra, the nights of high
aristocracy never faded, and the titles and offices a
modern onlooker might associate with history still carry great weight among the Keepers. A complex system
of patronage, mentorship, and lineage characterizes
the Clan, similar to the courts and churches of centuries gone by. Childer benefit greatly from esteemed
sires and vice versa, while acts that confer Sect or Clan
status may also elevate a Lasombra’s peers, so long as
she associates her success with her fellows.

Stereotypes
Assamite: They believe themselves lions but possess only the ways of jackals.
Brujah: Petulant whelps in a rage over their own
loss of rule from a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Followers of Set: Peer too deeply into the darkness, serpent, and you shall find that it has the
means to smite.
Gangrel: Every society needs its beasts of burden.
Giovanni: Their inner foulness manifests in their
every action.
Malkavian: The fool does not dine at the table
with the lords.
Nosferatu: They are martyrs, not monsters, and
their faces are the stigmata they must bear.
Ravnos: Filth, suitable only from which to make
an example.
Toreador: A rose plucked from its garden remains
lovely for only so long before it crumbles to dust.
Tremere: They revere only themselves, and they
will reap a just reward for the sacrilege they practice.
Tzimisce: Although we may share a common
goal, a murder of crows is always an ill omen.
Ventrue: Such a misguided effort, to use the scepter of kings only to hide oneself from his lessers.
Caitiff: Lords have ever sired bastards, and have
ever hidden them as their marks of shame.
Camarilla: Who would wish to dwell in a castle
that closes its gates for fear of unruly peasants?
Sabbat: Imperfect, and thus in need of ever more
investment.
Anarchs: They must never be equals — it is
enough that they think they are.

Quote: Wielding the shadows is an extension of controlling the darkness into
which we are all Embraced.

Clan Malkavian is twice damned: once by the curse
of being Kindred, and again by the turmoil that disturbs their hearts and minds. Upon the Embrace, every Malkavian is afflicted with an insurmountable
insanity that fractures her outlook for every night
thereafter, making her unlife one of madness.
Some consider this a form of oracular insight,
while others simply consider them dangerous.
Make no mistake: Malkavian insanity is a
painful, alienating phenomenon, but it occasionally provides the Lunatics with bursts of insight or heretofore unknown perspective. Madness
for the Malkavians may take the form of any clinical
form of insanity, or it may be a hyperacuity of senses
others don’t know they have; a supernatural puppeteer pulling the Malkavian’s strings, or a sense that
the Malkavian is somehow ahead of evolutionary
schedule. A Malkavian may believe herself to
be an idea given physical form or an avatar of
some concept the World of Darkness has yet
to encounter. She may be a nonstop ravening
psychopath, or may be a mostly lucid individual sometimes rendered catatonic by fear of
an impending cosmic cataclysm.
Their precarious stability makes it hard for other
Kindred (or, indeed, any vessels with whom they may
meet) to interact with Malkavians. The Clan sometimes indulges in elaborate, terrifying, and dangerous
“pranks” which do little to endear them to other vampires. These incidents are nominally meant to educate
the target, but the lesson can often be lost between the
vampire’s scramble for safety and the inability to parse
the Malkavian’s inner logic. Common pranks might be
to replace a vain Toreador’s haven door with a guillotine or to redistribute a Brujah elder’s wealth while he’s
at Elysium, or it might take the form of giving a hunter
the location where the Nosferatu gather. Kindred both
dread and resent the word “prank” almost as much as
they do the Lunatics themselves.
Nickname: Lunatics

60

Sect: In their moments of lucidity, the Malkavians offer their unorthodox perspectives and Devil’s advocacy to
the Camarilla, offering their visions and unique insights
to cut through the webs of deceit. Princes and Primogen
tolerate the Lunatics to varying degrees, but the Clan as a
whole has always been a supporter of the Ivory Tower.
Appearance: While Malkavians can come from any
culture, the madness following the Embrace tends to
lead them to extremes of self-presentation. Malkavians
may appear disheveled, injured, or simply dirty. They
could still be wearing the same clothes from the night
of their Embrace or they may have stolen clothes from
a laundromat or a department store during a fit of confusion or fugue. Of course, Malkavians are just as likely

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

to be meticulous and exacting in their appearance, trying obsessively to appear as normal as possible.
Haven: Consistency is rare among Malkavians.
Quite simply, they establish havens where they think
to, where they can, and where they can recall. A significant number of Malkavians have literally no home,
spending each night where exhaustion or the sun’s rays
leave them. Others may permanently have the presidential suite in a posh hotel, a squat in the Barrens,
the dispensary at a county jail, or a broom closet in a
historical landmark.
Background: Malkavians Embrace with all the caprice
one would assume from them. Lunatic childer come from
all economic and cultural strata, though most have
some sort of hard-luck story or black secret behind
them that caused their sire to take note. Truly damaged Malkavians who are unaware of the meanings
of their actions may not even be aware that they
have sired childer, which makes for very difficult
entry into Kindred society for these castoffs, many
of whom end up among the Caitiff.
Character Creation: Loner, outsider, and deviant
concepts and archetypes prevail among the Malkavians, as do Mental Attributes (with an occasional
Social-primary madman or Physical-primary maniac
hiding among the ranks). Talents and Knowledges
are likely most popular among Malkavians. Backgrounds
tend to be either broad and shallow or few and deep, representing the way the way the Malkavian caroms through
unlife. Virtues, Humanity, and Paths often tumble quickly, usually in the wake of Willpower doing the same.
Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate
Weaknesses: All members of Clan Malkavian suffer from
a permanent, incurable derangement. They may acquire and
recover from other derangements, and may spend Willpower
to ameliorate the effects of the derangement for a scene, but
they can never recover from their original derangement.
Organization: Rumor is more widespread than truth with
regard to Malkavian organization, and any number of harrowing tales describe the function of the Clan. Some say
the Lunatics all share a hive consciousness; others claim
that this is in fact the lingering consciousness of the Clan’s
progenitor Malkav. Still others claim that a network of
madness puts all Malkavians in contact with one another and is the cause of their crippling insanity. If nothing
else, the Malkavians prove inscrutable and uncanny. One

night, each of them frenzies when they see one another,
while the next night, they all converge at the same time
at the Sheriff’s haven and accuse him of harboring Sabbat
spies. Who can say how the “disease of information” or the
customs of the Clan travel among them?

Stereotypes
Assamite: There’s something flattering in what
they’re doing. Like I’m a little piece of their God.
Brujah: You can’t hide your horns, devil-man.
Followers of Set: Walking westward, they should
meet the sun before it sinks.
Gangrel: Pin the tail on the— OW, OW, OW,
FUCK!
Giovanni: Ashes, ashes, we all fall down, and get
back up, and dance with ghosts.
Lasombra: A hyena doesn’t ever choose to be a
hyena, I think.
Nosferatu: I have dreamed what hunts them in
their dark, humid warrens, and it is what each of
us can become, if we’re not careful.
Ravnos: It looks different depending on if I close
my left or my right eye.
Toreador: Made up of the pieces of the people they’ve
harmed. Each time they feed they become a little less.
Tremere: If you can rub those letters off their
foreheads, they’ll stop in their tracks.
Tzimisce: I tried to sprinkle salt on one’s tail and
he bit off my hand.
Ventrue: I will make you a fine new waistcoat,
my emperor.
Caitiff: I didn’t do it.
Camarilla: When all you do is look behind you, you
never realize that the door in front of you is closed.
Sabbat: They have the answer, but they don’t
understand the riddle itself.
Anarchs: All they from Sheba shall come: they
shall bring gold and incense.

Quote: I was trying to turn water into wine. Where the fuck did all
this blood come from? Oh, well — waste not, want not.

Those who doubt that the Embrace is a curse need
look no further than the Nosferatu. Twisted by the
mark of Caine, members of Clan Nosferatu are warped
by the Embrace into hideous monsters. As such, they
skulk and keep to the shadows, and they often rouse the
ire and mockery of other Kindred for their nightmarish appearances. Still others are so terrified or revolted
by the Nosferatu that these warped Kindred have little
social interaction at all.
To their credit, the Nosferatu come
to possess many of the whispered secrets of their reluctant fellows. The Sewer
Rats enjoy a grudging respect as
the infor-

mation-brokers of the Kindred, given their supernatural acumen at stealth and the fact that many Kindred
would rather ignore them than acknowledge them.
Savvy Nosferatu exploit this for all it’s worth, turning
the hypocrisy of other vampires to their own profit.
On the whole, the Nosferatu condition is lonely and
alienating. How they react to the Curse of Caine varies with their outlook and mental stamina, but it’s hard
to be an object of utter revulsion and not let it shape
one’s disposition toward one’s “Kindred” in some way.
Some of the Sewer Rats are cruel, as blighted on the inside as they are on the outside, while others are tragic,
wretched creatures who have been cursed with eternal
outsider status through no choice of their own. A few
of the Sewer Rats even position themselves as prophets
or avatars of the Damned, physically embodying the
haunting riddle, “A Beast I am, lest a Beast I become.”
Nickname: Sewer Rats
Sect: Clan Nosferatu belongs at least nominally to
the Camarilla, though many of its members become
Autarkis or support the Anarchs rather than navigating the Ivory Tower’s vicious social labyrinth. Some
even contend that the Nosferatu need the Camarilla,
because without they have no buyers in their economy
of secrets.
Appearance: Physical horror is the lot of the Nosferatu, and their unsettling deformations are countless.
No two Nosferatu share the exact same malformation, and the Clan is a freakshow of snarled limbs,
fanged protrusions, hellish countenances, serpentine spines, ruined faces, spasmodic appendages, and
even features not usually seen on the mortal stock
from which the Nosferatu are drawn. The Sewer
Rats often hide these disfigurements under shapeless robes and rags, but some exult in the discomfort
their presence causes, and don’t bother disguising
them. They may even emphasize them.
Haven: Nosferatu Kindred often make their havens
far from the scorn and spite of other vampires. Whether

62

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

they construct warrens in the sewers suggested by their
nickname or they sculpt a sprawling nightmare-nest in
the spire of a condemned church, Sewer Rats value secrecy and distance from rivals in their havens. Nosferatu of humbler means may well squat in an abandoned
tenement or a disused alley. So long as it’s away from
other Kindred, it’s a good haven.
Background: The Sewer Rats mostly fit into one of
two categories. Some Nosferatu Embrace the damaged,
flawed, outcast, or vile, feeling some degree of kinship
with them. Other Embrace spitefully, dragging the
beautiful or privileged into an immortal hell of disfigurement and monstrosity.
Character Creation: Many Nosferatu come from
loner and outsider concepts, Natures, and Demeanors.
They favor Physical and Mental Attributes over Social, and they tend to be balanced in their regard for
Talents, Skills, and Knowledges. Nosferatu prefer to
specialize rather than generalize in Backgrounds, favoring those that carry favors and information like Allies,
Contacts, Mentor, and even a bit of Influence.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence
Weaknesses: All Nosferatu have an Appearance
score of zero, and they may never improve it. Cross it
off the character sheet. Dice pools that use the Appearance Trait are inherently difficult for these hideous
Kindred.
Organization: Occasionally, a coterie of Nosferatu
becomes a brood or cult, often based around a remote
warren. These can sprawl into vast “kingdoms” of Sewer Rats, who often exist without the knowledge of a domain’s Prince or Archbishop. The Nosferatu are among
the Kindred most likely to share a communal haven, if
only for protection in numbers. As well, Nosferatu share
information with each other via networks — whether
digital, personal, occult, or something less definable —
that defy the comprehension of other Kindred.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Secrets for amnesty seems like a fair trade.
Brujah: Emits showers of sparks. Point away from
face. Point at some other asshole instead.
Followers of Set: They want our souls — usually
until they understand the stench of a Nosferatu’s soul.
Gangrel: We have some common ground in being
outsiders, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be
careful around them.
Giovanni: Down in the sewers we see a lot of shit,
but never so much as when a Giovanni heads our
way.
Lasombra: I try to keep to the shadows, but I’ll
hang out under the streetlights when I know one of
these creeps has my number.
Malkavian: See my face? That’s what these maniacs’ minds look like. Except they’re still bleeding
in there.
Ravnos: Peddlers of lies, they make great patsies,
but they sure can bear a grudge.
Toreador: Sell them dirt on each other and they’ll
scratch each other’s eyes out. It’s the only way to
come out ahead with them.
Tremere: They’re not even vampires, you know
that? They did something way wrong back in the
day and now it’s stuck to them.
Tzimisce: I look like this ‘cause I have to. These
fuckers choose to. That’s how nature says, “Stay
away.”
Ventrue: High and mighty, until they need you.
Charge them double when they come calling. They
can afford it.
Caitiff: “I never even knew my father!” Cry me
a fucking river.

Quote: Nobody down here
but us boogeymen. Hey, whose
head is this?

Camarilla: I’ll be damned, they think their claims
of domain extend into the sewers.
Sabbat: Either monumentally gullible or Biblegrade wicked; either way, you’re better off when
they’re somewhere else.
Anarchs: Sure, I’ll buy what you’re selling. For
tonight, at least.

The Ravnos move like the rumors that surround
them. They are the thief in the night, the raksha
chased by the wind, the nightmare-dream too fearful
to be real. Whether associated with the Romani folk
of Europe or the grave-robbing ghûl of Western Asia,
Kindred society burdens the Ravnos with prejudices of
foulness, uncleanliness, and wickedness.
With reputations like these, the Ravnos are considered outsiders even among those Kindred who
do not ally themselves with Sects. Many young
Ravnos tend toward nomadic unlives, moving from one domain to the next or hiding
on the fringes of established territories
where they can escape if local Kindred
sentiment turns against them. This exacerbates their reputations as transients, gypsies, and vagrant
scourges, but Ravnos
vampires adapt well,
thriving in their
marginalized role. In
fact, many choose to
make themselves into
the ravening terrors
that other Kindred believe them to be.

The Ravnos practice a unique Discipline known as
Chimerstry that convinces their enemies that they see
things that do not exist. Chimerstry does much to convince Kindred that the Ravnos trade in lies and misdirection, but it can also prove to be a Deceiver’s salvation and ease the vagaries of an outcast unlife.
Nickname: Deceivers
Sect: Clan Ravnos often has a difficult time heeding the rigorous order
of many Camarilla cities, and has
no inherent love for the violence of
the Sabbat. Thus, the Deceivers find
themselves independent for lack of a
more suitable option.
Appearance: Young Ravnos often come from Eastern European Romani
stock, with a relative paucity of “non-gypsy”
gadje in the ranks. What few elders of
the Clan may remain are presumed to
come from Indian or Middle Eastern
origins. Given that the Clan is widely
spread and holds no traditional central
domain, no consistent look can be said
to be predominant, and any mendicant
Kindred might be of Ravnos origin.

The more enlightened among the Ravnos
follow a Clan ideology
inspired by the cycle of
reincarnation espoused
by many Indian faiths.
Among some young and
unprincipled members of the
Clan, however, this philosophy becomes a penchant for
capriciousness or an excuse
for chaos. It is these latter
Kindred who give so many
Ravnos a bad name, but
even the devout seem bizarre to many vampires.

64

Haven: Many Ravnos take to the
road instead of establishing permanent havens, dwelling temporarily among itinerant communities,
at roadside rest stops, or even in vehicles. When a Deceiver does put
down roots in a domain, his permanent haven is often away from
high-profile Kindred territories.
Havens in ethnic ghettos, industrial outskirts, and isolated geography are safest and most easily
cultivated for the Ravnos.
Background: The Ravnos are
scattered and suspicious, and those
childer who don’t have the ten-

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

dency toward self-sufficiency don’t last long. In many
cases, a Ravnos will either never sire, or sire for companionship or safety, with little concern for how well
a childe will fare as a vampire. Ravnos rarely seek out
childer actively, instead drawing from those whose
paths they cross on any given night. As such, the hardluck drifter reputation tends to follow the Deceivers.
Character Creation: Outsider and selfish Natures
are common among the Clan. Physical and Social Attributes predominate, as do Talents and Skills. Savvy
Ravnos develop a breadth of Backgrounds that can
give them an edge when they’re on the move or in a
tight spot, such as stashed Resources, defensible Domain, and a few Allies or Contacts.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Chimerstry, Fortitude
Weaknesses: A turbulent history makes the Ravnos
slaves to their vices. Each Ravnos has a penchant for
some sort of vice — lying, cruelty, or theft, for example.
When presented with the opportunity to engage in that
vice, the Ravnos must indulge it unless her player succeeds on a Self-Control or Instincts roll (difficulty 6).
Organization: The Ravnos are a far-flung Clan, with
little to unite them and an open acknowledgement
that each Deceiver looks after his own interests first.
That said, Ravnos often like to make a great show of
Clan camaraderie and cultural ritual, even though they
know that promises made to one another are as fleeting as whispers on a night wind. Deceivers have been
known to ally against common enemies such as tyrant
Princes or Sabbat pogroms, but these alliances quickly
fade once the threat no longer exists.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Half the time, I think we take a lot of
shit because other vampires think, “All A-rabs look
alike” and confuse us with these assholes.
Brujah: You can get into a lot of trouble if one of
these bloodsuckers imagines you did him some awful
wrong when all you were doing was checking out his
girlfriend.
Followers of Set: There’s no justice. People think
we’re the demons.
Gangrel: They know how rough it is out there, and
sometimes you can even convince them to give you
a break.
Giovanni: Gaudy, vain, and easy marks. Of
course, they probably think that about us, too.
Lasombra: Nobody cops that much attitude unless
he’s hiding something to be ashamed of.
Malkavian: Be careful. You can either fool them or
you can’t, but they can’t decide which one it is until
they either take the bait or go berserk.
Nosferatu: Rat them out and you’ll have a chance.
Toreador: They love being lied to but hate it when
someone tips them off that you’ve been lying.
Tremere: Tread carefully or these pricks will drink
your soul and blame you for it.
Tzimisce: Nothing wrong with these guys that
staking them in their coffins and setting them on fire
wouldn’t solve.
Ventrue: I think these cocksuckers actually enjoy
being hated by everyone else. Who else would set
themselves up in the line of fire all the time?
Caitiff: Hard times make for desperate terms.

Quote: What? Those aren’t
bones. They’re wind chimes. Everything is going to be fine. Relax.

Camarilla: All the fancy costumes in the world
don’t mean you’re not stealing or killing every time
you feed, you fucking hypocrites.
Sabbat: I’ve seen this movie before, and the ending
is shit.
Anarchs: Not usually a problem unless they start
asking you to vote or bend the knee. Once the
revolution’s over and they’re declaring themselves
emperors, time to hit the road.

From the Toreador perspective, when the sun fades,
darkness gives rise to an eternal and wondrous world.
Everything is fraught with wonder and terror, low politics and sensual glories, the profound and the profane,
and an undeniable undercurrent of the sanguinary.
These Kindred are the Toreador, and they spend
unlives ensconced in pleasure.
Of course, for vampires of this disposition,
it’s easy to become jaded and bitter. More
than the other Clans, Toreador often
succumb to ennui, or fight the eventual
boredom of unchanging immortality
by playing at rivalries. An excess of
stimulation turns them into
slaves to the sensations they
seek. The most debased
Toreador can become true
monsters, sinking to
unimaginable levels of
depravity in order to feel
anything at all.
The Kindred of Clan Toreador
often involve themselves greatly in
the world of mortals. They have
any number of reasons, whether
enjoying proximity to the blush
of life, cultivating veritable cults
of doting followers, or influencing
and following the trends that their
own kind simultaneously mock and
venerate. To hear the Toreador tell
it, they are the Muses of a desperate
mortal world, inspiring through their beauty or patronage.

“the next great thing” spread through the Clan, and
other Kindred often look to the Toreador to guide
them. The Degenerates know this, and many become
Harpies, Princes, and other key figures in vampiric society.
Nickname: Degenerates
Sect: The Camarilla would not have survived in the nights following the Anarch
Revolt without substantial participation
from the Toreador, and they remain among
its most ardent supporters.
Appearance: Almost to the last, they
are attractive in some way, whether
the traditional beauty of a runway model or the dangerous allure of something more predatory.
The Degenerates augment their
physical beauty with a sense of
personal style, which may take
the form of expensive couture, avant-garde street wear,
or classical fashions designed
to emphasize their appealing qualities. This isn’t to say
that ugly Toreador don’t exist.
Indeed, those gifted with less
physical beauty often go that
much further with their choice
of accoutrements.

Toreador culture is a mixture of sybarites, dilettantes, and visionaries. Some
Toreador, with echoes of mortal passion,
Embrace lovers or “project” progeny who
seem to fly in the face of every Toreador
custom. These either don’t last long or

and individualists. Ideas, trends, and

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Haven: The Degenerates
spare no expense in appointing their havens in luxury,
often with many original
works of art. It is a point of
pride among Toreador to
have an unconventional
(and thus memorable)
haven with modern
comforts; thus, many
have striking lofts and
penthouses, while the
bolder among them

renovate or repurpose everything from abandoned
aquariums or deconsecrated churches to rooftop gardens or converted warehouse-galleries in fashion-forward neighborhoods. Share a communal haven? How
déclassé.
Background: Many Toreador hail from high-society
or “bohemian” backgrounds. Indeed, many are themselves artists or influential among local art scenes or
other subcultures. Actors, singers, musicians, sculptors,
poets, playwrights, authors, and creative folk of any
stripe may well find a home in the Clan, as do those
who serve as patrons to (or travel in the entourages of)
those artistic types.
Character Creation: Social attributes are almost always primary, with an even split among Talents, Skills,
and Knowledges depending on how the Toreador
distinguishes herself. Toreador also love to cultivate
Backgrounds. Allies, Contacts, Resources, Domain,
Haven, Mentors, Resources, Retainers — all of these
have great value among Toreador. Wise Toreador may
choose to develop their Virtues, Humanity, Path, or
Willpower, because with an unlife of degeneracy, they
must frequently attend to the ugly business of bringing
the Beast to heel.
Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Presence
Weaknesses: When a Toreador experiences something truly remarkable — a person, an objet d’art, a
lovely sunrise — the player must make a Self-Control
or Instincts roll (difficulty 6). Failure means that the
Kindred finds herself enthralled by the experience. The
dazzled Toreador cannot act for the duration of the
scene aside from commenting on or continuing their
involvement with whatever has captured their attention. If the experience no longer affects her (whether
by moving, being destroyed, or whatever is appropriate to the situation), the captivation ends. Enraptured
Toreador may not even defend themselves if attacked,
though being wounded allows them to make another
Self-Control or Instincts roll.
Organization: Clan Toreador is cliquish and parochial in its local domains, but very rarely on a level that
affects Clan-wide custom. Certain Toreador (and a few
outside the Clan) sometimes use the terms “artiste”

and “poseur” when describing individual Toreador,
often derisively, to describe whether the Degenerate
in question is one who is seen as creative or simply a
follower of established trends, but these are certainly
informal distinctions.

Stereotypes
Assamite: Blood-soaked barbarians.
Brujah: A fire may be stoked, but if left unattended, it may destroy what it once warmed.
Followers of Set: Worms breed in their vile
footprints.
Gangrel: Beauty and the Beast, only without the
complication of Beauty. Pity them.
Giovanni: Which is more unctuous: their smiles
or their hair?
Lasombra: If I looked like they do, I’d hide in the
dark, too.
Malkavian: The tedium of it all.
Nosferatu: They make a strong case for the
Mark of Caine being a sickness.
Ravnos: There are two types of these creatures:
Awful, and absent.
Tremere: Aren’t they supposed to turn back into
pumpkins at midnight?
Tzimisce: It is a poor artist who blames his tools,
but that’s the only conceivable answer here.
Ventrue: Why are older brothers always such
corpulent bullies?
Caitiff: The worst sort of fish is the one that
feeds from the bottom.
Camarilla: This house needs a good cleaning.
Sabbat: Such marvelous passion wasted on such
craven dementia.
Anarchs: Only a petty ruler acknowledges no
greater purpose than himself.

Quote: Long after you die, I will still be young, beautiful, and adored by everyone whose life I touch.

In nights long lost to the passage of time, the Tremere
existed, though they were something else. Those early
Tremere then made a bargain — or wrought a spell,
or any number of other harrowing methods attributed
to the Clan — that changed them from what they had
been into the vampires they are tonight. Some claim
they stole the Curse of Caine from a torpid Antediluvian, or that they concocted the flawed immortality of the Kindred from the stolen vitae of other vampires. Such mysterious origins, which some describe as
treacherous or even blasphemous, haunt the Tremere,
as the other Clans look upon them with mistrust and
suspicion. The history — and, indeed, the modern
legacy — of the Tremere is one marked by Clan war,
centuries-old grudges, and the stain of unwholesome
mysteries long left unsolved.

sess too great an edge, with their flexible Discipline
and protective Clan and chantry structure, and move
against them both secretly and overtly.
Nickname: Warlocks
Sect: Clan Tremere considers itself one of the pillars
of the Camarilla. It is rumored that they once performed
a ritual that all but eradicated those of
the Clan not loyal to the Ivory
Tower (and thus the Tremere’s
pyramidal hierarchy).

Tonight, Clan Tremere is a Clan shaped
by its practice of blood sorcery. A flexible Discipline, Thaumaturgy is heavily entrenched within the Tremere,
and they maintain cultic havens
known as chantries to study
its uses and share secrets
among each other. To
the Tremere, blood is
both sustenance and the
source of mystical power;
they gather in their witchhouses to further their understanding of
the vitae that is such a focal point of their
unlives.
Beyond the practice of Thaumaturgy itself,
the Warlocks are known for their close-knit hierarchy. They hail from the Old World, with an established power base in Vienna to which all members
of the Clan answer to some degree. Although they
may be one of the youngest Clans — in the terms
with which deathless creatures like vampires measure
time — they are as adept at the Jyhad as any Kindred.
Beset by enemies who call them usurpers and backed
by allies who may or may not defend the alliances they
force, the Tremere have evolved to be self-sufficient.
Indeed, many who eye them warily think they pos-

68

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Appearance: Tremere often
have two distinct presentations: a traditional and severe public aspect and a
much more eldritch mien
better suited to wielding their
blood sorceries. When out
in public or at Kindred
events, the Tremere favor conservative suits and
dresses and muted tones.
When in their chantries
or convening with others of their Clan,
they often prefer robes
decorated

with subtle occult symbols or garb
with various folds and
pockets for their bizarre
ritual ingredients.

Haven: Many Tremere rely on a central chantry the
Clan maintains in cities where it has a notable presence. More solitary Warlocks develop private havens,
with all of the trappings one might expect from an occult scholar, from libraries to alchemical laboratories to
moonlit balcony observatories and even more sinister
oubliettes where vivisected “research subjects” bleed
according to experimental Tremere-controlled stimuli.
Background: The Tremere draw from a fairly narrow
pool of potential acolytes. Those who have an awareness of the supernatural, who are driven to succeed,
who seek answers that elude less inquisitive individuals, yet who also have the discipline to heed the edicts
of the hierarchy make good Tremere. This isn’t to say
that individualists don’t have room in the Clan; rather,
those who go their own way may well find themselves
leading a chantry — or greeting the sun if their interests don’t align with those of the pyramid.
Character Creation: Mental Attributes and Knowledges are prominent among the Tremere. Many have
high Courage and Willpower, but are somewhat lacking
in Conscience or Conviction. They often favor Backgrounds that heighten their relationship to the Clan, like
Mentor, Status, and Retainers (whom an accomplished
Warlock may craft from otherwise inert components).
Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy
Weaknesses: Tremere dependency on blood is even
more pronounced than that of other Kindred. It takes
only two draughts of another vampire’s blood for a
Tremere to become blood bound instead of the normal
three — the first drink counts as if the Tremere had taken
two drinks. (For more information on the blood bond, see
p. 286). The elders of the Clan are well aware of this, and
seek to impart loyalty to the Clan by forcing all neonate
Warlocks to drink of the (transubstantiated) blood of the
seven Tremere elders soon after their Embrace.
Organization: The hallmark of Clan Tremere is “the
pyramid,” the rigid hierarchy that governs the Clan
and makes it the most organized of all the Kindred
lineages. With many levels of membership, internal
factions, and circles of mystery, the Tremere hierarchy
presents a unified face to those outside the Clan, and
is almost as unified behind the scenes. Still, the pyramid inculcates more than its share of paranoia, as both
Quote: When the world refuses
to give, he who makes himself a
master of the world may still take.

rogue Warlocks and a competitive environment of academic occultism pits each acolyte against her peers to
the greater accomplishment of the Clan.

Stereotypes
Assamite: They show signs of being able to subvert
our rituals, so the time to tolerate them has expired.
Brujah: Hubris and a lack of self-discipline have
laid low the Clan of warrior-poets.
Followers of Set: We pursue the secrets of the
world and they pursue the secrets in its dark places.
When too many know, secrets are no longer secrets.
Gangrel: Theirs is a simple but formidable power.
Fortunately, their blood is as susceptible to mastery
as that of all Kindred.
Giovanni: Their clumsy understanding of the
secret ways will shackle them to empty ritual rather
than set them free to work their wills.
Lasombra: A once-accomplished lineage dragged
into the muck by foul associations.
Malkavian: Once we can synthesize their stochastic perception, the Kindred will no longer have to
brook their disruptive caprice.
Nosferatu: Those involuntarily placed outside the
system can prove fruitful allies or accomplices.
Ravnos: Disorder sows its own punishments, yet I
am happy to expedite those results.
Toreador: Form follows function, which makes the
ongoing prominence of these self-worshipers such a
dispiriting enigma.
Tzimisce: Peel away the rot and idolatry and all
that’s left is the carcass of outmoded mummery.
Ventrue: Caesar shall have his due, and to our
benefit, his love of lucre blinds him to true power.
Caitiff: As Vesalius gathered his cadavers, so do we
solicit volunteers in the understanding of our sciences.
Camarilla: A sundered house still offers shelter.
Sabbat: They do not understand their own ends,
and damn themselves thus.
Anarchs: In the absence of structure, autarchy
yields only the brutishness of lesser Kindred.

A blood moon casts a crimson light over the land
beyond the forest and something fearsome howls its agony into the night. The Tzimisce call these lands their
ancestral home. Since time out of mind the Fiends
have been masters and lords of the domains of much of
Eastern Europe. But theirs is a proud, selfish Clan for
which tradition goes only so far despite their aristocratic origins. In fact, the Clan claims to have destroyed
its Antediluvian, and in the wake of that momentous
event, helped establish the foundations of the Sabbat.
Tzimisce practice a strange Discipline known as Vicissitude that allows them to twist the skin and
bone of their victims. In many cases, they
refine their fleshly arts by practicing upon
themselves, but they just as frequently use
it upon their lackeys and retainers, turning
their boyars and szlachta into monstrous
thralls. Vicissitude itself is a much misunderstood Discipline, and debates over
its origins occasionally plunge the Clan
into vicious partisan rivalries.

however they want, and they often want to provoke or
frighten. Some prefer extreme modifications and experimentations with their bodies that leave them looking
only vaguely humanoid. Others seek to redefine and even
transcend the limits of their forms, rebuilding themselves in the images of
angels, monsters,
nightmares,
and things
even less
recognizable.

Clan Tzimisce is a Clan of extremes, and
long, cold nights spent in remote castles have
turned the Fiends’ perspectives both greatly
inward and outward. Mystics of the Clan study
a philosophy of metamorphosis, seeking to discover what lies beyond the state of vampirism.
An alien attitude of spiritual secularism characterizes many Tzimisce. Young members of the Clan
often find themselves detached from the historical
role of the Fiends as terrifying landed lords, and
throw themselves wholly into a cause of their own
choice, whether as Sabbat zealots, fleshcrafted
horrors, or transcendental koldun sorcerers.
Nickname: Fiends
Sect: The Tzimisce are longtime but largely
detached members of the Sabbat. They were instrumental in the Sect’s nascence, and remain one
of its most numerous Clans.
Appearance: Given their ability to manipulate their
physical appearance with Vicissitude, Tzimisce look

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

and prefer to maintain communal havens with their
packs. They encourage the pack to live in fearsome locations, such as beneath a hospital or morgue, or in the dank
recesses of a mausoleum. Elders of the Clan sometimes
have ancestral holdings in the Old World, and the image
of the vampire on the craggy mountain in a crumbling
castle owes much to Tzimisce lords. Rarely are these ancient holdings kept to any modern standards of comfort,
but their lords are strangely hospitable to invited guests
(and terribly intolerant of uninvited bores).
Background: Elder Tzimisce, particularly those of
the still-landed nobility in hoary old domains, may
have family lines from which they Embrace, or they
may restrict their occasional siring to the terrified villages suffering in thrall beneath their estates. New
World and younger Tzimisce aren’t as discriminating
and are more practical. Indeed, many Tzimisce fledglings are little more than shock troops, Embraced and
warped to the limits of their frames to cause revulsion
and revel in bloodshed until put down.
Character Creation: Few Tzimisce know moderation, and thus often favor Physical or Mental Attributes, usually with one extraordinarily high Trait.
Knowledges are usually favored, though Skills are valued as well. Mentor, Allies, Domain, and Retainers are
all quite appropriate to Tzimisce, as are narrow — almost overdeveloped — Disciplines. Their alien mindsets often lead them to follow Paths of Enlightenment.
The ghastliness to which many Tzimisce are often exposed during their fledgling years sometimes results in
complicated derangements.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Vicissitude
Weaknesses: The Tzimisce are inextricably tied to
their domains of origin, and must rest in the proximity
of at least two handfuls of “native soil” — earth from a
place important to her as a mortal, such as the soil from
her birthplace or the graveyard where she underwent
her Embrace. Each night spent without this physical
connection to her land limits all of the Tzimisce’s dice
pools to one-half, cumulatively, until she has only a
single die in her pool. The penalty remains until she
rests for a full day amid her earth once more.
Organization: The Fiends are, on the whole, mistrustful of other Kindred, especially others of their own Clan.
As such, Tzimisce organization, such as it is, has a high
regard for solitude. It is against their nature to be inclu-

sive, and thus they have to work at being Sabbat (though
this is less difficult for younger Tzimisce of at least somewhat modern outlooks). This is also a key reason so many
of them undertake Paths of Enlightenment: to give their
xenophobia purpose, but also to provide some common
point of reference with others on the Path.

Stereotypes
Assamite: The fox convinces the hens to let him
watch over their precious eggs — delightful!
Brujah: They plunged themselves into ruin millennia
ago and continue to blame other for their own failures.
Followers of Set: Why worship dead gods when
one can become a god herself?
Gangrel: They command fierce power, but wield it
with little more than a primitive will.
Giovanni: Muck out the stables, you slopebrowed lummoxes.
Lasombra: Competent. Mostly.
Malkavian: Suitable for making lampshades from
their remains.
Nosferatu: Ah, what marvelous paradoxes, redolent
of the slime yet possessed of the wisdom to adapt!
Ravnos: I’ll take thirty, staked for the sun and
placed on the ramparts.
Toreador: Thou shalt not suffer a bitch to live.
Tremere: They are the gout of corruption that issues forth
from a lanced boil, only they have none of its charisma.
Ventrue: We have warred for so long that they are due
a grudging respect before you snuff their heart’s fire.
Caitiff: How droll! I always thought the term for
them was “spare parts.”
Camarilla: When the serfs don’t believe their
masters, the reich has lost the war.
Sabbat: We play the game with the pawns— er,
pieces we are given.
Anarchs: There is a misguided nobility in what they
do, though they are too childish to succeed fully.

Quote: Why on earth would you think I wanted you to stop screaming?
I find the results so much more melodious when you indulge your fear.

Throughout history, while the other Clans have
skulked about their petty intrigues, the Ventrue have
curried favor with Caesar, whispered into the ear of
Charlemagne, bankrolled the Age of Exploration, and
even swayed policy in the Holy See. Theirs
is a legacy of rulership, from Ventrue fledglings starting their
climb to the top to the mightiest elders whose influence
spans the world. Long have
they played kingmaker in the
shadows in the mortal world, and
long have they been the Clan of
Kings among the Kindred.
Other Clans, of course, find all this
insufferably pompous at best,
punishably tedious at worst.
Someone has to lead,
surely, but why does it
always have to be some
long-winded, self-aggrandizing Ventrue?
The Blue Bloods try
to bear the criticism
of their lessers with
a sense of noblesse
oblige — ever
heavy hangs that
head that wears
the crown — but
even the most munificent of Kindred
leaders occasionally succumbs
to tyranny and bloody rage.

currencies. Elders may command armies or even whole
governments, while neonates conjure their assets from
a website or smartphone app. But for all their wealth,
their distinguished history, and their status among the
Damned, each and every Ventrue must still seek that
one resource that makes Kindred society egalitarian:
precious blood.
Nickname: Blue Bloods
Sect: To hear the Ventrue tell it, the very idea
of the Camarilla originated with them. Every other
Clan realized what an invaluable proposition it was
and flocked to their banner.
Appearance: The Ventrue favor conservative
clothing and reserved presentation, unless
they’re making a point about power
or money. Ventrue Princes may
well wear a circlet or carry a
scepter as symbols of office,
while young Blue Bloods
display their own achievement via suits, ties, dresses,
and accessories that are easily overlooked singularly
but add up to a stunning total effect. If a Ventrue has so
much as a hair out of place,
it’s because he spent all night
running down the Society of
Leopold and demanding the
Sabbat menace retreat.

Tonight, the Ventrue are a
synthesis of the modern and
the ancient, often in stark
contrast within the Clan and
among one another. Theirs is
money of old, from the vaults
of Croesus, but their young manipulate stock markets and influence

72

CHAPTER TWO: SECTS AND CLANS

Haven: A Ventrue’s haven
displays both her great power
(read: wealth) and distinguished
tastes. Opulent, grandiose, even
baroque — these may all apply to
Ventrue havens. They shun the
gaudy displays of other Kindred,
and their style tends less to the
avant-garde than it does to the
classical and traditional. To the
Blue Bloods, a well-maintained

haven is an extension of oneself, and for someone to
see it in less than flawless state implies weakness, distraction, or even madness.
Background: Anyone who has “made something of
herself” may attract the attention of the Ventrue, who
judge their childer based on their prominence and success even before they start to groom them for the Embrace. Socialites, moneyed family, corporate wunderkinds,
military leaders, and even untested newcomers who show
great promise are keenly valued among the Blue Bloods.
Character Creation: Ventrue usually have directorial
or outgoing personality archetypes. Members of Clan
Ventrue favor Social and Mental Attributes, but any
Ability category can be primary, reflecting a personal avenue of expertise. Backgrounds go both wide and deep
for the Ventrue, with almost every Blue Blood possessing
some amount of Resources, Status, and Herd (particularly the latter, given the Clan weakness). Elders in particular cultivate enviable havens and sprawling Domains.
Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Fortitude, Presence

Stereotypes
Assamite: Useful only so long as they don’t become a poison in our veins.
Brujah: Just admit you’re beaten and this will
become much more pleasant.
Followers of Set: When you learn of them in your
domain, do not hesitate to introduce them to their
master, the sun.
Gangrel: Who would guess that Kindred so simple
could be so groundlessly prideful?
Giovanni: Our stillborn siblings, who never developed a
sense of right and wrong or what not to stick your cock into.
Lasombra: Pretenders to our mantle of dignity and
honor, though they are formidable.
Malkavian: When you find yourself making excuses for them, it is time for the purge to begin.

Weaknesses: The Ventrue have rarified tastes, and
they find only one specific type of mortal blood palatable and vital for them. When a player creates a Ventrue character, he should decide with the Storyteller
what specific type of blood suits the character, and this
choice is permanent. Blood of other types (even animals) simply offers the vampire no blood pool increase,
no matter how much he consumes — he simply vomits
it back up. This refined palate may be very narrow or
very broad — say, the blood of younger sisters, or the
blood of nude children. Vampiric blood is exempt from
this restriction.

Nosferatu: Surprisingly functional, should you be
able to handle their odious personalities and overestimation of their own value.

Organization: The Clan-wide organization of the
Ventrue is localized and feudal, with various universally understood peerages, vassalages, oaths of fealty, and
sworn boons taking the place of a rigid hierarchy. Many
Ventrue style themselves as secret masters of their domains, consolidating power in longstanding networks
and forming conspiracies. The Ventrue greatly value
propriety and honor, and use many forms of address
and respect — their Laws of Decorum are complex
and rigid, and could fill several volumes. Almost every
Ventrue worth his status can recite his lineage at least
back to the elders, if not to the great Methuselahs.

Tzimisce: What more do you need than their cloying
scent of corruption to know that theirs is an ill presence?

Ravnos: No kingdom survives by mingling with the
conquered.
Toreador: For every king there is a queen, and
there are a lot of queens among the ranks of the
Rose Clan.
Tremere: They can prove dauntless allies or
treacherous enemies, often both within the same
skin, so let them know who commands.

Caitiff: They are mongrels, barely worthy of
names. You might as well care about your furniture.
Camarilla: It is our greatest triumph, but also our
greatest responsibility.
Sabbat: The inmates run that asylum.
Anarchs: There is something admirable in what
they do, yet how they do it is entirely puerile.

Quote: There is no shame to bending the knee to one such as myself,
so pay your fucking tribute before I lose my temper.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Chapter Three:
Character and
Traits
"When first I tasted the fruit of the Trees, felt the seeds of Life and Knowledge
burn within me, I swore that day that I would not turn back..."
- From the Oath of Lilith

As a player of Vampire, you create a character — an
alter ego through which you interact with the game
world and take your part in the story. Like a character in a novel or movie, this character becomes a protagonist in the stories you tell. Rather than making up
a new character for each session, you create a single,
richly-detailed character, then assume the role of that
character every time you play. As your troupe tells its
stories, you watch your character grow and develop.
Ultimately, the character you create becomes as real
and as timeless as one of the great protagonists (or antagonists) in a literary work.
This chapter describes how to create a vampire character, beginning with a general concept and translating
that concept into the Traits and statistics that are used
in the game. Though the process is relatively simple, it
is best to create characters under the Storyteller’s supervision, so that she can answer questions and guide
the creation process.

describe and roleplay him. For example, your vampire’s
general disposition and attitude toward feeding, as decided by you, might contribute to his role in the story.

However, certain aspects of a character — his physical prowess, his looks and his vampiric powers, for example — are described in numerical terms and used in
conjunction with the systems of the game. These features are called Traits. Traits quantify your character’s
particular strengths and weaknesses, guiding the character in his interactions with other players’ characters
and the characters the Storyteller creates. For example,
your character might have high Mental Traits, making
him invaluable when brains and cunning are required.
However, he might have low Physical Traits, forcing
him to rely on a friend’s character when violence or
brute force is necessary.
Traits are commonly described in numerical terms
with ratings from 1 to 5. (Humanity/Path ratings and
Willpower are exceptions to this guideline, and some
particularly ancient and powerful vampires have other Traits exceeding 5.) These numbers represent the
quantity and quality of the character’s prowess with a
given Trait. One dot is considered poor, while five dots
indicate superiority. Think of Trait ratings as similar
to the stars with which restaurants and hotels are rated
— one is barely adequate, while five is excellent. Trait
ratings become important when rolling dice to perform
actions (see Chapter Five for specifics).

Common Traits and Terms
Vampire characters are comprised of the following
Traits:
Name: The character’s name — this may be anything from the character’s birth name to a pseudonym.
Some ancient vampires are known by many names,
while others are no longer known by names at all.
Player: This is the
name of the player portraying the character in
question.
Chronicle: This is the
series of linked stories in
which the character participates. Your Storyteller
will provide you with the
name of the chronicle
(though he may need
your help in deciding!).
Attributes: Attributes
define your character’s
inborn aptitudes and potential. See p. 96.
Abilities: Abilities are
those proficiencies your
character possesses intuitively or has learned. See
p. 100.

Demeanor: This is the personality your character
presents to the world. More often than not, Nature and
Demeanor are different, especially given the deviousness of the vampire mind. See p. 87.

Concept: Your character’s concept is a brief “sketch”
of who your character
20
was prior to the Embrace
— anything from Crazed

Clan: Your character’s
Clan defines her lineage
and her relationship to
Caine, the progenitor
vampire. Clan dictates
your character’s vampiric
powers and weakness.
The Clans start on p. 48.
Generation: Closely
related to Clan, your
character’s Generation
defines the potency of
her blood and how many
steps removed she is from
Caine. See p. 28.

Health: Although a
vampire is no longer
Experience
“alive,” her corpse-body
Experience
may still suffer sufficient
trauma to incapacitate
her, and a sufficient
quantity of damage can even “kill” the
vampire anew (forcing you to create
a new character). The Health Trait
measures how much injury the character has suffered. See p. 121.
Experience: Your character’s Experience
Trait represents how much she has learned
since her Embrace. All characters begin the
game with an Experience Trait of zero.
Experience is spent to purchase new Traits.
See p. 122.

Humanity/Path: These Traits define your character’s outlook on unlife. A character has either a Humanity rating or a rating in a specific Path, never both
(though a character may pretend). Humanity is the
default Trait (see p. 311), but both Humanity and the
Paths are presented in Chapter Seven.

Willpower: This Trait reflects your character’s
inner drive and desire to succeed at tasks she
undertakes. See p. 120.
Blood Pool: Your character’s blood pool dictates how
well fed she is, or, conversely, how hungry. See p. 268.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Getting Started
The Vampire character-creation system is designed
around five basic precepts. Keep these in mind while
generating the persona you will assume in the World
of Darkness.
• You may create a character of any age, from any
culture and from any nation, subject to the Storyteller’s approval. However, all characters are assumed to
begin the game as neonate vampires who have only
recently left the safety of their sires’ protection with
no more than 25 years of experience as Kindred. They
know relatively little of Kindred society, other than
what their sires have told them. This allows characters to experience the World of Darkness as it unfolds
before them in all its mystery, rather than having the
lore of ages already under their belts. A character’s apparent age is the age at which she was Embraced and
became one of the Kindred.
• The character-creation system is intended more as
a persona development device than as a strict mechanical system. Who wants more rules at the expense of
an interesting character or a good story? The character
cannot exist as mere dots on a page — roleplaying is
always more important than numbers.
• Players have a certain number of points to spend
on Traits they would like their characters to have.
Players also get “freebie points” at the end of character
creation; they may spend these to round out their characters, add personality and further differentiate their
characters from those of other players.
• A Trait rating of 1 is poor, while a rating of 5 is
excellent. Thus, a character with a single dot in a Trait
is either not very good with that Trait or is a beginner.
Don’t think that your character sucks because she’s
only got one dot in Manipulation. The experience system presented on p. 122 allows characters to grow and
improve their Traits. Traits are rated according to a human scale (except vampiric Traits like Advantages and
blood pool, which are rated on a Kindred standard).

Advancing New Characters
Storytellers may choose to allow players to
create more experienced and knowledgeable characters. Indeed, players of Vampire:
The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition
may prefer an “ancilla game” or an all-elders
chronicle instead.
In this case, we recommend first building a
neonate character and then granting players a
number of experience points that allows them
to increase their characters’ Traits to levels
suitable to the chronicle and the age of their
vampires. As a basic rule of thumb, “idle”
Kindred should have a number of Discipline
dots equal to the square root of her age.
Remember that players’ characters are rarely
“idle” like Storyteller characters, so they’ll
rapidly outpace this guideline. That’s fine;
they’re out there in the world, having exciting encounters and earning more experience
than passive Storyteller characters. Remember that the cost for raising a Trait which
is already advanced can be very expensive.
See p. 124 for more information on spending
experience points.

• It is your responsibility to take on a role that’s
not detrimental to the coterie. Vampires are solitary
creatures, so there has to be some reason you’ve joined
up with your Kindred companions (the other players’
characters). Despite the fact that the hostile World of
Darkness forces coteries together, Kindred don’t just
hang out for the hell of it.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

The Storyteller and
Character Creation
The Storyteller may choose to guide the players
through character generation individually, she may
wish to run a troupe character creation storytelling
session, or she may allow players to create characters
at their own leisure before the chronicle begins. Each
method has its benefits.
Storytellers may choose to oversee character creation
not only to ensure the players’ understanding of the
process, but also to get a feel for the characters they’re
creating. Character creation can provide Storytellers
with some wonderful plot ideas — ones they would
likely never have considered on their own. Likewise,
if the players are unfamiliar with the rules, the Storyteller should use character generation as an introduction to the game as a whole, informing the troupe how
the rules work and giving them examples based on the
personas they’re creating.
As the Storyteller, start by printing a few character
sheets, copying them from the back of the book, or use
your own digital character-creation method like a wiki.
Take the players on a “tour” of the sheet, explaining
what each section is for. Let players ask questions along
the way, and help them through the process rather than
letting them fend for themselves.
After the players are familiar with the character
sheet, give them a few guidelines about what types of
characters will be appropriate for the chronicle. For
example, Storytellers running games in Camarilla-held
cities might forbid Sabbat or independent vampires
outright. Sometimes a player will attempt to portray
a character wholly unacceptable to your plotlines, and
you should feel free to disallow this in favor of a character who won’t disrupt the game. For instance, if, as
Storyteller, you want to position the Tremere as universal antagonists, you may wish to restrict the players’ choice of Tremere. Alternatively, you may wish to
run the chronicle with Tremere characters, giving your
players the chance to experience the dawning horror of
the Clan that claims them.
Storytellers are advised to spend an entire session
simply creating characters and running preludes (see
p. 352) with the players. Exceptionally complex characters or secretive chronicles might even warrant an
entire session for each individual player. Spending an
adequate amount of time on character generation ensures that the players create realistic characters and not
simply lists of Traits.

Step One: Character Concept
Concept is the birthing chamber for who a character will become. It only needs to be a general idea —
brute; slick mobster; manic Malkavian kidnapper —
but it should be enough to ignite your imagination. If
you choose, a concept may be quite complex — “My
character is a streetwise Nosferatu, Embraced as a child
but with a precocious level of maturity. Being a Kindred scares him, but he knows that the alternative is
Final Death and he’s not ready for that yet.” This stage
involves the selection of the character’s concept, Clan,
Nature, and Demeanor.

Concept
A character’s concept generally refers to who the
character was before becoming a vampire. Many Kindred cling desperately to any salvageable aspects of
their former selves — their self-image, their occupation, how they lived, what was unique about them. In
their new nocturnal world, echoes of their mortal lives
are all that stand between many Kindred and madness.
Concept is important because it helps a vampire
relate to the world. It’s not a numerical Trait, and it
has no mechanical effect on the game. Its benefit is
that it allows you to formulate a personality for your
character, and it provides an anchor for a vampire who
wishes to preserve her dwindling Humanity — or to
rail against it.
Some sample concepts are presented on p. 80. If you
don’t see a concept you like, make one up! Its sole purpose is to help you express your character idea concisely.

Clan
A character’s Clan is her vampire “family,” the undead legacy into which she was Embraced. Vampires
are always of the same Clan as their sires, the vampires
who Embrace them. Go back to Chapter Two, look at
the templates, and decide which Clan you’d like your
character to be. As previously mentioned, the Storyteller may disallow members of certain Clans based
on the Sect the chronicle involves. Many chronicles,
for example, allow only vampires from the Camarilla
Clans, while games run at conventions or by organized
play clubs sometimes stipulate specific “venue appropriate” criteria.
If a player wishes, she need not choose a Clan at all.
Many vampires in the modern nights have blood so
diluted that they can truly claim no Clan. Unwanted

83

and scorned, these Clanless “Caitiff” are increasingly
common. If you wish to play such a character, simply
write “Caitiff” under the Clan heading on the character sheet.

Nature and Demeanor (Archetypes)
After choosing concept and Clan, a player should
choose her character’s Nature and Demeanor. These
behavioral Traits, known as Archetypes, help players
understand their characters’ personalities.
Demeanor is the way a character presents herself to
the outside world. It is the “mask” she wears to protect
her inner self. A character’s Demeanor often differs
from her Nature, though it might not. Also, Demeanor
refers to the attitude a character adopts most often —
people change Demeanors as often as they change their
minds. Demeanor has no effect on any rules.
Nature is the character’s “real” self, the person she
truly is. The Archetype a player chooses reflects that
character’s deep-rooted feelings about herself, others,
and the world. Nature should not be the only aspect of
a character’s true personality, merely the most dominant. Nature is also used to determine a character’s
ability to regain Willpower points (see p. 267).
For a complete list of Archetypes from which to select Nature and Demeanor, see pp. 87-96.

Step Two: Select Attributes
Players now assign dots to their sheets. The first step
in determining a character’s numeric Traits is to prioritize his Attributes. Attributes are the natural abilities and raw capabilities a character is made of. How
strong is a character? How attractive? How quick? How
smart? Attributes take all these questions and more
into account. All Vampire characters have nine Attributes, which are divided into three categories: Physical (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina), Social (Charisma,
Manipulation, Appearance), and Mental (Perception,
Intelligence, Wits).
First, the player must select which group of Attributes is his character’s strong suit (primary). The
player then selects the group in which the character
is average (secondary). Finally, the remaining group
is designated as the character’s weak point (tertiary).
Is your character tough but antisocial, or gorgeous but
a complete airhead? Character concept and Clan may
suggest certain ranks for these priorities or obvious
ways to play against type, but feel free to decide upon

84

any scheme you please. Your character is a person first
and a vampire second.
All Vampire characters start with one dot in each
Attribute, reflecting the basic capabilities of the mortals from which they’re drawn. (There are exceptions,
such as the Nosferatu and the Samedi, who have zero
dots in their Appearance Attribute.) A character’s
priorities determine how many dots the player may allocate to that cluster of Attributes. A player may distribute seven additional dots to his character’s primary
group, five additional dots to the secondary group, and
three dots to the tertiary group. For example, a tough,
athletic character will likely allocate seven dots to his
Physical category, while a clever, wise character will
place seven dots in her Mental category.

Step Three: Select Abilities
Abilities are also divided into three categories: Talents, Skills, and Knowledges. Talents are intuitive
Abilities that are inherent or learned by honing raw
aptitude. Skills are Abilities learned through rigorous
training or determination. They may be improved
with careful practice, but can also be studied or learned
through training. Knowledges are just that — book
learning and the like. Knowledges are typically mental pursuits or studies learned through schooling or research.
Like Attributes, Ability groups are also prioritized
during character creation. Players should select primary, secondary, and tertiary groups for their Abilities. The primary group receives 13 dots, the secondary
group gets nine, and the tertiary group receives five.
Note that, unlike Attributes, characters do not begin
the game with automatic dots in any Ability. Further,
no Ability may be purchased above three dots during
this stage of character creation — even among the undead, experts in a field don’t grow on trees. You may
raise Abilities higher with freebie points later.

Step Four: Select Advantages
Now comes the part of character generation during
which the vampire truly becomes unique. Advantages
are Traits that make the vampire a contender in the
hierarchy of the night. Advantages are not prioritized;
a set number of dots are allocated to each category. Although this number is fixed, additional Advantage dots
may be purchased with freebie points.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Disciplines
When vampires are Embraced, their sires pass on
to them certain blood-based mystical powers, known
as Disciplines. Each character begins with three dots
of Disciplines, which may be allocated as the player
chooses. For example, she may spend all three dots
on one Discipline or spend a dot each on three Disciplines. Disciplines purchased with Advantage dots
must be from the three Clan Disciplines all Clans possess. Each Clan description in Chapter Two lists the
Disciplines practiced by that Clan (bloodline variations to the Clans can be found in Chapter Ten). If
the character is a Clanless Caitiff, she may purchase
whatever Disciplines she wants, subject to Storyteller
approval. (Note: Disciplines purchased with freebie
points need not be Clan Disciplines.)

Backgrounds
A starting character has five dots worth of Backgrounds, which may be distributed at the player’s discretion. Background Traits should fit the character
concept — a destitute Gangrel street preacher isn’t
likely to have Resources, for example — though the
Storyteller may disallow or encourage players to take
certain Backgrounds for their characters.

More Inhuman Vampires
Some vampires, such as those of the Sabbat,
focus more on their vampiric nature than on
the world around them. At the Storyteller’s
discretion, a new character may start with
four dots in Disciplines in lieu of taking any
starting dots in Backgrounds.

Virtues
Virtues are very important to Vampire characters.
They provide the moral backbone for characters and
determine how readily they resist the temptations of
the Beast. A character’s emotional responses are very
closely tied to her Virtues; these Traits define how well
the character resists frenzy and how keenly she feels remorse. Virtues are essential in resisting the urges of the
Beast and the Hunger, and most vampires lose points
in their Virtues as they grow older and more callous.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

85

A Vampire character has three Virtues. Conscience
governs a character’s sense of right and wrong, while
Self-Control determines how readily she maintains her
composure and contains her Hunger. Courage measures
the character’s gumption and ability to withstand the
proximity of fire, sunlight, and other things that vampires dread.
Given that Vampire is fundamentally about coming
to grips with one’s monstrous nature and, hopefully,
overcoming it, Storytellers who want to emphasize
Vampire’s core struggle of the Beast vs. Humanity can
encourage their players to select the Virtues of Conscience and Self-Control for their characters. However, certain Kindred, particularly the vampires of the
Sabbat, adhere to different ethical outlooks. For these
vampires, the Virtues of Conviction and Instinct may
replace the Virtues of Conscience and Self-Control,
respectively. (All vampires have the Courage Virtue.)
Conviction and Instinct are presented on p. 314. If you
decide that your character is sufficiently inhuman to
warrant these Virtues, and if the Storyteller permits
you to take them, you may circle the appropriate Virtues on the character sheet. Be warned that in taking
these Virtues, you have effectively designated your
character a monster.
Every character starts out with one dot in Conscience
and Self-Control, and zero dots in Conviction and Instinct. The player may then distribute seven additional
dots among the Virtues as she sees fit. These Virtues
play instrumental roles in determining a character’s
starting Humanity (or Path) and Willpower levels, so
be careful how you spend the points.

Step Five: Last Touches
At this stage, the player may spend 15 freebie points
to personalize his character. First, however, a bit of
bookkeeping needs to be done.

Humanity
A character’s starting Humanity rating equals the
sum of her Conscience + Self-Control Traits, yielding
a score between 5 and 9. Players can also increase their
Humanity with freebie points, as too low a rating indicates that the Beast lies in close proximity.
Note: Characters on Paths other than Humanity may
use different Virtues to determine their initial Path ratings. Consult the section on Paths (starting on p. 313)
to determine which Paths use which Virtues.

86

Willpower
A character’s beginning Willpower rating equals her
Courage dots, and thus ranges from 1 to 5. Players often raise their starting Willpower with freebie points,
as the Trait is critical to dealing with a Kindred’s dangerous emotional situations. Willpower is also used to
resist frenzy (p. 299), undertake especially daunting
tasks, and power certain Discipline effects.

Blood Pool
The next step in character creation is determining
the vampire’s starting blood pool. This part is simple
— roll a 10-sided die. The number is the number of
blood points a character has in his system at the beginning of the game. This is the only die roll that is made
during character creation.

Freebie Points
The player may now spend 15 freebie points to purchase additional dots in Traits. These points may be
spent however the player chooses — thus the term
“freebie” — though the Storyteller is the final arbiter
of what she chooses to allow in the chronicle. Each
dot has a variable freebie-point cost based on which
type of Trait it is — consult the chart on p. 82 for freebie-point costs of Traits. Remember that Disciplines
purchased with freebie points need not come from the
character’s Clan Disciplines (though purchase of some
Disciplines may require explanation about how she acquired them, and the Storyteller may restrict access to
certain Disciplines).
Optionally, the Storyteller may allow the player to
take up to seven points of Flaws to gain more freebie
points, or use freebie points to purchase Merits. Merits
and Flaws start on p. 479.

Spark of Life
If you go through the steps above, you will have a
character — at least in the purely technical sense. All
the dots are on the paper, all of your character’s capacities have their systems and values defined, and you can
roll all the right combinations of dice at the appropriate times.
At this point, the onus is on you to breathe a bit of
life into the your character’s Traits. If she exists only in
game terms, your character’s not much more detailed
than a featureless piece on a gameboard. Take a good
long look at your Traits and numbers. Why are they

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

there? How will they come across in the story? What
parts of the character don’t you know yet? Like a novelist building a literary figure, decide on all the physical,
psychological, and background details that make your
character one of a kind, even among the undead.
Sure, your character has an Appearance of 3 — but
what does that mean? Does she have a winning smile,
does she exude a challenging self-confidence, or does
she simply have a killer wardrobe? What color are her
eyes and hair? If she’s skilled in Performance or Etiquette or Firearms, how did she acquire her skill? Did
she always want to be a movie star? Is her polished veneer a reaction against growing up in an economically
depressed household? Did she just, for whatever bizarre
reason, walk onto a firing range and discover a natural
aptitude for plugging holes in targets? Is her Ally actually her ex-lover, who works as an aide to some appalling governor and with whom she maintains an uneasy,
tension-laced friendship? Does he suspect what she’s
become, but helps her out for now because he thinks
he still has a chance to make things right?
This last phase of character creation, while the least
“necessary,” is nevertheless important. Otherwise, your
Brujah with Strength 4, Dexterity 3, Stamina 3 will be

just like all the other Brujah with Strength 4, Dexterity
3, Stamina 3 — and believe us, there are a lot of such undistinguished characters out there. And that’s a shame,
because characters — especially vampires — should be
unique, fascinating, passionate, and memorable.

Personality Archetypes:
Nature and Demeanor
Everyone plays a role, often several, every day. Every
individual displays multiple layers of personality, varying from the contrived to the sincere. Each of these
roles defines how we interact with the people and places around us, and we choose which parts of ourselves
we wish to show.
It is the same with Kindred. The concept of Nature
and Demeanor corresponds directly to the different
masks we wear when we interact. A Vampire character’s Nature is her true self, her innermost being — the
person she truly is. It is dangerous to show this, though,
as it lets others know who we are and what is important
to us. Thus, characters also have Demeanors, faces they

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

87

show to the world. By choosing how we relate to the
world, we are able to choose how it relates to us as well,
as we guide the responses others give us.
Philosophy aside, personality also has an effect on
the mechanics of Vampire. A character may regain
her drive and sense of purpose by acting in accordance
with her Nature. Every time a character fulfills the requirement of her Nature Archetype (see below), that
character has the opportunity to regain a point of spent
Willpower (see p. 267). If the Storyteller allows, the
character regains the point.
Archetypes allow players to build a sense of personality for their characters, and to define a bit of what
makes the character tick. It is worth noting that Archetypes are not rigid; characters need not slavishly
devote themselves to their Natures and Demeanors.
Rather, the character should act as the player reasonably or emotionally believes she would act in a given
situation. Players and Storytellers may wish to define
their own Archetypes that more closely exemplify how
the character in question responds to her surroundings.
After all, every character is an individual, and customized Archetypes should be a logical outgrowth of a
well-rounded character.
Here are some example character Archetypes for a
wide variety of characters. Some Archetypes are better
suited for certain Sects or Clans than others.

Architect
The Architect has a sense of purpose even greater
than herself. She is truly happy only when creating
something of lasting value for others. People will always need things, and the Architect strives to provide
at least one necessity. Inventors, pioneers, town founders, entrepreneurs, and the like are all Architect Archetypes. A Kindred Architect might seek to create
new laws that affect her fellow undead, or she might
aim to establish a new Anarch domain.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you establish something of importance or lasting value.

Autocrat
The Autocrat wants to be in charge. He seeks prominence for its own sake, not because he has an operation’s best interests at heart or because he has the best
ideas (though he may certainly think so). He may genuinely believe others are incompetent, but ultimately
he craves power and control. Dictators, gang leaders,
bullies, corporate raiders, and their ilk are Autocrat
Archetypes. A Kindred Autocrat may crave a title, or

88

he may wish to be recognized as the leader of a coterie.
— Regain a point of Willpower when you achieve
control over a group or organization involving other
individuals.

Bon Vivant
The Bon Vivant knows that life — and unlife — is
shallow and meaningless. As such, the Bon Vivant
decides to enjoy her time on Earth. The Bon Vivant
is not necessarily irresponsible. Rather, she is simply
predisposed to having a good time along the way. Most
Bon Vivants have low Self-Control ratings, as they are
so given to excess. Hedonists, sybarites, and dilettantes
are all examples of the Bon Vivant Archetype. A Kindred Bon Vivant may sire a brood of fawning childer,
or he may spend his time gorging on the blood of drug
abusers for the contact high.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you truly
enjoy yourself and can fully express your exultation. At
the Storyteller’s option, a particularly fabulous revel
may yield multiple Willpower points.

Bravo
The Bravo is a tough and a bully, and often takes perverse pleasure in tormenting the weak. To the Bravo’s
mind, might makes right. Power is what matters, and
only those with power should be respected. Naturally,
physical power is the best kind, but any kind will do.
The Bravo sees overt threats as a perfectly reasonable
means of gaining cooperation. The Bravo is not incapable of pity or kindness; he just prefers to do things his
way. Robbers, bigots, and thugs are all Bravo Archetypes. A Kindred Bravo may abuse authority the system
has granted him, or he may — violently or otherwise
— force other Kindred out of his way to get what he
wants. He’s almost certainly an asshole.
— Regain a point of Willpower any time you achieve
your agenda through brutishness or intimidation. This
need not be physical, as many Bravos verbally or socially cow their victims.

Capitalist
You are the ultimate mercenary, realizing that there
is always a market to be developed — anything can be a
commodity. You have a keen understanding of how to
manipulate both kine and Cainites into thinking that
they need specific goods or services. Appearance and
influence are everything when it comes to the big sale,
though you’ll use anything to your advantage. Sales-

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

men, soldiers of fortune, and bootlickers all adhere to
the Capitalist Archetype.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you make
a successful “sale” of any commodity. Commodities
need not be physical items; they may be bits of information, favors, or other intangibles.

Caregiver
Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on. A Caregiver
takes her comfort in consoling others, and people often come to her with their problems. Vampires with
Caregiver Archetypes often attempt, as best they can,
to protect the mortals on whom they feed. Nurses,
doctors, and psychiatrists are examples of potential
Caregivers. Caregiver Kindred are often the type who
— tragically — Embrace mortal loves they’ve left behind in hopes of softening their loss, or even those who
create situations of grief in order to ease it and thus
validate themselves.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you successfully protect or nurture someone else.

Celebrant
The Celebrant takes joy in her cause. Whether the
character’s passion is battle, religion, foiling her rivals,
or reading fine literature, it gives the Celebrant the
strength to withstand adversity. Given the chance, the
Celebrant will indulge in her passion as deeply as possible. Unlike the Fanatic (p. 91), the Celebrant pursues her cause not out of duty, but out of enthusiasm.
Crusaders, hippies, political activists, and art enthusiasts are Celebrant Archetypes. Celebrant Kindred may
cleave to mortal ideologies that are incongruous with
their new Damned conditions, or they may be the advocates of new trends and causes that move through
undead society.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you pursue
your cause or convert another character to the same
passion. Conversely, lose a point of temporary Willpower whenever you are denied your passion or it is
badly lost to you.

Chameleon
Independent and self-reliant, you carefully study
the behavior and mannerisms of everyone you come
in contact with so you can pass yourself off as someone
else later. You spend so much time altering your mannerisms and appearance that your own sire may not
even recognize you. Spies, con artists, drag queens, and
impostors best represent the Chameleon.

— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you fool
someone into thinking you’re someone else for your
own (or your pack or coterie‘s) benefit.

Child
The Child is still immature in personality and temperament. He wants what he wants now, and often prefers someone to give it to him. Although he can typically care for himself, he would rather have someone
cater to his capricious desires. Some Child Archetypes
are actually innocent rather than immature, ignorant
of the cold ways of the real world. Actual children,
spoiled individuals, and some drug abusers are Child
Archetypes. Kindred with the Child Archetype might
have not yet fully reached an understanding of the
world and have some characteristic such as cruelty, entitlement, sympathy, or hunger that is out of balance
with their other personality aspects, as they haven’t yet
reached the “rounded” state of adulthood. Note that a
Child Archetype need not be a physical, literal child at
the time of Embrace. Some people simply never grow
up.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you manage to convince someone to help you with no gain to
herself, or to nurture you.

Competitor
The Competitor takes great excitement in the pursuit of victory. To the Competitor, every task is a new
challenge to meet and a new contest to win. Indeed,
the Competitor sees all interactions as some sort of opportunity for her to be the best — the best leader, the
most productive, the most valuable, or whatever. Corporate raiders, professional athletes, and impassioned
researchers are all examples of Competitor Archetypes.
Kindred Competitors have any number of resources
and accomplishments over which to assert themselves,
from mortal herds and creature comforts to titles and
prestige in Kindred society.
— Regain one point of Willpower whenever you
succeed at a test or challenge. Note that a test or challenge is more than just a dice roll; it’s an entire dramatic situation. Especially difficult victories may, at
the Storyteller’s discretion, allow you to regain multiple Willpower points.

Conformist
The Conformist is a follower, taking another’s lead
and finding security in the decisions of others. She prefers not to take charge, instead seeking to throw in with
the rest of the group and lend her own unique aid. The

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

89

Conformist is drawn to the most dynamic personality
or the individual she perceives to be the “best.” Being
a Conformist is not necessarily a bad thing — every
group needs followers to lend stability to their causes.
Groupies, party voters, and “the masses” are Conformist Archetypes. Conformist Kindred can take many
forms, from the ardent Sabbat pack member, to the
Kindred who follows a Clan-first agenda, to the trusted
supporters of a titled vampire or rising star.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever the group
or your supported leader achieves a goal due to your
support.

Conniver
Why work for something when you can trick somebody else into getting it for you? The Conniver always
tries to find the easy way, the fast track to success and
wealth. Some people call him a thief, a swindler, or
less pleasant terms, but he knows that everybody in the
world would do unto him if they could. He just does
it first, and better. Criminals, con artists, salespeople,
urchins, and entrepreneurs might be Connivers. Some
would argue that all Kindred are Connivers in some
sense, but those that have the Conniver archetype may
be abusive to their childer and ghouls, or they may be
more persuasive in gaining support for their machinations.

never more than half-full, though it may be damn near
empty when other people are involved. Many Internet junkies, pop-culture fans, and Generation Xers are
Curmudgeons. Kindred Curmudgeons see elder oppression or spoiled neonates running amok behind every
development in undead society, and may or may not
rise beyond acerbic grumbling to change any problems
they perceive.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone
does something specific and negative, just like you said
they would. You must predict and quantify this failure aloud, such as by warning, “The Prince is going
to fuck us on this one,” or “Just watch, that Malkavian’s ghoul is going to do something really reckless.”
You may simply whisper your prophecy of grief to the
Storyteller if you wish, instead of announcing it to the
whole troupe.

Dabbler
The Dabbler is interested in everything but focuses
on nothing. He flits from idea to idea, passion to passion, and project to project without actually finishing
anything. Others may get swept up in the Dabbler’s
enthusiasm, and be left high and dry when he moves
on to something else without warning. Most Dabblers
have high Intelligence, Charisma, and Manipulation
ratings, but not much in the way of Wits or Stamina.
Toreador are often Dabblers, particularly those afflicted with the derisive sobriquet “Poseurs.”

— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you trick
someone into doing something for you, or when you
convince someone to help you against their own best
interests.

— Regain Willpower whenever you find a new enthusiasm and drop your old one completely.

Creep Show

Deviant

You strive to shock and disgust those around you with
gratuitous acts and ostentatiously “evil” mannerisms.
You realize, of course, that it’s all show and merely a
way to intimidate and control others. Outsiders, on the
other hand, think you are the Devil incarnate, and you
revel in this image. Shock-rockers, rebellious teenagers, circus freaks, and the attention-starved exemplify
the Creep Show Archetype.

The Deviant is a freak, ostracized from society by
unique tastes or beliefs that place her outside the mainstream. Deviants are not indolent rebels or shiftless
“unrecognized geniuses”; rather, they are independent
thinkers who don’t quite fit in the status quo. Deviant Archetypes often feel that the world stands against
them, and as such reject traditional morality. Some
have bizarre tastes, preferences, and ideologies. Extremists, eccentric celebrities, and straight-up weirdoes
are Deviant Archetypes. Kindred deviants may observe
heretical or outlawed habits like diablerie or deference
to elders, and they may well go Anarch or Autarkis
instead of having to constantly defend their subversion
of Traditions or Sect customs.

— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone
recoils from you in horror or otherwise reacts in fear.

Curmudgeon
A Curmudgeon is bitter and cynical, finding flaws
in everything and seeing little humor in life or unlife.
He is often fatalistic or pessimistic, and has very little
esteem for others. To the Curmudgeon, the glass is

90

— Regain a point of Willpower any time you are able
to flout social mores without retribution.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Director
To the Director, nothing is worse than chaos and
disorder. The Director seeks to be in charge, adopting a “my way or the highway” attitude on matters of
decision-making. The Director is more concerned with
bringing order out of strife, however, and need not be
truly “in control” of a group to guide it. Coaches, teachers, and many political figures exemplify the Director
Archetype. Kindred Directors may be simple advocates
of established codes, or they may prove instrumental in
tearing down corrupt existing orders to make way for
new leaders or factional movements.
— Regain a point of Willpower when you influence
or aid a group or influential individual in the completion of a difficult task.

Enigma
Your actions are bizarre, puzzling, and inexplicable
to everyone except yourself. Your strangeness may be a
residual effect from your Embrace, or the most effective
way for you to carry out your work. To the rest of the
world, however, your erratic actions suggest that you’re
eccentric if not completely crazy. Conspiracy theorists,
deep-cover agents, and Jyhad fanatics all live up to the
Enigma Archetype
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone
is completely perplexed or baffled by one of your actions that later turns out to be a fruitful endeavor.

Eye of the Storm
Despite your calm appearance, chaos and havoc
seems to follow you. From burning cities to emotional
upheaval, death and destruction circle you like albatrosses. For you, unlife is a never-ending trial with uncertainty around every corner. Gang leaders, political
figures, and other influential individuals exemplify the
Eye of the Storm Archetype.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever a ruckus,
riot, or less violent but equally chaotic phenomenon
occurs around you.

Fanatic
The Fanatic has a purpose, and that purpose consumes his existence. The Fanatic pours himself into
his cause, and he may even feel guilty for undertaking
any objective that deviates from his higher goal. To
the Fanatic, the end justifies the means — the cause is
more important than those who serve it. Players who
choose Fanatic Archetypes must select a cause for their

character to further. Revolutionaries, zealots, and sincere firebrands are all examples of Fanatic Archetypes.
Kindred Fanatics are often champions for or against
a particular aspect of undead society, such as equality
among all vampires, the extermination of Anarchs, or
stamping infernalism out of the Sword of Caine.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish some task that directly relates to your cause.

Gallant
Gallants are flamboyant souls, always seeking attention and the chance to be the brightest star. Gallants
seek the company of others, if only to earn their adoration. Attention drives the Gallant, and the chase is
often as important as its end. Nothing excites a Gallant so much as a new audience to woo. Performers,
only children, and those with low self-esteem often
embody the Gallant Archetype. Kindred Gallants may
be Harpies, or they may have enormous herds of doting
thralls.
— Regain a Willpower point whenever you successfully impress another person. Ultimately, the Storyteller is the arbiter of how much you dazzle someone, even
in the case of other players’ characters.

Guru
Your enlightenment draws others to you. You may
be a mentor of a particular Path of Enlightenment, a
priest with the Church, or merely an idealist. Whatever the case, your presence motivates and moves others
to engage in spiritual or ideological pursuits. Your peers
view you as calm, centered, and “with it,” even when
you are preaching violence as a means to an end. Cult
leaders, Zen masters, and Pack Priests are examples of
Gurus.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever someone
seeks out your help in spiritual matters and your guidance moves that individual to an enlightened action
that he normally would not have taken. Also, regain a
point of Willpower whenever you achieve an epiphany
that relates to your personal philosophy.

Idealist
The Idealist believes — truly, madly, deeply — in
some higher goal or morality. The object of his idealism may be something as pragmatic as the Camarilla’s
eventual triumph or as amorphous as the ultimate
good, but the belief is there. Idealists are frequently either very new to the Blood or very old, and many seek

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

91

Golconda as the final expression of their idealism. In
the meantime, an Idealist tries to reconcile his beliefs
with the demands of vampiric existence, often acting
contrary to his self-interest in doing so.
— Regain a point of Willpower any time an action
in pursuit of your ideals furthers your goals and brings
your ideal closer to fruition.

Judge
The Judge perpetually seeks to improve the system.
A Judge takes pleasure in her rational nature and ability to draw the right conclusion when presented with
facts. The Judge respects justice, as it is the most efficient model for resolving issues. Judges, while they pursue the “streamlining” of problems, are rarely visionary,
as they prefer proven models to insight. Engineers, lawyers, and doctors are often Judge Archetypes. Kindred
Judges might gravitate toward enforcement roles in local society, or they might be a voice of reason in an
otherwise radical coterie.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you correctly solve a problem by considering the evidence
presented, or when one of your arguments unites dissenting parties.

Loner
Even in a crowd the Loner sticks out, because he
so obviously does not belong. Others view Loners as
pariahs, remote, and isolated, but in truth the Loner
prefers his own company to that of others. For whatever reason, the Loner simply disdains others, and this
feeling is often reciprocated. Criminals, radicals, and
free thinkers are all Loner Archetypes. Kindred Loners
often hail from one of the rugged individualist Clans
like the Gangrel or Ravnos, and they have a proclivity for ending up Autarkis by dint of not giving a shit
what some up-his-own-ass Prince or Archbishop says
is a law.
— Regain a point of Willpower when you accomplish something by yourself, yet which still benefits the
coterie in some way.

Martyr
The Martyr suffers for his cause, enduring his trials
out of the belief that his discomfort will ultimately improve others’ lot. Some Martyrs simply want the attention or sympathy their ordeals engender, while others are sincere in their cause, greeting their opposition
with unfaltering faith. Many revolutionaries, staunch

92

idealists, and outcasts are Martyr Archetypes. Kindred
Martyrs are often associated with reform movements
among Kindred society, but rarely as figureheads —
and they need not necessarily be on the pro-reform
side of the issue.
— Regain a point of Willpower when you suffer
some amount of damage or loss of a definable resource
for your ideals or another’s immediate gain.

Masochist
The Masochist exists to test his limits, to see how
much pain he can tolerate before he collapses. He
gains satisfaction in humiliation, suffering, denial, and
even physical pain. The Masochist defines who he is
by his capacity to feel discomfort — he rises each night
only to greet a new pain. Certain extreme athletes, urban tribalists, and the clinically depressed exemplify
the Masochist Archetype. Kindred Masochists might
be overtly self-mortifying horrors who play to their
Beast’s self-destructive whims, or they may be ambitious taskmasters, as with a coterie leader who refuses
to accept failure and pushes his own limits in his exacting schemes.
— Regain one point of Willpower when your own
suffering leads to some tangible gain for you, and two
points of Willpower whenever you experience pain in
a truly unique way.

Monster
The Monster knows she is a creature of darkness
and acts like it. Evil and suffering are the Monster’s
tools, and she uses them wherever she goes. No villainy is below her, no hurt goes uninflicted, and no lie
remains untold. The Monster does not commit evil for
its own sake, but rather as a means to understand what
she has become. Unstable individuals, those who have
been greatly wronged or harmed, and those defined as
sociopaths may come to display characteristics of the
Monster Archetype. Kindred Monsters include many
Sabbat, degenerate Kindred elders, and those who never adjust properly to what they have become after the
Embrace.
— Malignant deeds reinforce the Monster’s sense
of purpose. Monster characters should pick a specific
atrocity, regaining Willpower whenever they indulge
that urge. For example, a tempter regains Willpower
for luring someone into wickedness, while an apostate
earns back Willpower for causing another to doubt her
faith. Pick a destiny and fulfill it. Storytellers, be careful with how you reward this Archetype. For example,

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

a player who chooses violence as an atrocity shouldn’t
recoup Willpower in every combat, but perhaps only
in those that involve wanton destruction, or even
cause degeneration checks due to their gruesomeness.
Monster is a difficult Archetype for which to offer rewards, and those rewards should come as a result of the
character challenging his own descent into the Beast,
not rampaging ungovernably because he gains an everrefreshing pool of bonus dice.

Pedagogue
The Pedagogue knows it all, and desperately wants to
inform others. Whether through a sense of purpose or
a genuine desire to help others, the Pedagogue makes
sure his message is heard — at length, if necessary.
Pedagogue Archetypes may range from well-meaning
mentors to verbose blowhards who love to hear themselves talk. Instructors, the overeducated, and “veterans of their field” are all examples of Pedagogue Archetypes. Kindred Pedagogues include watchdogs of
the Traditions, ideological Anarchs, and perhaps even
that rare soul seeking Golconda who wants company
on the journey.

— Regain one point of Willpower whenever you see
or learn of someone who has benefited from the wisdom you shared with them.

Penitent
The Penitent exists to atone for the grave sin she commits simply by being who she is. Penitents have either
low self-esteem or traumatic past experiences, and feel
compelled to “make up” for inflicting themselves upon
the world. Penitent Archetypes are not always religious
in outlook; some truly want to scourge the world of the
grief they bring to it. Repentant sinners, persons with
low self-esteem, and remorseful criminals are examples
of the Penitent Archetype. Penitent Kindred include
those who scourge themselves of the Beast like medieval
monks, vampires who stand up for the rights of mortals,
and those who subsist entirely on the vitae of animals.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you feel
that you have achieved absolution for a given grievance. This redemption should be of the same magnitude as the transgression — the greater the crime, the
greater the penance. The Storyteller is the ultimate arbiter of what constitutes a reasonable act of reparation.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Perfectionist
Perfectionist Archetypes demand flawless execution.
A half-hearted job gives the Perfectionist no satisfaction, and she expects the same degree of commitment
and attention to detail from others that she demands
from herself. Although the Perfectionist may be exacting, the achievement of the end goal drives her, and
often those for whom she is responsible. Prima donnas, artists, and architects exemplify the Perfectionist
Archetype. A Perfectionist Kindred might be a zealous Sabbat member who expects more than his pack
can consistently deliver, or she may be a moralist who
sometimes applies her own high standards of Humanity
to others in her coterie.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you accomplish your goal without any demonstrable flaw or
impediment, and regain a Willpower point whenever
you motivate another character to succeed as a result
of your own shining example.

Rebel
The Rebel is a malcontent, never satisfied with the
status quo or the system as it is. He hates the very idea
of authority and does everything in his power to challenge and undermine it. Perhaps the Rebel truly believes in his ideals, but it is just as likely that he bears
authority figures some ill will over a “wrong” done to
him in the past. A Rebel may hate institutions categorically, or she may be consumed with opposition toward
a single particular authority. Teenagers, insurrectionists, and nonconformists all exemplify the Rebel Archetype. Rebel Kindred certainly include the Sabbat,
Anarchs, and temperamental Brujah, but also have
room for Tremere who chafe at the rigid Clan hierarchy or neonates who deplore their sires.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever your actions adversely affect your chosen opposition. Rebels
may oppose the government, the Church, a vampire
Prince, or any other holder of authority. The player
should choose whom or what his character rebels
against when he adopts this Archetype. Storytellers
should take rebellion against “all authority” with a
grain of salt, and apply the Willpower reward for such
a broad concept to only greater and greater actions of
insurgency.

Rogue
Only one thing matters to the Rogue: herself. To
each his own, and if others cannot protect their claims,

94

they have no right to them. The Rogue is not necessarily a thug or bully, however. She simply refuses to
succumb to the whims of others. Rogues almost universally possess a sense of self-sufficiency. They have their
own best interests in mind at all times. Prostitutes,
capitalists, and criminals all embody the Rogue Archetype. Kindred Rogues include diablerists, Autarkis, and
a Primogen who puts his Clan’s opportunities before
the supremacy of the Kindred as a whole.
— Regain a point of Willpower when your self-centered disposition leads you to profit, materially or otherwise. At the Storyteller’s discretion, accumulating
gain without exposing your own weaknesses may let
you regain two points of Willpower. As well, you may
regain a point of Willpower when your efforts benefit
the group to which you belong when that benefit comes
at the expense of another group.

Sadist
You exist to inflict pain and suffering upon others.
Killing is too easy; torture is the best way to truly harm
a person, and you seek the slowest, most painful means
to push others to the ultimate limits. Pain — others’
pain — gives you immense pleasure. Drill sergeants,
jilted ex-lovers, and some of the terminally deranged
may all embody the Sadist Archetype at one time or
another; sadism is rare enough to appear only in aberrant cases, rather than reliably in any type or class of
person.
— Regain a point of Willpower whenever you inflict
pain upon someone for no reason other than your own
pleasure.

Scientist
To a Scientist, existence is a puzzle which she can
help to reassemble. A Scientist logically and methodically examines her every situation and maneuver, looking for logical outcomes and patterns. This is not to say
that the Scientist is always looking for a scientific or
rational explanation, but rather she examines her surroundings rigorously and with a critical eye. The system a Scientist attempts to impose on the world may
be completely ludicrous, but it is a system, and she
sticks by it.
— Regain Willpower any time a logical, systematic
approach to a problem helps you solve it, or information gathered logically is of use in another, similar situation.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Sociopath
All inferior beings both living and undead should
be exterminated in order to bring about a harmonious existence. You likely feel no remorse when you
kill (depending upon your Humanity or Path). On
the contrary, you are doing a glorious deed for society.
Some vampires are critical of your violent nature, but
you sometimes manage to sway them with arguments
like, “Darwin would agree that I’m only helping nature
along!” and, “Only the strongest shall survive!”
— Regain Willpower whenever you are the greatest
contributor to a body count after everything has settled
down. This count includes times when you are the only
killer, and it needs not result from a massive combat —
like killing every member of a movie audience or gunning down defenseless patrons in a bank robbery.

Soldier
The Soldier is not a blindly loyal follower. While
she exists for orders, she does not adhere to them unquestioningly. More independent than a Conformist
but too tied into the idea of command to be a Loner, the Soldier applies her own techniques to others’
goals. While she may seek command herself someday,
her ambitions lie within the established hierarchy and
structure. The Soldier has no compunctions about using whatever means necessary to do what needs to be
done, so long as the orders to do so came from the right
place.
— Regain a point of Willpower when you achieve
your orders’ objectives. The more difficult the orders
are to fulfill, the better it feels to accomplish them. At
Storyteller discretion, pulling off a spectacular success
or fulfilling a lengthy mission may well be worth additional Willpower points.

Survivor
No matter what happens, no matter the odds or opposition, the Survivor always manages to pull through.
Whether alone or with a group, the Survivor’s utter
refusal to accept defeat often makes the difference between success and failure. Survivors are frustrated by
others’ acceptance of “what fate has in store” or willingness to withstand less than what they can achieve.
Outcasts, street folk, and idealists may well be Survivor
Archetypes. A Kindred Survivor might be a renegade
under a Prince’s edict of Blood Hunt, an erstwhile
Bishop forced from power, or a lowly Nosferatu who
finds himself kicked from hunting ground to hunting
ground with no acknowledged claim of domain.

— Regain one point of Willpower whenever you survive a threatening situation through tenacity, or when
your counsel causes someone else to persist in spite of
opposition.

Thrill-Seeker
The Thrill-Seeker lives for the rush of danger. Unlike those of arguably saner disposition, the ThrillSeeker actively pursues hazardous and possibly deadly
situations. The Thrill-Seeker is not consciously suicidal or self-destructive — he simply seeks the stimulation of imminent disaster. Gangbangers, petty thieves,
and exhibitionists are all examples of the Thrill-Seeker
Archetype. Kindred Thrill-Seekers might habitually
break the Masquerade just to see if they’ll get caught,
they might maintain contacts in a rival Clan or Sect,
or they might actively plot a Prince’s overthrow just to
see if they can pull it off.
— Regain a point of Willpower any time you succeed at a dangerous task that you have deliberately undertaken. Thrill-Seekers are not stupid, however, and
the Storyteller may choose not to reward a player who
heedlessly sends her character into danger for the sole
intent of harvesting Willpower.

Traditionalist
The orthodox ways satisfy the Traditionalist, who
prefers to accomplish her goals with time-tested methods. Why vary your course when what has worked in
the past is good enough? The Traditionalist finds the
status quo acceptable, even preferable, to a change that
might yield unpredictable results. Conservatives, judges, and authority figures are all examples of Traditionalist Archetypes. Traditionalist Kindred unsurprisingly
look to the Traditions as a behavior model, though a
few Anarchs and elders may espouse a “traditionalism”
that predates both Camarilla and Sabbat.
— Regain a point of Willpower any time the proven
ways turn out to be the best. Also, regain a point of
Willpower any time you adhere to one of your previously espoused positions and it proves to be a wise
course of action.

Trickster
The Trickster finds the absurd in everything. No matter how grim life (or unlife) may become, the Trickster
always uncovers a kernel of humor within it. Tricksters cannot abide sorrow or pain, and so they strive to
lighten the spirits of those around them. Some Tricksters have even higher ideals, challenging static dogma

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

95

by exposing its failures in humorous ways. Comedians,
satirists, and social critics are examples of Trickster
Archetypes. Kindred Tricksters may call attention to
the flaws in a leader’s policy, they may be glib-tongued
devil’s advocates who question the Traditions or ritae
of their Sect, or they may simply have an acute sense
of the ironies of a world that makes vampiric predator
and mortal prey almost indistinguishable physically.
— Regain a point of Willpower any time you manage
to lift others’ spirits, especially if you are able to assuage
your own pain in the process.

Visionary
The Visionary is strong enough to look beyond the
mundane and perceive the truly wondrous. Visionaries
test accepted societal limits, and seek what few others
have the courage to imagine. The Visionary rarely finds
satisfaction in what society has to offer; she prefers to
encourage society to offer what it could instead of what
it does. Typically, society responds poorly to Visionaries, though it is they who are responsible for bringing
about progress and change. Philosophers, inventors,
and the most inspired artists often have Visionary
Natures. Kindred Visionaries may want to plunge all
mortals into vampiric thrall, they may adapt technologies that other, more static Kindred fear or overlook,
or they may have a “better way” to coexist with other
vampires than all of this Prince-and-Regent nonsense.
— Regain a point of Willpower each time you are
able to convince others to have faith in your dreams
and follow the course of action dictated by your vision. Note that gaining support is the key to a Visionary regaining Willpower. Success need not come to a
Visionary, at least not with every step in changing the
structures in question. Her greatest successes may indeed come after her Final Death.

Attributes

Some characters are especially good at
particular applications of their Traits. For
example, a mechanic might be particularly
good with muscle cars, a thief might excel at
breaking and entering, or a brawler might be
infamous as a dirty fighter. To represent this,
characters with ratings of 4 or higher in Attributes or Abilities may choose specialties for
those Traits.
A specialty is a particular subcategory of an
Attribute or Ability — thus, a character with
a Strength 5 might choose to be especially
adept in deadlifting, while a character with
Performance 4 might be renowned for her
singing. Whenever a player makes a die roll
involving an activity in which her character
has specialized, she may count any die that
comes up “10” as two successes instead of just
one.

Physical
Physical Attributes define the condition of a character’s body. They indicate how strong, agile, and
resilient a character is. Physical Attributes should be
taken as the primary category for an action-oriented
character.
Vampires may use ingested blood to supernaturally
augment their Physical (and only their Physical) Attributes. For more on this, see p. 268.

Strength

Every Vampire character has Attributes. They represent the basic potential of every person in the world, as
well as most other living (and unliving) things. Most
people have Attribute ratings between 1 (poor) and
3 (good), though exceptionally gifted individuals may
have ratings of 4 (excellent) or even 5 (peak human
capacity). Some vampire elders have higher ratings
still, while other Kindred, like the hideously ugly Nosferatu, may have ratings supernaturally lower than the
human minimum.

96

Specialties

Strength is the raw, brute power of a character. It
governs how much weight a character can lift, how
much he can physically push, and how hard he can
hit another character or object. The Strength Trait is
added to a character’s damage dice pool when he hits
his opponent in hand-to-hand combat. It is also used
when a character wishes to break, lift, or carry something, as well as when a character tries to jump a distance.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

•

kgs).

truly herculean.

•••••
		
		

Outstanding: You can lift 650 lbs
(nearly 300 kgs) and crush skulls like
grapes.

Specialties: Never Lets Go, Powerful Arms, Reserves
of Strength, Vicious

Dexterity
The Dexterity Attribute measures a character’s general physical prowess. It encompasses the character’s
speed, agility, and overall quickness, as well as indicating the character’s ability to manipulate objects with
control and precision. Also included under Dexterity’s heading are hand-eye coordination, reflexes, and
bodily grace.
•		
		
		

Poor: You are clumsy and awkward.
Put that gun down before you hurt
yourself.

••		
		

Average: You’re no clod, but you’re
no ballerina, either.

athletic potential.

Exceptional: You could be an acrobat
if you wished.

•••••
		
		

Outstanding: Your movements are
liquid and hypnotic — almost 		
superhuman.

Specialties: Precise, Swift, Feline Grace, Lightning
Reflexes

Stamina
The Stamina Trait reflects a character’s health,
toughness, and resilience. It indicates how long a character can exert herself and how much punishment she
can withstand before suffering physical trauma. Stamina also includes a bit of psychic fortitude, indicating a
character’s grit and tenacity.
•		
••		
		

Poor: You bruise in a stiff wind.
Average: You are moderately healthy
and can take a punch or two.

Specialties: Tireless, Determined, Tough as Nails,
Vigorous

Social
Despite their often lonely fates, Kindred use human
society like building blocks to advance their schemes.
Social Attributes delineate a character’s appearance,
charm, and ability to interact with society. These
Traits are paramount in determining a character’s first
impressions, personal dynamics, and relations with
other individuals.

Charisma
Charisma is a character’s ability to entice and please
others through her personality. Charisma comes into
question when a character tries to win another character’s sympathies or encourage others to trust her.
Charisma reflects the power of a character’s charm and
influence. It governs a character’s ability to convince
others to see her point of view. This Attribute doesn’t
necessarily indicate how the character is charismatic,
whether she’s a silver-tongued charmer or a grinning
bully. (These should come across through roleplaying
and specialties.)
•		
		

Poor: There’s something a little 		
sketchy about you.

••		
		

Average: You are generally likable
and have several friends.

•••		

Good: People trust you implicitly.

••••		
		

Exceptional: You have significant
personal magnetism.

•••••
		

Outstanding: Entire cultures could
follow your lead.

Specialties: Graceful, Smooth Talker, Forceful, Urbane, Witty, Eloquent, Hustler

Manipulation
Manipulation measures a character’s ability for selfexpression in the interests of getting others to share
her outlook or follow her whims. In short, it’s getting
others to do what she wants. Manipulation comes into

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

97

play when a character tries to influence or subtly guide
another’s behavior. Manipulation is used to trick, bluff,
fast-talk, and railroad other characters. Whether or not
the characters in question actually like the manipulator is irrelevant (this is why Manipulation differs from
Charisma). After all, a skilled motivator can even employ the talents of people who hate her.
Manipulation is a dangerous affair, though it is way
many Kindred primarily affect the world around them.
Failed attempts at manipulation often earn the ire of
the would-be patsy. Botching a Manipulation roll may
add a name to the character’s list of enemies.
People are manipulated every day, and typically ignore it. (“Would you run to the store for me?”) If the
fact is brought to their attention, however, many people become quite defensive. Manipulation can be the
most powerful tool in a Kindred’s repertoire, but failure
can be disastrous. Characters with high Manipulation
ratings are often distrusted by those around them.
•		
		

Poor: A person of few (often ineffectual) words.

••		
		
		

Average: You can fool some of the
people some of the time, just like
anybody else.

•••		

Good: You never pay full price.

••••		
		

Exceptional: You could be a 		
politician or cult leader.

•••••
		
		

Outstanding: “Of course I’ll tell the
Prince I was the one who tried to
stake him!”

Specialties: Persuasive, Seductive, Well-Reasoned,
Misdirection, Conjurer of “Facts”

Appearance
The Appearance Attribute is a measure of how
well a character makes a first impression. This may be
conventional “attractiveness,” but it can also be the
effect of distinctive features, an exotic mien, an air
of confidence, distinctive posture, a flair for dressing
well — anything remarkable upon initial observation
can contribute to a character’s Appearance. Indeed,
Appearance is the amalgamation of many descriptive
personal characteristics. Appearance is subconscious
and instinctual — it appeals to the lower levels of the
psyche, so it shapes first impressions and the nature of
memories thereafter.
This Trait is useful for getting potential vessels to
heed your beckoning across a crowded dance floor. In

98

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

situations in which first impressions are paramount, or
that involve people who view Appearance as very important, a character may have no more dice in a Social
dice pool than her Appearance rating. Thus, it is critically important to either look your best or get to know
people before you start trying to convince them to firebomb the Justicar’s haven.
•		
		
		

Poor: Your clothes stink, you turn
people off right away, or you’re just
damned ugly.

••		
		

Average: You don’t stand out in a
crowd, for better or for worse.

•••		
••••		
		
•••••

Good: “Let me buy you a drink.”
Exceptional: People go out of their
way to make your acquaintance.
Outstanding: People never forget you.

Specialties: Unconventional Looks, Photogenic,
Fashion Sense, Unforgettable Face, Memorable Pose

••••		
		

Exceptional: Almost nothing escapes
your notice.

•••••
		
		

Outstanding: You instantly observe
things almost imperceptible to human
senses.

Specialties: Attentive, Insightful, Careful, Discerning, Tactical

Intelligence
The Intelligence Attribute refers to a character’s
grasp of facts and knowledge. It also governs a character’s ability to reason, solve problems, and evaluate
situations. Intelligence also includes critical thinking
and flexibility of thought.
Intelligence does not include savvy, wisdom, or common sense, as those are properties of the character’s
personality, not Traits. Even the smartest character
may be too foolish to realize the thugs who want to
“borrow” her car keys are up to no good.

Mental Attributes define a character’s epistemic
capacities, including such aspects as memory, intelligence, awareness of one’s surroundings, and the ability
to think, learn, and react.

Characters with low Intelligence aren’t necessarily
stupid (though they might be); they are just uneducated or simple thinkers. Likewise, characters with high
Intelligence aren’t all Einsteins; they may be better
at rote memorization or have particularly keen judgment.

Perception

•		
		

Poor: Not the sharpest knife in the
drawer.

••		
		

Average: Smart enough to realize
you’re normal.

•••		
		

Good: More enlightened than the
masses.

••••		
		

Exceptional: You’re not just bright,
you’re downright brilliant.

Mental

Perception measures a character’s ability to observe
his environment. This may involve a conscious effort,
such as searching an area, but it is more often intuitive, as the character’s keen senses notice something
out of the ordinary. Perception is a sensitivity to one’s
surroundings, and is seldom present in the cynical or
jaded (who have seen it all before).
Perception is used to determine whether or not a
character understands a given situation or detects an
environmental stimulus. It can warn a character of ambushes, distinguish a clue from a pile of refuse, or uncover any other hidden or overlookable detail, whether
physical or otherwise.
•		
		
		

Poor: Perhaps you are absurdly selfabsorbed, perhaps merely an airhead.
In any event, watch out for that car!

••		
		

Average: The very subtle evades you,
but you’re aware of the bigger picture.

•••		
		
		

Good: You perceive moods, textures,
and small changes in your 		
environment.

•••••

Outstanding: Certified genius.

Specialties: Book Knowledge, Creative, Analytical,
Problem Solver, Subject Authority

Wits
The Wits Trait measures the character’s ability to
think on her feet and react quickly to a certain situation. It also reflects a character’s general cleverness.
Characters with low Wits ratings are thick and mentally lethargic, or maybe gullible and unsophisticated.
By contrast, characters with high Wits Traits almost
always have a plan immediately and adapt to their surroundings with striking expedience. Characters with
high Wits also manage to keep their cool in stressful
situations.

almost more quickly than you can act.

Specialties: Getting the Jump on Others, Witty Bon
Mots, Changes in Strategy, Ambushes

Abilities
As mentioned before, Abilities are the Traits used
to describe what you know and what you’ve learned
to do. Whereas Attributes represent your raw potential, Abilities represent the ways you’ve learned to use
that potential. You may not need anything but brute
strength to smash through a door — but if you’re trying
to use sheer muscle power to force an engine part into
place without breaking anything, you’d better know
something about mechanics. When rolling dice, you’ll
probably pair an Ability with an appropriate Attribute,
in order to properly depict the combination of potential and know-how that’s necessary for getting things
done.
There are 30 Abilities: 10 Talents, 10 Skills, and
10 Knowledges. Each Ability typically covers a broad
range of aptitudes. For certain Abilities (Expression,
Crafts, Performance, Academics, Law, Science, and
Technology), it is best to pick a specialty (p. 96), even
if the character’s rating in the Ability is not yet 4 or
higher. Thus, a character with the Crafts Skill is generally versed in handiwork of all sorts, but might be
particularly adept at auto mechanics.

Talents
Talents describe what you intuitively know, what
you can do without coaching or instruction. The only
way to improve your Talents is through direct experience — with the exception of a very few cases (such as
studying a text on Jeet Kune Do to learn a single dot
of Brawl), these things can’t be learned from a book or
an Internet video. If you try an action involving a Talent your character doesn’t possess, there’s no penalty to
your basic Attribute dice pool. Talents are so intuitive

100

that virtually everyone can execute them with some
degree of capacity.

Alertness
This is your basic knack for noticing things that go
on around you, even when you’re not actively looking
for them. Alertness describes the attention you pay to
the outside world, whether otherwise occupied or not.
This Talent is typically paired with Perception, and is
best used when sensing physical stimuli (as opposed to
moods or clues).

Novice: You’re no mindless drone.

Athletics
This Talent represents your basic athletic ability, as
well as any training you might have had in sports or
other rigorous activities. Athletics concerns all forms
of running, jumping, throwing, swimming, sports, and
the like. However, Athletics doesn’t cover basic motor
actions such as lifting weights, nor does it govern athletic feats covered by another Ability (such as Melee).

Awareness
Awareness is an instinctual reaction to the presence
of the supernatural. It differs from Alertness (which
measures sensitivity to mundane events) and Occult

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

(which covers actual knowledge about the supernatural). Usually, only supernatural creatures have access
to this particular Talent, but some unique mortals have
a sense that something is strange in the world (such as
those with True Faith – see p. 372).
Characters with Awareness sometimes get hunches,
chills, or sudden flashes of inspiration when they are
near supernatural creatures, objects, or events. This
insight is purely subconscious, and knowing that something’s wrong doesn’t mean that the character knows
what it is. To get more specific information, the Kindred will need to use Occult or a particular power –
Awareness only makes the vampire more receptive to
the presence of the unusual.
A vampire can use Awareness deliberately if he suspects that something is supernatural, but more often
the Storyteller can ask for an Awareness roll to determine whether a vampire notices a strange event that’s
not immediately visible.

Brawl

Expression

The Brawl Talent represents how well you fight in
tooth-and-nail situations. This Talent represents skill
in unarmed combat, whether from formal martial arts
training or simply from plenty of experience. Effective brawlers are coordinated, resistant to pain, quick,
strong, and mean. The willingness to do whatever it
takes to hurt your opponent wins plenty of fights.

This is your ability to get your point across clearly,
whether through conversation, poetry, or even in 140
characters or fewer. Characters with high Expression
can phrase their opinions or beliefs in a manner that
cannot be ignored (even if their opinions are misinformed or worthless). They might also be talented actors, skilled at conveying moods or communicating
emotion with every gesture. Additionally, this Talent

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

101

represents your ability for poetry, creative writing, or
other literary art forms. For many elders, Expression
is the subtle art of crafting a satirical epigram capable
of socially crippling one’s longtime rival. For younger
Kindred, Expression may well be the key to convincing thirty stake-wielding Anarchs to converge on the
Sheriff’s private hunting ground with the right text
message. You can choose a specialty in Expression,
even at less than 4 dots.

Intimidation
Intimidation takes many forms, from outright threats
and physical violence to mere force of personality. It

Subterfuge
You know how to conceal your own motives and project what you wish. Furthermore, if you can root out other
people’s motives, you can then use those motives against
them. This Talent defines your talent for intrigue, secrets, and double-dealing. Mastery of Subterfuge can
make you the ultimate seducer or a brilliant spy.
•		
		

Novice: You tell the occasional white
lie.

This category encompasses anything that the Storyteller deems to be mainly self-taught and is usually
(though not always) more active than intellectual.
Storytellers should first examine the list of existing
Talents to determine if a particular activity might
fall under one of those (for example, Swimming and
Climbing would be specialties of Athletics).

Skills
Skills are Abilities learned through training, apprenticeships, or other instruction. If you try to perform an
action involving a Skill in which you have no rating,
your difficulty is increased by one. An unskilled worker
just isn’t as effective as someone who might have lower
Attributes but a better understanding of what the procedure entails.

Animal Ken
You can understand animals’ behavior patterns. This
Skill allows you to predict how an animal might react
in a given situation, train a domesticated creature, or
even try to calm or enrage animals.

Etiquette

Crafts
This Skill covers your ability to make or fix things
with your hands. Crafts allows you to work in fields
such as carpentry, leatherworking, weaving, or even
mechanical expertise such as car repair. You can even
create lasting works of art with this Skill, depending on
the number of successes you achieve. You must always
choose a specialization in Crafts, even though you retain some skill in multiple fields.

Drive
You can drive a car, and maybe other vehicles as well.
This Skill does not automatically entail familiarity with
complicated vehicles such as tanks or 18-wheelers, and
difficulties may vary depending on your experience
with individual automobiles. After all, helming a station wagon doesn’t prepare you for double-clutching a
Maserati at 100 miles per hour.

104

You understand the nuances of proper behavior, in
both mortal society and Kindred culture. In many cases, knowing how to broach a topic is as important as
the discussion itself, and a person with poor etiquette
will never have an opportunity to make herself heard
because she doesn’t know when or how to interject.
This Skill is used during meetings, haggling, seduction,
dancing, dinner etiquette, and all forms of diplomacy.

Firearms
Executing a mortal with a sword starts investigations.
Clawing someone to ribbons tears the edges of the Masquerade. So Cainites adapt, and many have devoted
their energies to learning how to kill with guns. This
Skill represents familiarity with a range of firearms,
from holdout pistols to heavy machine guns. Further,
someone skilled in Firearms can clean, repair, recognize, and accurately fire most forms of small arms. This
Skill is also used to unjam guns (Wits + Firearms).

Larceny
This Skill entails familiarity with the tools and techniques for the sorts of physical manipulation typically
associated with criminal activity. Picking locks, manual
forgery, safecracking, simple hotwiring, various forms
of breaking and entering, and even sleight-of-hand all
fall under the auspices of Larceny. Larceny is useful not
only for theft, but also for setting up “the unbeatable
system” or deducing where a thief broke in. This skill
does not confer any aptitude with advanced security or
anti-crime technologies such as video surveillance or
alarm systems — those are covered by the Technology
Knowledge.

Performance
The Performance Skill governs your ability to perform artistic endeavors such as singing, dancing, acting, or playing a musical instrument. You are almost
certainly specialized in one field, although true virtuosos may be talented in many forms of performance. This
Skill represents not only technical know-how, but the
ability to work an audience and enrapture them with
your show. As with Crafts, you must choose a specialty,
even though this Skill also imparts a general sense for
watching and responding to your audience’s mood regardless of medium.

As the Kindred maxim runs, “Guns mean nothing

Survival
Although vampires have little to fear from starvation and exposure, the wilderness can still be dangerous to a Cainite. This Skill allows you to find shelter,
navigate your way to civilization, track prey, establish a
makeshift haven, and possibly even avoid supernatural
threats like werewolves that also prowl the World of
Darkness. Note that Survival need not be used only in
areas considered “wilderness.” There’s plenty of Survival that goes into getting by in various parts of modern cities.

Professional Skill
This category encompasses anything that the Storyteller deems to be a taught Ability and is primarily
active in application. Storytellers should first examine
the list of existing Skills to determine if a particular
task might fall under one of those (e.g. Tracking would
be a specialty of Survival).
•		

Novice: You’ve apprenticed.

Knowledges
Knowledges involve the application of the mind, not
the body. Consequently, Knowledge Abilities are most
often paired with Mental Traits. (It’s possible to roll
Charisma + Academics, or even Stamina + Medicine,
but such things are pretty rare.) The following descriptions speak of Knowledge levels in collegiate terms,
although formal schooling is just one way to improve
a Knowledge. Indeed, Knowledges can be self-taught,
and the World of Darkness is home to any number of
autodidacts.
If you don’t have any dots in a Knowledge, you cannot
even attempt a roll involving it unless the Storyteller
gives explicit permission (such as where common trivia
is concerned). If you don’t know Spanish, you can’t try
holding a conversation en español on your wits alone.

Academics
This catchall Knowledge covers the character’s erudition in the humanities: literature, history, art, philosophy, and other “liberal” arts and sciences. A character with dots in Academics is generally well rounded
in these fields, and at high levels may be considered an
expert in one or more areas of study. Not only can this
Knowledge impress at salons and other Elysium functions, but it can also offer valuable clues to certain past
— and future — movements in the Jyhad. If you like,
you can choose a specialty for Academics even at less
than 4 dots.

Law
The Law Knowledge represents a knowledge of both
legal statutes and proper procedures for enforcing
them. Law can be useful for filing suits, avoiding lawsuits, or getting out of jail. What’s more, the Kindred
keep their own laws, and more than one vampire has
saved his own unlife by deftly exploiting a loophole
in one of the Traditions. The Law Knowledge has any
number of specialties, and a player may choose one for
her character when she takes this Ability, representing
both her field of experience and a general sense for how
the legal system (especially in her locality) functions,

Occult
You are knowledgeable in occult areas such as mysticism, curses, magic, folklore, and particularly vampire
lore. Unlike most other Knowledges, Occult does not
imply a command of hard facts. Much of what you
know may well be rumor, myth, speculation, or hearsay. However, the secrets to be learned in this field are
worth centuries of sifting legend from fact. High levels
of Occult imply a deep understanding of vampire lore,
as well as a good grounding in other aspects of the occult. At the very least, you can discern what is patently
false.

Technology
The Technology Knowledge represents a broad acumen with electronics, computer hardware, and devices
more elaborate than “machines,” which fall under the
Crafts Skill. If it has a processor, a transistor, or an integrated circuit — if it’s electronic rather than electrical
— manipulating it uses the Technology Knowledge.
This is the wide-ranging Ability used to build one’s
own computer, install (or subvert) a security system,
repair a mobile phone, or kitbash a shortwave radio.
You must always choose a specialization in Technology, even though you possess some skill in multiple
fields.

Expert Knowledge
Like Hobby Talent and Professional Skill, this is a
catchall category. An Expert Knowledge is anything
that is primarily intellectual or mental in nature and
must be studied. Storytellers should first examine the
list of existing Knowledges to determine if a particular
field of expertise might fall under one of those (e.g. Forensics would be a specialty of Investigation).
•		
		
		

Student: You’ve taken an 		
undergraduate course or read a few
books.

••		
		

College: You may have minored in
the field.

•••		
		
		

Masters: You might hold a degree and
are well versed in what’s been

•••••
		
		

Scholar: You know the hidden 		
mysteries of your field and are a 		
veritable font of information.

Suggested Expert Knowledges: Archaeology, Game
Theory, Military Science, Psychology

Backgrounds
Backgrounds describe advantages of relationship,
circumstance, and opportunity: material possessions,
social networks, and the like. Backgrounds are external, not internal, Traits, and you should always rationalize how you came to possess them, as well as what
they represent. Who are your contacts? Why do your
allies support you? Where did you meet your retainers?
What investments do you possess that yield your four
dots in Resources? If you’ve put enough detail into your
character concept, selecting appropriate Backgrounds
should be easy.
Although it’s uncommon to make rolls involving
Background Traits, your Storyteller might have you
do so to see if you can obtain information, goods, or
favors. For example, you might have to roll Wits + Resources to keep your stock portfolio healthy, or Manipulation + Contacts to wheedle that extra favor from
your smuggler “associate.”
Certain Backgrounds may be “pooled” among characters in a coterie. See “Pooling Backgrounds” on
p. 118 for more information.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

Allies
Allies are mortals who support and help you — family, friends, or even a mortal organization that owes you
some loyalty. Although allies aid you willingly, without coaxing or coercion, they are not always available
to offer assistance; they have their own concerns and
can do only so much for the sake of your relationship.
However, they might have some useful Background
Traits of their own, and could provide you with indirect access to their contacts, influence, or resources.
Allies are typically persons of influence and power
in your home city. They can be of almost any sort, depending on what your Storyteller will allow. You may
have friends in the precinct morgue, at a prominent
blog, among the high society of local celebrities, or at
a construction site. Your Allies might be a clan of nomads who move their mobile home camp around the
area, or they might be a family of generations of police
officers. You may even count the mayor himself among
your friends, depending on how many dots you spend
on this Trait. Your Allies are generally trustworthy
(though they probably don’t know that you’re a vampire, or even that vampires exist). However, nothing
comes for free. If you wind up drawing favors from your
friend in the Cosa Nostra, he’ll probably ask you to do
him a favor in kind in the future. This often leads to
the beginning of a story.…
Allies may be pooled among a coterie of characters.
•		
		

One ally of moderate influence and
power

••		

Two allies, both of moderate power

•••		
		

Three allies, one of whom is quite
influential

••••		
		

Four allies, one of whom is very 		
influential

•••••
		

Five allies, one of whom is extremely
influential

Alternate Identity
You maintain an alternate identity, complete with
papers, birth certificates, or any other documentation
you desire. Only a few may know your real name or
identity. Your alternate persona may be highly involved in organized crime, a member of the opposite
Sect, a con artist who uses alternate identities for her
game, or you may simply gather information about the
enemy. Indeed, some vampires may know you as one

individual while others believe you to be someone else
entirely.
•		
		
		

You are new at this identity game.
Sometimes you slip and forget your
other persona.

••		
		
		
		
		

You are well grounded in your 		
alternate identity. You are 		
convincing enough to play the part
of a doctor, lawyer, funeral salesman,
drug-smuggler, or a capable spy.

•••

Black Hand Membership
This Background is for Sabbat characters only.
You are a member of the feared Black Hand, the
body of soldiers and assassins that serves the Sabbat
fervently. Having this Background indicates that you
are a full-fledged member of the organization, and you
have all the responsibilities and benefits that accompany membership.
You may call upon members of the Black Hand to
aid you, should you ever need it. Of course, this ability is a two-way street, and other Hand members may
call upon you to aid them. Thus, you may find yourself
assigned to perform assassinations, lend martial aid, or
even further the political ends of the Hand as a diplomat or spy. You may also be required to attend crusades
that take you away from your pack. All members of the
Black Hand must heed the call of another Hand member, especially the superiors of the faction.
Being a member of the Black Hand is a prestigious
matter, and other members of the Sabbat respect the
organization. When dealing with other Sabbat, should
you choose to reveal your affiliation with the Hand,
you may add your rating in this Background to any

cops, DMV clerks, club bouncers, or members of an

various “passing acquaintances” before play. Instead,
to successfully get in touch with a minor contact, you
should roll your Contacts rating (difficulty 7). You can
reach one minor contact for each success. Of course,
you still have to convince them to give you the information you need, assuming they can get it.

Contacts
You know people all over the city. When you start
making phone calls around your network, the amount
of information you can dig up is impressive. Rather
than friends you can rely on to help you, like Allies,
Contacts are largely people whom you can bribe, manipulate, or coerce into offering information. You also
have a few major Contacts — associates who can give
you accurate information in their fields of expertise.
You should describe each major contact in some detail
before the game begins.
In addition to your major contacts, you also have a
number of minor contacts spread throughout the city.
Your major contact might be in the district attorney’s

112

Contacts may be pooled within the characters’ coterie.

Domain
Domain is physical territory (usually within the
chronicle’s central city) to which your character controls access for the purpose of feeding. Some Kindred
refer to their domain as hunting grounds, and most
jealously guard their domains, even invoking the Tradition of the same name to protect their claims. As
part of this Background, the character’s claim to the
domain is recognized by the Prince or some other Kindred authority in the city where it is located.
The Kindred who claims the domain can’t keep the
living inhabitants from going about their business,
nor does she exercise any direct influence over them,
but she can keep watch herself and mind their comings and goings. She can also have Allies or Retainers
specifically look for unfamiliar vampires and alert her
when they find some.
Domain refers specifically to the geography (in most
cases a neighborhood or street) and properties on it,
as opposed to the people who may dwell there (which
is the emphasis of Herd). Domain plays an important
part in Kindred society — vampires who lack significant Domain seldom earn respect — but it isn’t an automatic entitlement to status among the Damned.
You may designate one or more dots in Domain to
increase the security of your character’s territory rather
than its size. Each dot so assigned to security provides
a +1 difficulty penalty to efforts to intrude into the domain by anyone your character hasn’t specifically al-

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

lowed in, and a -1 difficulty bonus to efforts by your
character to identify and track intruders in the domain.
A Domain of one dot’s size and two dots’ security, for
instance, is small but quite resistant to intrusion, as opposed to a Domain rating of three dots’ size with no
extraordinary security.
Each level of Domain reduces the difficulty of hunting checks by one for your character and those whom
the character allows in. It also adds to your starting (not
maximum) blood pool. If you use the domain security
option, each dot of domain security raises the difficulty
of hunting checks by one for uninvited vampires. See
p. 259 for more information on hunting.

region as a domain. Ten to 15 dots secure an important
but not geographically huge city sector, such as “the
docks,” or “Highland Park.” A large city itself might
be a hundred-plus Domain points, as with Atlanta,
Dallas, Geneva, or Baghdad. A city such as New York,
London, Paris, Rome, Sao Paolo, or Shanghai would
require many hundreds of Domain points.

Fame

Generation

You enjoy widespread recognition in mortal society,
perhaps as an entertainer, writer, or athlete. People
may enjoy just being seen with you. This gives you all
manner of privileges when moving in mortal society,
but can also attract an unwanted amount of attention
now that you’re no longer alive. The greatest weapon
fame has to offer is the ability to sway public opinion — as modern media constantly proves. Fame isn’t
always tied to entertainment: A heinous criminal in
a high-profile trial probably has a certain amount of
fame, as do a lawmaker and a scientist who has made a
popularized discovery.

This Background represents your Generation: the
purity of your blood, and your proximity to the First
Vampire. A high Generation rating may represent
a powerful sire or a decidedly dangerous taste for diablerie. If you don’t take any dots in this Trait, you
begin play as a Thirteenth Generation vampire. See
p. 270 for further information.

This Background is obviously a mixed blessing. You
can certainly enjoy the privileges of your prestige —
getting the best seats, being invited to events you’d
otherwise miss, getting appointments with the elite
— but you’re sometimes recognized when you’d rather
not be. However, your enemies can’t just make you disappear without causing an undue stir, and you find it
much easier to hunt in populated areas as people flock
to you (reduce the difficulties of hunting rolls by one
for each dot in Fame). Additionally, your Storyteller
might permit you to reduce difficulties of certain Social
rolls against particularly star-struck or impressionable
people.

circles of kinky clubgoers to actual cults built around
you as a god-figure. In addition to providing nourishment, your herd might come in handy for minor tasks,
though they are typically not very controllable, closely
connected to you, or particularly skilled (for more effective pawns, purchase Allies or Retainers). Your

A mentor typically remains aloof, giving you useful information or advice out of camaraderie, but will abandon you without a thought if you prove an unworthy or
troublesome protégé.

Some rolls may require you to use Influence in place
of an Ability, particularly when attempting to sway minor bureaucrats. It’s easier to institute sweeping changes on a local level than a worldwide scale (e.g., having

Mentor
This Trait represents a Kindred or group of Kindred
who looks out for you, offering guidance or aid once in
a while. A mentor may be powerful, but his power need
not be direct. Depending on the number of dots in this
Background, your mentor might be nothing more than
a vampire with a remarkable information network, or
might be a centuries-old creature with tremendous influence and supernatural power. He may offer advice,
speak to the Prince or Archbishop on your behalf,
steer other elders clear of you, or warn you when you’re
walking into situations you don’t understand.
Most often your mentor is your sire, but it could well
be any Cainite with an interest in your wellbeing. A
high Mentor rating could even represent a group of
like-minded vampires, such as the elders of the city’s
Tremere chantry or a Black Hand cell.
Bear in mind that this Trait isn’t a “Get out of Jail
Free” card. Your mentor won’t necessarily arrive like
the cavalry whenever you’re endangered (and if she
does, you’re likely to lose a dot or more in this Background after rousing her ire). What’s more, she might
occasionally expect something in return for her patron-

Resources
Resources are valuable goods whose disposition your
character controls. These assets may be actual cash,
but as this Background increases, they’re more likely
to be investments, property, or earning capital of some
sort — land, industrial assets, stocks and bonds, commercial inventories, criminal infrastructure, contraband, even taxes or tithes. Remember that vampires
don’t need to arrange for any food except blood and
their actual needs (as opposed to wants) for shelter are
very easily accommodated. Resources for vampires go
mostly to pay for luxuries and the associated expenses
of developing and maintaining Status, Influence, and
other Backgrounds. A character with no dots in Resources may have enough clothing and supplies to get
by, or she may be destitute and squatting in a refrigerator box under an overpass.
You receive a basic allowance each month based on
your rating, so be certain to detail exactly where this
money comes from, be it a job, trust fund or dividends.
(Storytellers, decide for your locality and any relevant
time period what an appropriate amount of cash this
monthly allowance is.) After all, a Kindred’s fortune
may well run out over the course of the chronicle, depending on how well he maintains it. You can also sell
your less liquid resources if you need the cash, but this
can take weeks or even months, depending on what
exactly you’re trying to sell. Art buyers don’t just pop
out of the woodwork, after all.

of your modes of transportation. You
have vast and widely distributed
assets, perhaps tied to the fates of
nations, each with huge staffs and
connections to every level of 		
society through a region. You 		
travel with a minimum of three-dot
comforts, more with a little effort.
Corporations and governments 		
sometimes come to you to buy into
stocks or bond programs.

Retainers
Not precisely Allies or Contacts, your retainers are servants, assistants, or other people who are your loyal and
steadfast companions. Many vampires’ servants are ghouls
(p. 496) — their supernatural powers and blood bond-enforced loyalty make them the servants of choice. Retainers
may also be people whom you’ve repeatedly Dominated
until they have no free will left, or followers so enthralled
with your Presence that their loyalty borders on blind fanaticism. Some vampires, particularly those with the Animalism Discipline, use animal ghouls as retainers.
You must maintain some control over your retainers,
whether through a salary, the gift of your vitae, or the
use of Disciplines. Retainers are never “blindly loyal no
matter what” — if you treat them poorly without exercising strict control, they might well turn on you.
Retainers may be useful, but they should never be
flawless. A physically powerful ghoul might be rebellious, inconveniently dull-witted, or lacking in practical skills. A loyal manservant might be physically weak
or possess no real personal initiative or creativity. This
Background isn’t an excuse to craft an unstoppable
bodyguard or pet assassin — it’s a method to bring more
fully-developed characters into the chronicle, as well
as to reflect the followers for which the Kindred are
notorious. Generally, retainers are more like Renfield
than Anita Blake. (If the player and Storyteller agree,
a player may create a more competent single Retainer
by combining more points in this Background, putting
more eggs in one basket, as the saying goes.)
Players can spend pooled Background points on Retainers.

Status
You have something of a reputation and standing
(earned or unearned) within the local community of
Kindred. Status among Camarilla society is as often
derived from your sire’s status and the respect due your
particular bloodline as it is by personal achievement.
Among the Sabbat, status is more likely to stem from
the reputation of your pack or the zeal of your outlook.
Elders are known for having little respect for their juniors; this Background can mitigate that somewhat.
High status within the Camarilla does not transfer to
Sabbat society (and will most likely make you a notorious target for your Sect’s rivals), and vice versa. Similarly, Autarkis generally have zero Status, unless they
have somehow garnered so much power and attention
that they are considered forces to be reckoned with.
You may have occasion to roll your Status in conjunction with a Social Trait; this reflects the positive effects
of your prestige.
Note that Caitiff characters may not purchase Status
during character creation. Caitiff are the lowest of the
low, and any respect they achieve must be earned during the course of the chronicle.

Pooling Backgrounds
Some Backgrounds lend themselves to joint ownership. Specifically, the members of a coterie may choose
to pool their individual stores of Allies, Contacts, Domain, Herd, Influence, Resources, and Retainers.

The Anchor
You and the other players choose one Background as
the anchor that holds the shared assets together. For
example, this Background might be Domain, with the
physical place the characters claim as their haven and
for hunting, which also acts as a meeting ground for the
mortals they deal with, a repository for their wealth,
and so on. Any of the poolable Backgrounds can serve
in this role, however: Herd might be this coterie’s key
to sustenance and stability.

118

No Background pool can have more dots assigned to
it than the Anchor Background does at any time. If
the Background is damaged by events during play or
between sessions, other assets drift away from the characters’ control, and it takes effort to win them back.
Any character contributing to the pool may pull his
stake out at any time. The dislocations guarantee some
damage: The character gets back one dot less than he
put in.
Example: The members of the Bloody Sunday coterie
build their Background pool around Domain. The physical
territory of a ruined church and its economically depressed
environs give them the opportunity to interact with downand-out members of their squalid neighborhood and a ragged
group of mortals who fear the creepy squatters in the old
church. They put a total of four dots into the Domain pool.
Members of the coterie also spend three points on pooled
Resources and three points on pooled Influence.
Then things go awry. A Sabbat incursion leads to the
arrival of a trouble-shooting Archon, and in the city’s paranoia, another coterie mistakes Bloody Sunday for a Sabbat
pack and sets the church on fire. The Domain rating drops
from 4 to 2. Nobody comes to a burned-down church to
score, so the coterie’s drug-related Resources also drops to
2. With the church slated for demolition (after a particularly harrowing encounter, the coterie barely avoided the
fire marshal discovering that they made their haven there),
the coterie’s pooled Influence also falls from 3 to 2 as they
fight the zoning and demolition permits through proxies.
Sustained effort by Bloody Sunday can repair the damage. Many options are available, from having the church
declared a local historical site and thus exempt from demolition “pending repairs” — to taking a tricky political path
and trying to achieve satisfaction from the mistaken coterie
(or overzealous Archon…).
As the Anchor Background rating rises again, so do
the ratings of those anchored to it, as a result of storytelling directed toward the goals of improving lost
Backgrounds.
Under normal circumstances, a coterie can’t change
its Anchor Background, nor can it acquire a new Anchor Background. While it may choose to abandon a
certain Background asset over the course of a chronicle
(and thus free itself of the limitations of the pooled
Backgrounds in question), the fact that Backgrounds
change value only as a result of the story’s events
means that the coterie must acquire new Backgrounds
in that manner, rather than through freebie or experience points.

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

In the end, most vampires end up following personal
goals over the course of their unlives. Pooled Backgrounds are a great way for young Kindred to gain an
initial advantage as neonates in the World of Darkness, but they quickly become outdated or even liabilities as the Kindred formerly attached to them pursue
their own, private agendas.

Using Pooled Backgrounds
Pooled Backgrounds are shared resources; essentially
the coterie’s communal property. Anyone who contributes to the pool (no matter how much he contributes)
has equal access to it. Even if the character donates to
only one of the pool’s associated Backgrounds, he still
has equal access to it. Not everyone can use the pool
simultaneously, though. A Herd pool of seven dots can
grant access only to the same, finite number of vessels.
Just how those points are split up depends on the circumstances and agreements between the characters.
Example: Four players decide that their characters are
forming a Background pool. Their anchor is Resources (the
thriving blood doll trade among jaded elders), and they wish
to get dots in Contacts (from the elders themselves), Domain (recognition of sovereign hunting grounds from the
elders for whom they’re providing fresh vessels), and Retainers (a few lackeys who can move about by day). Jeff
contributes three dots of Resources; Michelle contributes
another two dots of Resources and two of Domain; Joe
contributes another two dots of Retainers, two to Contacts,
and one to Domain. Finally, Kelley — who is short on dots
— contributes only one dot of Retainers. This makes the
pool Resources 5, Contacts 2, Domain 3, Retainers 3. All
the players can have their characters tap this pool equally,
even Kelley, who contributed only a single dot.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, players can agree to
place individual access limits on shared Backgrounds,
to reflect any agreements their characters have made
with one another. Sometimes being the Kindred who
contributed fewer Backgrounds than the others comes
with its own considerations.

Upper Limits
By pooling points, a coterie can get Backgrounds that
surpass the normal five-dot limit. This arrangement is
normal, and it reflects the advantages of cooperation.
A group can secure a larger domain or maintain a larger network of allies and contacts than a single vampire
can. There is no absolute upper limit on the level to
which a pooled Background can rise, but things can
get downright ludicrous if you aren’t careful. It’s usu-

ally best for the Storyteller to impose a 10-dot limit on
the Anchor Background (and thus on all others).
The Storyteller should also take into consideration
the scaling of Backgrounds, increasing their reliability
rather than their quantitative value as the ratings escalate among the coterie. For example, if an average
player group of four players each contributes a single
dot or two to a shared Resources pool of 6, the effect
shouldn’t be that they’re collectively the world’s secret
Kindred billionaires, but rather that they’re of more
modest means, and that those means are more difficult
to wrest from them by other jealous vampires. This is
a question of balancing player expectations with elements of the story, so be sure to set some guidelines for
what the shared Backgrounds actually represent before
the chronicle begins.

Virtues
The Virtue Traits define a character’s outlook on unlife — they shape a character’s ethical code and describe his commitment to his chosen morality. Virtues
exist to help give a character a sense of being, not to
force players to portray their characters in a given way.
However, Kindred are passionate creatures, and sometimes an act or situation may force a character to consider exactly how she should react to a given stimulus.
Virtues come into play when a character faces an impending frenzy, does something ethically questionable
(according to the character’s morality), or confronts
something that terrifies or disturbs her.
A vampire’s Virtues are determined by his Path, the
particular code of ethics he follows. Most Camarilla
Kindred maintain their mortal values and follow the
Path of Humanity (referred to simply as “Humanity”),
but other vampires often subscribe to radically different philosophies. Humanity, Paths, and the alternate
Virtues are discussed in Chapter Seven.
At character creation, a character’s Humanity is
equal to his Conscience + Self-Control Virtues.

Conscience
Conscience is a Trait that allows characters to evaluate their conduct with relation to what is “right” and
“wrong.” A character’s moral judgment with Conscience
stems from her attitude and outlook. Conscience is
what prevents a vampire from succumbing to the Beast,
by defining the Beast’s urges as unacceptable.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Conscience factors into the difficulty of many rolls to
avoid committing a transgression. Additionally, Conscience determines whether or not a character loses
Humanity by committing acts that do not uphold her
moral code (see “Degeneration,” p. 309). A character
with a high Conscience rating feels remorse for transgressions, while a character with a lower Conscience
may be more callous or ethically lax.
Some vampires replace the Conscience Virtue with
the Virtue of Conviction (p. 314); unless your Storyteller tells you it’s OK to do this, assume Conscience is
used.

Self-Control
Self-Control defines a character’s discipline and mastery over the Beast. Characters with high Self-Control
rarely succumb to emotional urges, and are thus able to
restrain their darker sides more readily than characters
with low Self-Control.
Self-Control comes into play when a character faces
her Beast in the form of frenzy (p. 298). Self-Control
allows the character to resist the frenzy. Note: A character may never roll more dice to resist or control a
frenzy than she has in her blood pool — it’s hard to
deny the Beast when one’s mind clouds with hunger.
As with Conscience, Self-Control can be replaced,
in this case by the Virtue of Instinct (p. 314). Again,
unless the Storyteller specifically says it’s all right to do
so, assume Self-Control is used.

Willpower
Willpower measures a character’s inner drive and competence at overcoming unfavorable odds. Unlike other Traits,
Willpower has both a permanent rating and a temporary
pool of points. The rating is rolled or tested, while the
pool is spent. When a player spends a point of a character’s
Willpower, she should cross off the point from the Willpower pool (the squares), not the Willpower rating (the
circles). The rating stays constant — if a character needs
to roll Willpower for some reason, she bases the roll on the
permanent rating. The pool is used up during the story.
A character’s Willpower pool will likely fluctuate a great
deal during the course of a story or chronicle. It decreases
by one point every time a player uses a Willpower point to
enable his character to do something extraordinary, like
maintain self-control or gain an automatic success. Eventually, the character will have no Willpower left, and will no
longer be able to exert the effort he once could. A character
with no Willpower pool is exhausted mentally, physically,
and spiritually, and will have great difficulty doing anything,
as he can no longer muster the energy to undertake an action or cause. Willpower points can be regained during the
course of a story, though players are advised to be frugal
with their characters’ Willpower pools.
The Willpower Trait is measured on a 1-10 scale rather than a 1-5 scale. At character creation, a character’s
Willpower is equal to his Courage Virtue.

Courage
All characters have a Courage Trait, regardless of
the Path they follow. Courage is the quality that allows
characters to stand in the face of fear or daunting adversity. It is bravery, mettle, and stoicism combined. A
character with high Courage meets her fears head-on,
while a character of lesser Courage may flee in terror.

120

Kindred use the Courage Virtue when faced with circumstances they endemically dread: fire, sunlight, True
Faith. See the section on Rötschreck (p. 299) for mechanical systems dealing with character fear.

More information on Willpower is available in Chapter Six, under “Spending Willpower” on p. 266.

Blood Pool
A character’s blood pool measures how much vitae the
vampire has in his system. The blood pool comprises a
number of individual blood points. Each blood
point corresponds roughly to onetenth of the blood in an average
adult mortal (a pint or one-half
liter outside of a human).

A character at the Incapacitated health level is utterly immobilized and can take no action of any kind
except healing himself with blood points (if the character is a vampire or ghoul) or swallowing blood that
is offered to him. A mortal who reaches this stage is a
breath away from death; if she takes any more damage,
she dies. If a Kindred suffers an aggravated wound (see p.
285) after being Incapacitated, he dies the Final Death.
A vampire at the Incapacitated health level with no
more blood in his body immediately sinks into torpor.

The maximum number
of blood points a vampire
may ingest is dictated by his
Generation, as is the number of blood points he may
spend in a single turn. A vampire with zero blood points in his
system is ravenously hungry and likely
in the throes of frenzy.
More information on the blood pool
is available in Chapter Six, under “Using Blood Pool” on p. 268.

Health
The Health Trait measures a character’s physical condition, from perfect
health to Final Death. As characters are
wounded or otherwise impaired, they
lose health levels, then regain them as
they heal. A character’s Health Trait
consists of seven different “health levels,” and each level applies a different
dice pool penalty to any actions taken
by the person in question. A character
who is Hurt subtracts one die from her
action dice pools, while a Crippled character subtracts five dice from her action dice
pools. If health level penalties leave a character with no dice in a given dice pool, the character
cannot take that action. However, a point of Willpower can be spent to ignore wound penalties for one turn
(see p. 282).

Note
that dice
pool penalties from
health level loss
apply only to actions. They do not apply to purely reflexive
dice pools, such as soak
dice, most Virtue checks, or Willpower rolls
to abort to another action. If a character is
Wounded and suffers more non-aggravated damage, he
may still soak with his full Stamina (plus Fortitude, if he
has it). The health level penalties do apply to damage
rolls for Strength-based attacks, but not for mechanical
weapons like firearms. Ultimately, this rule must be adjudicated by the Storyteller and common sense.

Experience
During the course of a chronicle, characters — much
like players over the course of their lives — learn from
their mistakes and grow. Change is inevitable, even for
the eternal undead. Over years and centuries, vampires
hone their Disciplines, learn (and forget) the ins and
outs of cultures and languages, and refine their skills at
the Jyhad.
A great deal of what characters learn is beyond the
scope of any game system to reflect. In many cases the
more mundane aspects of growing older — and, one
would hope, wiser — are reflected in the players’ in-

122

creased confidence and perspicacity. Learning to lock
your car when you leave it in a public parking place
is simply common sense, not really a skill that can be
purchased. Emotional transformations are roleplayed,
not bought.
Sometimes, though, characters improve themselves
in skills magical or mundane. A system of rewards,
called experience points, is used to reflect these more
quantitative changes. Experience points reflect the
Traits that a vampire hones as time passes.
At the end of each story, the Storyteller awards experience points to each character. The players then write
down how many experience points the character has

CHAPTER THREE: CHARACTER AND TRAITS

earned. Between stories, players may spend their characters’ experience points to purchase or increase Traits.
Experience points can be used to improve Attributes,
to acquire new Abilities or enhance ones the character already has, to raise existing Disciplines or purchase
new ones, or to increase Virtues. Backgrounds may not
be purchased through experience points, though they
may be acquired through roleplaying if, for example,
the character makes a new friend, acquires a windfall,
or commits diablerie. The costs for all of these different
changes vary greatly, as shown on the chart on p. 124.
The Storyteller is the final arbiter of how many
experience points each character receives, as well as
which Traits may be raised. Accordingly, the Storyteller should oversee where experience points are spent.
Players may wish to put points into areas that don’t
honestly reflect what the character has learned during
the story or chronicle, in which case the Storyteller
can veto their actions. For example, if a character did
not use his Dominate Discipline at all during a story,
he could not have improved it, and thus the Storyteller
should not allow him to increase the number of dots
in that Discipline. The same stands for improving Virtues: A character who just killed three children and diablerized her sire has no logical grounds for increasing
her Humanity rating. Note that a character does not
have to use his Traits successfully to be eligible for an
increase. We often learn more from failure than from
success, and the undead are no different.
As Storyteller, try to be fair about experience-point
expenditure, and never take things to the point at
which the player feels he has no control over the character any longer. Ask the players what they feel their
characters learned before awarding any points, and use
that as part of the basis for giving them experience
points. These limitations are put forth to add a level
of reality to the game. If the changes in the character are completely random, the impact is lost. Weave
the changes into the course of events, and make the
changes reflect what has occurred.
Virtues increased by experience have no impact on
the character’s Humanity, Path, or Willpower. Once
the character-creation process is finished, that’s the
end of the matter. For example, a character who, during a story, manages to act in spite of his fear of fire is
eligible for a Courage increase, but increasing Courage
does not automatically increase Willpower.
No Trait may be increased by more than one point
during the course of a story. Vast changes in Traits take
time, and the game should reflect that limitation.

New Traits
Increasing existing Traits can be done fairly readily, so long as the character uses or practices the Trait
in question. Learning new Traits, however, is a little
more difficult. Even a vampire can’t simply pick up
a functioning legal knowledge or learn to fight if he
doesn’t know even the basics (to say nothing of learning a new Discipline). Thus, learning an entirely new
Ability or Discipline requires some tutoring and study,
in addition to the required experience-point expenditure. This study can be simple (a night-school course
to learn the basics of Computer) or brutally difficult
(months or even years of mind-bending rituals, formulas, and blood manipulation to learn the first dot in
Thaumaturgy), but it must always be accomplished.
Having the Mentor Background helps, but even a
mentor can teach only what she herself knows.
Storytellers: Do not allow players to neglect this requirement! Particularly for more esoteric arts such as
Disciplines, pursuit of new knowledge — and payment
for same — can lead to all manner of incredible stories.

Awarding Experience Points
Awarding experience points is a double-edged sword.
As a Storyteller, you can hurt your chronicle by giving
away too many as well as too few. If you give more to some
players than you do to others, you might seem as if you’re
playing favorites, and you also risk unbalancing the game.
However, the characters who do the most, who take the
risks and learn from their mistakes instead of simply sitting on the sidelines, deserve the experience points to reflect the changes they’re going through. The rules below
should help you avoid most problems, but you should feel
free to experiment and fine-tune them to fit your needs.

End of Each Chapter
At the end of each game session, or chapter, you
should award the characters between one and five experience points. One point is awarded automatically,
simply because the character experienced the chapter’s
events. Despite ourselves, we tend to learn from the
follies of others as we do from our own.
One Point — Automatic: Each player gets one point
at the end of each chapter.
One Point — Learning Curve: Ask the player what his
character learned in the course of the night’s events. If you
agree with the answer, give the player one experience point.
One Point — Roleplaying: The player carried out
the role of her character well, not only entertainingly

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

123

but appropriately. The player performed as the character should in the circumstances. Truly inspired roleplaying might merit two experience points.
One Point — Heroism: On rare occasions even
vampires can truly behave as heroes, risking all to let
friends or even strangers escape from disaster or death.
If a character acts heroically and manages to survive,
he should be rewarded. Some players might try to take
advantage of this idea. Don’t let them. Stupidity and
suicidal behavior should not be mistaken for heroism.

Only a few points should be given this way, as they are
effectively “bonus points” for a job well done.
One Point — Success: The characters achieved all or
part of the goals they set out to accomplish. Even minor
victories can be rewarded if they pushed the game forward.
One Point — Danger: The characters survived
against harsh odds and grave dangers.

The End of the Story

One Point — Wisdom: The player, and thus the
character, came up with a brilliant plan or even a spontaneous strategy that enabled the coterie to survive
when it would likely have failed otherwise.

You might decide to give extra experience points at
the end of a story, if the players have done their part
and the characters have faced down substantial trials.

More points can be awarded if you decide they
should be, or if you want the characters to advance
more quickly than they currently are.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Chapter Four:
Disciplines
"When my energies first surged through me, I discovered how to move like
lightning, how to borrow the strength of the earth, how to be as stone.
These were like breathing once was to me."
- The Book of Nod
Disciplines are supernatural powers granted by the
Embrace, which vampires cultivate to bring to bear
against their foes and prey. These powers separate the
Damned from mortals, providing an incomparable mystical edge over those who would stand against them.
With Disciplines, a vampire can exert the strength of
a dozen men, force an enemy into thrall, ignite a fire
with a glance, or take the mantle of a beast. Even the
youngest Kindred, with a few token powers at his command, has an advantage over most threats, while the
elders, who have often mastered a fearsome breadth of
these potent gifts, can seem almost unassailable.
The origin of Disciplines is a Kindred mystery. Are
they a form of dark Biblical justice, bestowed upon
Caine and his get as a damnation-scourge? Are they
the wiles of a twisted natural world, taught by Lilith,
the mother of monsters? Are they simply predatory
advantages, intrinsic to the state of being Kindred?
Whatever the answer, learning and honing these supernatural powers is paramount to being able to face
undeath on a vampire’s own terms. After all, the other
forces at play in the Jyhad will be cultivating theirs….
Like other Traits, Disciplines are rated in progressive
dots. A rating of one dot indicates that the Discipline

Elder Discipline Powers (6+)
Discipline powers at a rating of 6 and higher
sometimes feature multiple powers at various levels; in such cases, the vampire increasing in power
simply chooses which one she wants. Some Disciplines have more options than others; usually, this
means there are more commonly known applications of those Disciplines. If the character wants
to purchase the other option or options later, she
can spend additional experience as if buying the
same dot in the Discipline again to acquire it.
Storytellers may also allow players to create their
own elder Discipline powers, if they desire.
It should be noted that 6-dot and higher
powers can be abused to stomp a well-crafted
chronicle into tiny little pieces. These potent
abilities are often difficult (but not impossible)
to acquire, so Storytellers should consider the
impact that high-level Disciplines might have
on their chronicles before allowing them at all.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

127

in question has barely been awakened, while a rating of
six dots or higher indicates mastery beyond the capacity of most neonates and even ancillae. As a character
increases her rating in a Discipline, she gains access
to the powers listed next to the appropriate number
of dots, as well as retaining access to lesser powers. As
with other Traits, Discipline levels of higher than five
dots are available only to those Kindred of Generations
seven and lower (see p. 270).
Note: Unless stated in the description, Disciplines
cost no blood or Willpower points to activate.

Advancing Disciplines
Players begin the game with three dots to
spend on their characters’ Clan Disciplines,
which are listed with each Clan description
in Chapter Two. Caitiff may place their three
dots on any Disciplines they like, subject to
the Storyteller’s discretion. Characters may
also acquire Disciplines other than those
commonly taught by their Clan, provided
they spend the proper freebie or experience
points and have access to a vampiric teacher
(again, subject to the Storyteller’s discretion). Learning a new out-of-clan Discipline
requires that the teacher feeds the student a
point of their blood before instruction begins,
to start the mystical tie to the Discipline being taught. Improving knowledge of a Discipline already known does not require such a
transfer (although some unscrupulous teachers may claim that it’s still necessary).
Storytellers may decide that certain Disciplines are more or less difficult to acquire, depending on their chronicle. For example, it’s
generally easier for a Kindred to learn a common power like Potence (which many Clans
share) rather than Thaumaturgy (which is
generally the domain of the Tremere and a
few other bloodlines), but a chronicle set entirely around the storming and acquisition of
a rogue Tremere chantry may find that Thaumaturgy is much easier to learn and acquire.

128

Animalism
The Beast resides within all creatures, from scuttling cockroaches to scabrous rats up through untamed
wolves and even powerful Kindred elders. Animalism
allows the vampire to amplify his intensely primordial
nature. He can not only communicate with animals,
but can also force his will upon them, directing such
beasts to do as he commands. As the vampire grows in
power, he can even control the Beast within mortals
and other supernaturals.
Beasts grow distinctly agitated in the presence of a
vampire who lacks this Discipline or the Skill of Animal Ken, often to the point of attacking or running
from the vampire. In contrast, vampires possessing
Animalism exude a dominant vibe to lower creatures,
which attracts them.
Animalism is commonly found with vampires of the
Gangrel and Nosferatu Clans. Manipulation and Charisma are important for the use of Animalism powers;
the stronger the vampire’s personality, the more influence he has over animals.

Storytelling Animals
It can be difficult for the Storyteller to use
animals as something more than a plot device
whenever a character tries to communicate
with them. It’s easy to fall back on monosyllabic speech and easily led creatures in order
to get the story moving along. And indeed,
animals are simpler than humans – they focus
on the present and are directed by instincts
instead of complex goals and elaborate
schemes. However, simple doesn’t necessarily mean stupid; animals need cunning and
perception to survive, and both can be of
great use to a vampire master. Storytellers can
make animals dynamic, interesting characters
that bring a lot to the chronicle, or they can
quickly gloss over the finer points of their
characterization to get back to the more pressing conflicts in the chronicle.
Statistics for certain animals are found in
Chapter Nine, p. 388.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

• Feral Whispers
This power is the basis from which all other Animalism abilities grow. The vampire creates an empathic
connection with a beast, thereby allowing him to communicate or issue simple commands. The Kindred locks
eyes with the animal, transmitting his desires through
sheer force of will. Although it isn’t necessary to actually “speak” in chirps, hisses, or barks, some vampires
find that doing so helps strengthen the connection
with the animal. Eye contact must be maintained the
entire time; if it’s broken, the Kindred must re-establish contact to continue communication.
The simpler the creature, the more difficult it becomes to connect with the animal’s Beast. Mammals,
predatory birds, and larger reptiles are relatively easy
to communicate with. Insects, invertebrates, and most
fish are just too simple to connect with.
Feral Whispers provides no guarantees that an animal
will want to deal with the vampire, nor does it ensure
that the animal will pursue any requests the vampire
makes of it. Still, it does at least make the creature better disposed toward the Kindred. The manner in which
the vampire presents his desires to the animal often de-

pends on the type of creature. A Kindred can often bully
smaller beasts into heeding commands, but he’s better
off couching orders for large predators as requests.
If the vampire successfully uses the power, the animal performs the command to the best of its ability and
intellect. Only the very brightest creatures understand
truly complex directives (orders dealing with conditional situations or requiring abstract logic). Commands that the animal does understand remain deeply
implanted, however, and guide its behavior for some
time.
System: No roll is necessary to talk with an animal, but the character must establish eye contact (see
p. 152) first. Issuing commands requires a Manipulation + Animal Ken roll. The difficulty depends on the
creature: Predatory mammals (wolves, cats, vampire
bats) are difficulty 6, other mammals and predatory
birds (rats, owls) are difficulty 7, and other birds and
reptiles (pigeons, snakes) are difficulty 8. This difficulty
is reduced by one if the character speaks to the animal
in its “native tongue,” and can be adjusted further by
circumstances and roleplaying skill (we highly recommend that all communication between characters and
animals be roleplayed).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

129

The number of successes the player achieves dictates
how strongly the character’s command affects the animal. One success is sufficient to have a cat follow an
individual and lead the character to the same location,
three successes are enough to have a raven spy on a
target for weeks, and five successes ensure that a grizzly
ferociously guards the entrance to the character’s wilderness haven for some months.
The character’s Nature plays a large part in how he
approaches these conversations. The character might
try intimidating, teasing, cajoling, or rationalizing. The
player should understand that he does not simply play
his character in these situations, but the Beast Within
as well.
Using this power cannot force an animal to do something against its nature, or to force a creature to risk
its life. While the aforementioned grizzly would stand
guard to the vampire’s haven and even fight for it, it
would not do so against obviously superior numbers or
something overwhelmingly supernatural. A predatory
bird might be convinced to harry a target, but would
definitely not hold ground. A docile dog or skittish cat
would have no problem with reporting something it
had seen, but it wouldn’t enter combat unless given no
other option — though it would likely agree to stand
and fight and then flee at the first opportunity, if a
harsh Kindred demanded it.

•• Beckoning
The vampire’s connection to the Beast grows strong
enough that he may call out in the voice of a specific
type of animal — howling like a wolf, shrilling like a
raven, etc. This call mystically summons creatures of
the chosen type. Since each type of animal has a different call, Beckoning works for only a single species
at a time.
All such animals within earshot are summoned, and
some percentage of them will heed the Beckoning if it
is successful. While the vampire has no further control
over the beasts who answer, the animals who do are
favorably disposed toward him and are at least willing
to listen to the Kindred’s concerns. (The vampire can
then use Feral Whispers on individual animals to command them, which may be at a decreased difficulty at
Storyteller discretion.)
System: The player rolls Charisma + Survival (difficulty 6) to determine the response to the character’s
call; consult the table below. Only animals that can

130

hear the cry will respond. If the Storyteller decides no
animals of that type are within earshot, the summons
goes unanswered.
The call can be as specific as the player desires. A
character could call for all bats in the area, for only the
male bats nearby, or for only the albino bat with the
notched ear he saw the other night.

A single animal responds.
One-quarter of the animals within

Half of the animals respond.

4 successes

All of the animals respond.

••• Quell the Beast
As the supreme predators of the natural world, Kindred are highly attuned to the bestial nature that dwells
within every mortal heart. A vampire who develops
this power may assert his will over a mortal (animal or
human) subject, subduing the Beast within her. This
quenches all powerful, strong emotions — hope, fury,
love, fear — within the target. The Kindred must either touch his subject or stare into her eyes to channel
his will effectively.
Mortals who lack the fire of their inner Beasts are
quite tractable, reacting to even stressful situations
with indifference. Even the most courageous or maddened mortal becomes apathetic and listless, while an
especially sensitive individual may suffer from a phobic
derangement while under the power’s influence.
Different Clans evoke this power in different ways,
though the effect itself is identical. Tzimisce call it
Cowing the Beast, since they force the mortal’s weaker
spirit to shrivel in fear before the Kindred’s own inner
Beast. Nosferatu refer to it as Song of Serenity, since
they soothe the subject’s Beast into a state of utter
complacency, thus allowing them to feed freely. Gangrel know the power as Quell the Beast, and force the
mortal spirit into a state of fear or apathy as befits the
individual vampire’s nature.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation if forcing down the Beast through fear, or Manipulation + Empathy if soothing it into complacency. The

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

difficulty of the roll is 7 in either case. This is an extended action requiring as many total successes as the
target has Willpower. Failure indicates that the player
must start over from the beginning, while a botch indicates that the vampire may not affect that subject’s
Beast for the remainder of the scene.
When a mortal’s Beast is cowed or soothed, she can
no longer use or regain Willpower. She ceases all struggles, whether mental or physical. She doesn’t even
defend herself if assaulted, though the Storyteller may
allow a Willpower roll if the mortal believes her life is
truly threatened. To recover from this power, the mortal’s player rolls Willpower (difficulty 6) once per day
until she accumulates enough successes to equal the
vampire’s Willpower. Kindred cannot be affected by
this power.
Though a vampire’s Beast cannot be cowed with this
ability, the Storyteller may allow characters to use the
“soothing” variation of this power to pull a vampire out
of frenzy. With three or more successes, the frenzying
vampire may roll again to pull herself out of frenzy, using the same difficulty as the stimulus that caused the
frenzy originally.

•••• Subsume the Spirit
By locking his gaze with that of an animal, the vampire may mentally possess the creature. Some elders believe that since animals don’t have souls but spirits, the
vampire can move his own soul into the animal’s body.
Many younger vampires think it a matter of transferring one’s consciousness into the animal’s mind. In either case, it’s agreed that the beast’s weaker spirit (or
mind) is pushed aside by the Kindred’s own consciousness. The vampire’s body falls into a motionless state
akin to torpor while his mind takes control of the animal’s actions, remaining this way until the Kindred’s
consciousness returns.
Some haughty Tzimisce eschew this power, considering it debasing to enter the body of a lesser creature.
When they do stoop to using it, they possess only predators. Conversely, Gangrel revel in connecting to the
natural world in this way. They delight in sampling different animals’ natures.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Animal
Ken (difficulty 8) as the character looks into the animal’s eyes (see sidebar on p. 152). The number of successes allows the character to employ some mental Disciplines while possessing the animal, as noted below.

Successes
1 success

Result
Cannot use Disciplines

2 successes
		

Can use Auspex and other sensory
powers

Can also use Dementation, 		
Dominate, and other powers of 		
mental manipulation

5 successes

Necromancy, Thaumaturgy, and

This power entwines the character’s consciousness
closely with the animal’s spirit, so much so that the
character may continue to think and feel like that animal even after breaking the connection. This effect
continues until the character spends a total of seven
nights or three Willpower points to resist and finally
overcome the animal nature. This should be roleplayed, though the character will be affected to a lesser
degree if the player chooses to spend Willpower.
At the end of any particularly exciting incident during possession, the player rolls Wits + Empathy (difficulty 8) for the character to retain his own mind. Failure indicates that the character’s mind returns to his
own body, but still thinks in purely animalistic terms.
A botch returns the character to his body, and also
sends him into frenzy.
The character may travel as far from his own physical
body as he chooses while possessing the animal. The
character retains no conscious connection with his
vampire body during this time, though. The vampire
may also venture out during the day, albeit in the animal’s body. However, the character’s own body must
be awake to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain
awake (see p. 262). If the character leaves the animal’s
body (by choice, if his body falls asleep, or after sustaining significant injury), the vampire’s consciousness
returns to his physical form instantaneously.
Although the vampire has no conscious link to his
body while possessing the animal, he does form a sympathetic bond. Anything the animal feels, the vampire
also experiences, from pleasure to pain. In fact, any
damage the animal’s body sustains is also applied to the
character’s body, though the Kindred body may soak
as normal. If the animal dies before the vampire’s soul
can flee from the body, the character’s body falls into

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

131

torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to
the massive trauma of death, but some Kindred believe
that the vampire’s soul is cast adrift during this time
and must find its way back to the body.

••••• Drawing Out the Beast
At this level of Animalism, the Kindred has a keen
understanding of the Beast Within, and is able to release his feral urges upon another mortal or vampire.
The recipient of the vampire’s Beast is instantly overcome by frenzy. This is an unnatural frenzy, however,
as the victim is channeling the Kindred’s own fury. As
such, the vampire’s own behavior, expressions, and
even speech patterns are evident in the subject’s savage actions.
Gangrel and Tzimisce are especially fond of unleashing their Beasts onto others. Gangrel do so to stir their
ghouls into inspired heights of savagery during combat.
Tzimisce care less about who receives their Beast than
retaining their own composure.
System: The player must announce his preferred target (since it must be someone within sight, Drawing
Out the Beast cannot be used if the vampire is alone),
then roll Manipulation + Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8). Refer to the table below for the results:

Alternatively, the character may act

3+ successes The character transfers the Beast
		
successfully.
If the attempt fails, the character himself immediately enters frenzy. As the character relaxes in expectation of relieving his savage urges, the Beast takes that
opportunity to dig deeper. In this case, the frenzy lasts
twice as long as normal and is twice as difficult to shrug
off; its severity also increases exponentially. Botching this roll is even more catastrophic; the heightened
frenzy grows so extreme that not even expending Will-

132

power curbs its duration or effects. The character is a
hapless victim to the terrible fury of his Beast, and may
well hurl herself into a savage, flesh-rending rampage
that leaves the Masquerade (and unfortunate nearby
onlookers) in tatters.
If the character leaves the target’s presence before
the frenzy expends itself, the vampire loses his Beast,
perhaps permanently. While no longer vulnerable to
frenzy, the character cannot use or regain Willpower
and becomes increasingly lethargic. To recover the
Beast, he must find the person who now possesses it
(who likely isn’t enjoying herself very much) and coax
the Beast into its proper vessel. The most effective way
to do so is to behave in ways that make the Beast want
to return — however, this isn’t a guarantee that it will
wish to do so. Alternatively, the character can simply
kill the host (thus causing the Beast to return to the
vampire immediately).

••••• • Animal Succulence
Most vampires find the blood of animals flat, tasteless, and lacking in nutritional value. Some Gangrel
and Nosferatu, however, have refined their understanding of the spirits of such “lesser prey” to the point
that they are able to draw much more sustenance from
beasts than normal Kindred can. This power does not
allow an elder to subsist solely on the blood of animals,
but it does allow him to go for extended periods of time
without taking vitae from humans or other Kindred.
System: No roll is needed; once learned, this power
is always in effect. Animal Succulence allows a character to count each blood point drawn from an animal as
two in her blood pool. This does not increase the size
of the vampire’s blood pool, just the nutritional value
of animal blood.
Animal Succulence does not allow a character to
completely ignore his craving for the blood of “higher”
prey; in fact, it heightens his desire for “real food.” Every three times (rounded down) the character drinks
from an animal, a cumulative +1 difficulty is applied
to the next Self-Control/Instinct roll the player makes
when the character is confronted with the possibility
of dining on human or Kindred blood.
Animal Succulence does not increase the blood
point value of the blood of other supernatural creatures
(Gangrel, werecreatures, and so on) who have taken
animal forms, nor does it change the vampire’s feeding
preferences (such as the Ventrue have).

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••••• • Shared Soul
This power allows a character to probe the mind of
any one animal she touches. Shared Soul can be very
disconcerting to both parties involved, as each participant is completely immersed in the thoughts and
emotions of the other. With enough effort or time,
each participant can gain a complete understanding of
the other’s mind. Shared Soul is most often used to
extract an animal’s memories of a specific event, but
some Gangrel use this power as a tool in the search
for enlightenment, feeling they come to a better understanding of their own Beasts through rapport with
true beasts. Too close of a bond, however, can leave
the two souls entangled after the sharing ends, causing
the vampire to adopt mannerisms, behavior patterns,
or even ethics (or lack thereof) similar to those of the
animal.
System: The character touches the intended subject
creature, and the player rolls Perception + Animal Ken
(difficulty 6). The player spends a Willpower point for
every turn past the first that contact is maintained. Locating a specific memory takes six turns, minus one turn
for every success on the roll. A complete bond takes 10
turns, minus one turn for every success on the roll. A
botch on this roll may, at the Storyteller’s discretion,
send the vampire into a frenzy or give the character a
derangement related to the behavior patterns of the
animal (extreme cowardice if the vampire contacted
the soul of mouse, bloodlust if the subject was a rabid
dog, and so forth).

••••• • Species Speech
The basic power Feral Whispers (Animalism 1) allows character to communicate with only one animal
at a time. With Species Speech, a character can enter
into psychic communion with all creatures of a certain
species that are present. Species Speech is most often
used after an application of The Beckoning (Animalism 2), which can draw a crowd of likely subjects.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Animal
Ken (difficulty 7) to establish contact with the targeted group of animals. Once the character establishes contact, the player makes a second roll to issue
commands. There is no practical upper limit on the
number of animals that can be commanded with this
power, although all of the intended subjects must be in
the vampire’s immediate vicinity. Only one species of
animal can be commanded at a time; thus, if a character is standing in the middle of the reptile house at the
zoo, she could command all of the Komodo dragons,

all of the boa constrictors, or all of the skinks, but she
could not simultaneously give orders to every reptile
or snake present. Species Speech functions much like
Feral Whispers in all other respects.
Note: Players (and Storytellers) shouldn’t get too
wrapped up in species differences like northern diamondback rattlesnakes and south-eastern diamondback
rattlesnakes. At Storyteller discretion, the expenditure
of an additional Willpower point allows the character’s
commands to extend to members of a similar species to
the one initially commanded.

••••• •• Conquer the Beast
Masters of Animalism have a much greater understanding of both beasts in general and the Beast in
particular. Those who have developed this power can
master their own Beasts to a degree impossible for lesser
Kindred to attain. Conquer the Beast allows the vampire both to control her frenzies and to enter them at
will. Some elders say that the development of this power is one of the first steps on the road to Golconda.
System: The character can enter frenzy at will. The
player rolls Willpower (difficulty 7). Success sends the
character into a controlled frenzy. He can choose his
targets at will, but gains limited Dominate and wound
penalty resistance and Rötschreck immunity as per the
normal frenzy rules (p. 298). A botch on the roll sends
the vampire into an uncontrolled frenzy which Conquer the Beast may not be used to end.
The player may also roll Willpower (difficulty 9) to
enable the character to control an involuntary frenzy.
In this case, a Willpower point must be spent for every turn that the vampire remains in frenzy. The player
may make Self-Control/Instinct rolls as normal to end a
frenzy, but if the vampire runs out of Willpower points
before the frenzy ends, he drops into an uncontrolled
frenzy again. A botch on the Willpower roll raises the
difficulty of the vampire’s Self-Control/Instinct rolls by
two and renders Conquer the Beast unusable for the
remainder of the night.

••••• ••• Taunt the Caged Beast
Some Kindred are so attuned to the Beast that they
can unleash it in another individual at will. Vampires
who have developed this power are able to send adversaries into frenzy with a finger’s touch and the resultant momentary contact with the victim’s Beast.
The physical contact allows the vampire’s own Beast
to reach out and awaken that of the victim, enraging it
by threatening its territory.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

133

System: The character touches the target. The
player spends a Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty 7). The victim makes a
Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty 5 + the number
of successes); failure results in an immediate frenzy. A
botch causes the character to unleash his own Beast
and frenzy instead. This power maybe used on those
individuals who are normally incapable of frenzy, sending ordinary humans into murderous rages worthy of
the most bloodthirsty Brujah berserker.

••••• •••• Unchain the Beast
The self-destructive nature of Cainites can be turned
against them by an elder who possesses this formidable
power. With a glance, the vampire can awaken the
Beasts of her enemies, causing physical injury and excruciating agony as the victim’s own violent impulses
manifest in physical form to tear him apart from within.
A target of this power erupts into a fountain of blood
and gore as claw and bite wounds from an invisible
source spontaneously tear his flesh asunder.
System: The character makes eye contact (see
p. 152) with the intended victim. The player spends
three blood points and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty of the victim’s Self-Control/Instinct +
4). Each success inflicts one health level of aggravated
damage, which can be soaked normally. A botch inflicts one health level of lethal damage to the invoking
character for each “1” rolled. This damage can also be
soaked normally.

Auspex
Auspex gives the vampire uncanny sensory abilities.
She starts with the capacity to heighten her natural
senses significantly, but as she grows in power, she can
perceive psychic auras and read the thoughts of another
being. Auspex can also pierce through mental illusions
such as those created by Obfuscate — see the sidebar
“Seeing the Unseen” on p. 142 for more.
However, a vampire with Auspex needs to be careful.
Her increased sensory sensitivity can cause her to be
drawn in by beautiful things or stunned by loud noises or pungent smells. Sudden or dynamic events can
disorient an Auspex-using character unless her player
makes a Willpower roll to block them out (difficulty of
at least 4, although the more potent the source of distraction, the higher the difficulty). Failure overwhelms

134

the character’s senses, making her oblivious to her surroundings for a turn or two. While the Malkavians and
Toreador are more prone to these kinds of distractions,
the Tremere and Tzimisce aren’t immune.
Dots in Perception are very useful for using Auspex
powers, as more successes help the character gain more
sensory information.

• Heightened Senses
This power increases the acuity of all of the vampire’s senses, effectively doubling the clarity and range
of sight, hearing, and smell. While her senses of taste
and touch extend no farther than normal, they likewise become far more distinct; the vampire could taste
the hint of liquor in a victim’s blood or feel the give of
the board concealing a hollow space in the floor. The
Kindred may magnify her senses at will, sustaining this
heightened focus for as long as she desires. At the Storyteller’s option, this may make hunting easier.
Occasionally, this talent provides extrasensory or
even precognitive insights. These brief, unfocused
glimpses may be odd premonitions, flashes of empathy,
or eerie feelings of foreboding. The vampire has no
control over these perceptions, but with practice can
learn to interpret them with a fair degree of accuracy.
Expanded senses come at a price, however. Bright
lights, loud noises and strong smells present a hazard
while the vampire uses this power. In addition to the
possibility for distraction, an especially sudden or potent stimulus (like the glare of a spotlight or a clap of
thunder) can blind or deafen the Kindred for an hour
or more.
System: It takes a reflexive action to activate this
ability, but no roll or other cost is required. In certain
circumstances, dice rolls associated with using the
character’s sense (such as Perception + Alertness) decrease in difficulty by a number equal to the character’s
Auspex rating when the power is engaged.
The Storyteller may also use this power to see if the
character perceives a threat. In this case, the Storyteller privately rolls the character’s unmodified Auspex
rating, applying whatever difficulty he feels best suits
the circumstances. For example, sensing that a pistol is
pointed at the back of the character’s head may require
a roll of difficulty 5, while the sudden realization that
a rival for Primogen is planning her assassination may
require a 9. Note that even this “precognition” comes
only as a result of interpreting details the Kindred is

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

able to notice. It’s not an all-purpose insight or miraculous revelation.
At the character’s discretion, she may selectively
heighten one specific sense, rather than leaving them
all on. In these cases, the difficulty to perceive stimuli using that sense drops by one, but the difficulty to
avoid distraction or temporary bedazzlement increases
by one.
This power does not let characters see in pitch darkness, as does Eyes of the Beast (p. 199), but it does reduce difficulty penalties to act in such darkness from
+2 to +1, and the character may make ranged attacks
in pitch darkness if she can hear, smell, or otherwise
detect her foe.

•• Aura Perception
Using this power, the vampire can perceive the psychic “auras” that radiate from mortals and supernatural
beings alike. These halos comprise a shifting series of
colors that take practice to discern with clarity. Even
the simplest individual has many shifting hues within
his aura; strong emotions predominate, while momentary impressions or deep secrets flash through in streaks
and swirls.

The colors change in sympathy with the subject’s
emotional state, blending into new tones in a constantly dancing pattern. The stronger the emotions
involved, the more intense the hues become. A skilled
vampire can learn much from her subject by reading
the nuances of color and brilliance in the aura’s flow.
Aside from perceiving emotional states, vampires use
Aura Perception to detect supernatural beings. The
colors in Kindred auras, while intense, are quite pale;
mage halos often flare and crackle with arcane power;
the race of shapeshifters has strikingly bright, almost
frantic, auras; ghosts have weak auras that flicker fitfully like a dying flame; and faerie creatures’ radiance is
shot through with capricious rainbow hues.
System: After the character stares at the subject for
at least a few seconds, the player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty 8); each success indicates how much
of the subject’s aura the character sees and understands
(see the table below). A failure indicates that the play
of colors and patterns yields no prevailing impression.
A botch indicates a false or erroneous interpretation.
The Storyteller may wish to make this roll, thus keeping the player in the dark as to the veracity of the character’s interpretation.

The Aura Colors chart offers some example ideas
of common colors and the emotions they reflect that
Storytellers can use. Note that it is nearly impossible
to determine with certainty if a particular character is
lying or not with this power – vampires are inherently
deceitful by nature, but even mortals might react with
anxiety to questions while still being truthful. It is,
however, helpful in determine the target’s emotional
state, which might lead the vampire to decide that a
particular target is suspicious.
A character may choose to perform a very cursory
aura scan of a large area like a nightclub’s dance floor
or the audience in a gallery. In this case, the player
decides which characteristic of auras she’s looking for,
and that’s the only information she’s able to glean if
the roll is successful. (At the Storyteller’s discretion,
on this general scan roll, more successes on the roll
may more quickly yield what the character seeks.) For
example, the player may specify, “Who’s the most nervous person in attendance?” or “Are there any vampirically pale auras among the CEO’s entourage?” Thereafter, the player may narrow down her scrutiny of a
single individual, with an additional roll as normal.
The character may focus in on a particular subject’s
aura only once per scene with any degree of clarity.
Any subsequent attempts that result in failure should
be considered botches. It is very easy for the character
to imagine seeing what she wants to see when judging someone’s intentions. After 24 hours, the character
may try again at no penalty.
It is possible, though difficult, to sense the aura of a
being who is otherwise invisible to normal sight. Refer
to “Seeing the Unseen,” p. 142, for more information.

••• The Spirit’s Touch
When someone handles an object for any length
of time, he leaves a psychic impression on the item.
A vampire with this level of Auspex can “read” these
sensations, learning who handled the object, when he
last held it, and what was done with it recently. (For

these purposes, a corpse counts as an “object” and can
be read accordingly.) These visions are seldom clear
and detailed, registering more like a kind of “psychic
snapshot.” Still, the Kindred can learn much even
from such a glimpse. Although most visions concern
the last person to handle the item, a long-time owner
leaves a stronger impression than someone who held
the object briefly.
Gleaning information from the spiritual residue requires the vampire to hold the object and enter a shallow trance. She is only marginally aware of her surroundings while using The Spirit’s Touch, but a loud
noise or jarring physical sensation breaks the trance
instantly.
System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy. The
difficulty is determined by the age of the impressions
and the mental and spiritual strength of the person or
event that left them. Sensing information from a pistol used for a murder hours ago may require a 4, while
learning who owned a bloodstained puppet fashioned a
century ago might be a 9.
The greater the individual’s emotional connection
to the object, the stronger the impression he leaves
on it — and the more information the Kindred can
glean from it. Events involving strong emotions (a giftgiving, a torture, a long family history) likewise leave
stronger impressions than short or casual contact do.

At the Storyteller’s discretion, some impressions
on objects may be so strong — a knife plunged into
Caesar’s breast, the tip of the Spear of Destiny, a fang
pulled from the maw of Dracula — that any use of this
power may be deemed a success.

•••• Telepathy
The vampire projects a portion of her consciousness
into a nearby mortal’s mind, creating a mental link
through which she can communicate wordlessly or
even read the target’s deepest thoughts. The Kindred
“hears” in her own mind the thoughts plucked from a
subject as if they were spoken to her.
This is one of the most potent vampiric abilities,
since, given time, a Kindred can learn virtually anything from a subject without him ever knowing. The
Tremere and Tzimisce in particular find this power especially useful in gleaning secrets from others, or for
directing their mortal followers with silent precision.
System: The player rolls Intelligence + Subterfuge
(difficulty of the subject’s current Willpower points).
Projecting thoughts into the target’s mind requires one
success. The subject recognizes that the thoughts come
from somewhere other than his own consciousness,
though he cannot discern their actual origin without a
successful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equal
to the vampire’s Manipulation + Subterfuge).
To read minds, one success must be rolled for each
item of information plucked or each layer of thought
pierced. Deep secrets or buried memories are harder to
obtain than surface emotions or unspoken comments,
requiring five or more successes to access.
Reading thoughts with Telepathy does not commonly work upon the undead mind. A character may
expend a Willpower point to make the effort, making the roll normally afterward. Likewise, it is equally
difficult to read the thoughts of other supernatural
creatures. However, the character may project her
thoughts without expending a Willpower point. These
thoughts, however, are still obviously intrusions into
the target’s mind, but the character may attempt to disguise her mental “voice” with a roll of Manipulation +
Subterfuge (difficulty equals the target’s Perception +
Awareness) so the target doesn’t recognize her as the
“speaker.”
Storytellers are encouraged to describe thoughts as
flowing streams of impressions and images, rather than
as a sequence of prose (powers such as Telepathic Communication are of more use for that). Instead of making
flat statements like “He’s planning on killing his former

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

of visions: A couple kissing passionately in a doorway,
then the man walking alone at night; you suddenly see
your hands, knuckles white, wrapped around a steering wheel, with a figure crossing the street ahead; your
heart, mortal now and hammering with panic as you
hear the engine rev wildly; and above all, a blazing anger coupled with emotional agony and a panicked fear
of loss.” Such descriptions not only add to the story, but
they also force the player to interpret for herself what
her character gleans. After all, understanding minds —
especially highly emotional or deranged minds — is a
difficult and often puzzling task.

damage), or hurtling toward the desired destination so
forcefully that the silver cord snaps.

••••• Psychic Projection

An astral form may travel at great speeds (the Storyteller can use roughly 1000 miles per hour or 1500
kilometers per hour as a general guide) and carries no
clothing or material objects of any kind. Some artifacts
are said to exist in the spirit world, and the character
can try to use one of these tools if she finds one. The
character cannot bring such relics to the physical world
when she returns to her body, however.

The Kindred with this awesome ability projects her
senses out of her physical shell, stepping from her body
as an entity of pure thought. The vampire’s astral form
is immune to physical damage or fatigue, and can “fly”
with blinding speed anywhere across the earth — or
even underground — so long as she remains below the
moon’s orbit.
The Kindred’s material form lies in a torpid state
while her astral self is active, and the vampire isn’t
aware of anything that befalls her body until she returns
to it. An ephemeral silver cord connects the Kindred’s
psyche to her body. If this cord is severed, her consciousness becomes stranded in the astral plane (the realm of
ghosts, spirits, and shades). Attempting to return to the
vampire’s physical shell is a long and terrifying ordeal,
especially since there is no guarantee that she will accomplish the journey successfully. This significant danger keeps many Kindred from leaving their bodies for
long, but those who dare can learn much.
System: Journeying in astral form requires the player
to expend a point of Willpower and make a Perception
+ Awareness roll. Difficulty varies depending on the distance and complexity of the intended trip; 5 is within
sight, 7 is nearby or to a familiar location, and 9 reflects a
trip far from familiar territory (a first journey from North
America to the Far East; trying to shortcut through the
earth). The greater the number of successes rolled, the
more focused the character’s astral presence is, and the
easier it is for her to reach her desired destination.
Failure means the character is unable to separate
her consciousness from her body, while a botch can
have nasty consequences — flinging her astral form to
a random destination on Earth or in the spirit realm,
arriving in a place where the sun is active (necessitating a frenzy roll, although the sunlight doesn’t do any

138

The player may spend a point of Willpower to activate this power, and an additional point of Willpower to
gain the success necessary to perform the jaunt. This is
an exception to the normal rule where a player may not
spend more than a single point of Willpower per turn.
Each scene in Psychic Projection requires another
point of Willpower and a new roll. Failure indicates
that the vampire has lost her way and must retrace the
path of her silver cord. A botch at this stage means the
cord snaps, stranding the character’s psychic form in
the mysterious astral plane.

Interaction with the physical world is impossible
while using Psychic Projection. At best, the character
may spend a Willpower point to manifest as a ghostlike shape. This apparition lasts one turn before fading
away; while she can’t affect anything physically during this time, the character can speak. Despite lacking
physical substance, an astral character can use Auspex
normally. At the Storyteller’s discretion, such a character may employ some or all Animalism, Dementation, Dominate, Necromancy, Obtenebration, Presence, Thaumaturgy, and similar non-corporeal powers
she has, though this typically requires a minimum of
three successes on the initial Psychic Projection roll.
If two astral shapes encounter one another, they
interact as if they were solid. They may talk, touch,
and even fight as if both were in the material world.
Since they have no physical bodies, astral characters
seeking to interact “physically” substitute Mental and
Social Traits for Physical ones (Wits replaces Dexterity, Manipulation supplants Strength, and Intelligence
replaces Stamina). Due to the lack of a material form,
the only real way to damage another psychic entity is
to cut its silver cord. When fighting this way, consider
Willpower points to be health levels; when a combatant loses all of her Willpower, the cord is severed.
Although an astrally projected character remains in
the reflection of the mortal world, she may venture further into the spirit realms, especially if she becomes

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

lost. Other beings with particular sensitivity to psychic
activity, such as ghosts, werewolves, and even some
magi, travel the astral plane as well, and can interact
with a vampire’s psychic presence normally (although
the astrally projected character is not considered a
“ghost” for powers such as Necromancy). The observing character notices the astrally projecting vampire
with a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 8), requiring more successes than the Psychic Projection
activation roll. Even those who do notice you won’t
be able to identify you; you are merely an immaterial
shade hovering in the general area. Storytellers are encouraged to make trips into the spirit world as bizarre,
mysterious, and dreamlike as possible. The world beyond is a vivid and fantastic place, where the true nature of things is stronger and often strikingly different
from their earthly appearances.

begin their friends’ sentences. Prediction is a constant
low-level telepathic scan of the minds of everyone the
character is in proximity to. While this power does not
give the vampire the details of his neighbors’ conscious
thoughts, it does provide a wealth of cues as to the subjects’ moods, suppressed reflexes, and attitudes toward
the topic of conversation.

••••• • Clairvoyance

Telepathy (p. 137) allows a character to pick up only
the surface thoughts of other individuals, and to speak
to one at a time. With Telepathic Communication,
a character can form a more powerful link between
his mind and that of other subjects, allowing them to
converse in words, concepts, and sensory images at the
speed of thought (and without the need for Willpower
expenditure, unlike with Telepathy). Vampires with
this level of Auspex can act as “switchboard operators,”
creating a telepathic web that allows all participants to
share thoughts with some or all other members of the
network as they choose.

By using Clairvoyance, a vampire can perceive distant events without using Psychic Projection. By concentrating on a familiar person, place, or object, a
character can observe the subject’s immediate vicinity
while staying aware of her own surroundings.
System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty 6) and describes the target she’s trying to look
in on. If the roll is successful, the character can then
perceive the events and environment surrounding the
desired target for one turn per success. Other Auspex
powers may be used on the scene being viewed; these are
rolled normally. Clairvoyance does split the vampire’s
perceptions between what she is viewing at a distance
and what is taking place around her. As a result, while
using this power, a character is at +3 difficulty on all rolls
relating to actions that affect her physical surroundings.

and either participant in the discussion makes a Social
roll, the player may pre-empt the roll to spend a blood
point and make a Perception + Empathy roll (difficulty of the target’s Manipulation + Subterfuge). Each
success is an additional die that can be applied to the
player’s Social roll or subtracted from the dice pool of
the Social roll being made against the character.

••••• • Telepathic Communication

System: The player rolls Charisma + Empathy (difficulty equals the target’s current Willpower points) to
establish contact, although a willing subject may allow
the vampire access and thus obviate the need for a roll.
The maximum range at which a subject may be contacted and the maximum number of individuals who
may be linked simultaneously with this power depends
on the Auspex rating of the vampire who initiates contact (see sidebar).

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••••• •• Mirror Reflex
This power was developed by a Toreador elder who
made a fearsome reputation through her fencing prowess, acting as a hired champion in dozens of Ventrue
duels. Mirror Reflex is similar to Prediction in that it is
in essence a low-level telepathic scan of an opponent,
but this power taps into physical (rather than social)
reflexes, allowing the character to anticipate an enemy’s moves in personal combat.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Perception + the combat skill the opponent is using
(difficulty of the subject’s Manipulation + combat skill
in use). Each success is an additional die that can he applied to the character’s dice pools during the next turn
of combat for any actions taken against the scanned opponent. The use of Mirror Reflex does take one combat
action, and the power has a maximum range in yards or
meters equal to the character’s Willpower rating.

••••• ••• Psychic Assault
Psychic Assault is nothing less than a direct mindto-mind attack which uses the sheer force of an elder’s
will to overpower his target. Victims of Psychic Assault
show little outward sign of the attack, save for nosebleeds and expressions of intense agony; all injuries by
means of this psychic pressure inflicted are internal. A
medical examination of a mortal victim of a Psychic
Assault invariably shows the cause of death to be a
heart attack or aneurysm, while vampires killed with
this power decay to dust instantly, regardless of age.
System: The character must touch or make eye contact with his target. The player spends three blood
points (and a Willpower point, if assaulting a vampire
or other supernatural being) and rolls Manipulation +
Intimidation in a contested roll against the victim’s
Willpower. The result depends on the number of net
successes the attacker rolls.

damage (soaked normally).

unconscious for the rest of the night.
If he fails, the Psychic Assault kills
him instantly.

••••• •••• False Slumber
Possibly the source of many Malkavians’ conviction
that their sire is alive and well on the astral plane, this
power allows a Methuselah‘s spirit to leave his body while
in torpor. While seemingly asleep, the vampire is able to
project astrally, think, and perceive events normally.
System: No roll is needed. This power is considered
to be active whenever the vampire’s body is in torpor,
and astral travels are handled as per the rules for Psychic Projection. The vampire is not able to awaken
physically at will, however — waking from torpor is
handled per the normal rules for such an action (see
p. 283).
A vampire with this power whose silver cord is severed in
astral combat loses all Willpower points, as per the rules for
astral combat under Psychic Projection, but is not killed.
Instead, he loses the use of this Auspex power and half of
his permanent Willpower points. Both the Auspex 9 power
and the Willpower must be bought back with experience
points. The vampire’s soul slowly returns to his body over
the course of a year and a day, during which time he may
not be awakened from torpor by any means.

Celerity
Seeing the Unseen
Auspex enables Kindred to perceive many
things beyond the limits of lesser senses.
Among its many uses, Auspex can detect
the presence of a supernatural being who is
hidden from normal sight (a vampire using
Obfuscate, for example, or a ghost) or pierce
illusions created by the Discipline of Chimerstry. Note: “Normal sight” includes regular,
non-Auspex use of the Awareness skill.
• Obfuscate: When a vampire tries to use her
heightened perceptions to notice a Kindred
hidden with Obfuscate, she detects the subject’s presence if her Auspex rating is higher
than his Obfuscate, and she succeeds at a
Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty equals
7 minus the number of dots by which her
Auspex exceeds his Obfuscate). Conversely,
if the target’s Obfuscate outranks her Auspex,
he remains undiscovered. If the two ratings
are equal, both characters make a resisted roll
of Perception + Awareness (Auspex user)
against Manipulation + Subterfuge (Obfuscate
user). The difficulty for both rolls is 7, and the
character with the most successes wins.
• Chimerstry: Likewise, vampires with
Auspex may seek to penetrate illusions created with Chimerstry. The Auspex-wielder
must actively seek to pierce the illusion (i.e.,
the player must tell the Storyteller that his
character is trying to detect an illusion).
The Auspex-user and Chimerstry-wielder
then compare relative ratings, per Obfuscate,
above. The process is otherwise identical to
piercing Obfuscate.
• Other Powers: Since the powers of beings
like magi and wraiths function differently
from vampiric Disciplines, a simple comparison of relative ratings isn’t applicable. To keep
things simple, both characters make a resisted
roll. The vampire rolls Perception + Awareness, while the subject rolls Manipulation +
Subterfuge. Again, the difficulty is 7, and the
character with the most successes wins.

142

Not all vampires are slow, meticulous creatures.
When needed, some vampires can move fast — really
fast. Celerity allows Assamites, Brujah, and Toreadors
to move with astonishing swiftness, becoming practically a blur. The Assamites use their speed in conjunction with stealth to strike quickly and viciously from
the shadows before they are noticed. Brujah, on the
other hand, simply like the edge that the power gives
them against overwhelming odds. The Toreador are
more inclined to use Celerity to provide an air of unnatural grace to live performances or for an extra push
to complete a masterpiece on time, but they can be
as quick to draw blood as any assassin or punk when
angered.
System: Each point of Celerity adds one die to every
Dexterity-related dice roll. In addition, the player can
spend one blood point to take an extra action up to the
number of dots he has in Celerity at the beginning of
the relevant turn; this expenditure can go beyond her
normal Generation maximum. Any dots used for extra
actions, however, are no longer available for Dexterity-related rolls during that turn. These additional actions must be physical (e.g., the vampire cannot use a
mental Discipline like Dominate multiple times in one
turn), and extra actions occur at the end of the turn
(the vampire’s regular action still takes place per her
initiative roll).
Normally, a character without Celerity must divide
their dice if she wants to take multiple actions in a
single turn, as per p. 248. A character using Celerity
performs his extra actions (including full movement)
without penalty, gaining a full dice pool for each separate action. Extra actions gained through Celerity may
not in turn be split into multiple actions, however.

Celerity 6+
Usually, elders progress in Celerity according to the
existing progression – more dots mean more dice and
potential actions a turn that are available, and levels
6 through 9 have those powers available at each level,
as normal. Similar to other Disciplines at level 6 or
higher, though, alternative powers exist. If the elder
wants to purchase an alternative power instead of the
typical progression (as per the sidebar on p. 127), she
can, but she forfeits the capacity an extra Dexterity die
and potential for an extra action to gain the special

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

power instead. She can go back later and purchase the
“normal” dot of Celerity later, as desired.
Note that it isn’t possible to “skip” levels of progression for the normal Discipline – an elder with Celerity
7 that buys Projective at level 6 needs to go back and
buy the normal level 6 power before getting the access
to his level 7 power that grants the capacity for up to
seven Dexterity dice or actions in a turn.

••••• • Projectile
Despite the fact that a vampire with Celerity moves
at incredible speeds, any bullets he fires or knives he
throws while in this state don’t move any faster than
they normally would. Scientifically minded Kindred
have been baffled by the phenomenon for centuries,
but more pragmatic ones have found a way to work
around it. Projectile enables a vampire to take his preternatural speed and transfer it into something he has
thrown, fired, or launched.
System: Projectile requires the expenditure of a blood
point. In addition, the player must decide how many
levels of his character’s Celerity he is putting into the
speed of the launched object. Thus, a character with
Celerity 6 in addition to Projectile could decide to put

three dots’ worth of speed into a knife he is throwing,
and use the other three dots as dice or potential extra
actions as per normal. Each dot of Celerity infused into
a thrown object becomes an automatic success to the
attack’s damage roll, assuming the weapon or projectile
actually hits.

••••• •• Flower of Death
In combat, speed kills. A proper application of Celerity in combat can turn even the meekest Cainite
into a walking abattoir. How much more deadly, then,
is a vampire with the ability to utilize his preternatural
speed to the utmost in combat? Flower of Death allows
a vampire to take his Celerity and apply it in full to
each hand-to-hand or melee attack he makes.
System: Flower of Death costs four blood points, but
the spectacular effect is well worth it. Once the power
is in effect, the vampire’s bonus dice for Dexterity rolls
get added to every dice pool for attack the character
makes (even if the roll doesn’t use Dexterity) until the
end of the scene. Further, even if the Kindred uses some
of his Celerity dots for extra actions during the scene,
these extra dice are still available. The effect is limited
to hand-to-hand or melee weapon attacks — firearms,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

bows, and other ranged weapons are excluded — but
does grant the attacker additional dice for damage rolls.
Flower of Death is not cumulative — it is impossible
to “layer” uses of the power over one another to create
astronomical dice pools.

dragons breathing fire or gravity working in reverse).
Sometimes, frequent targets of Chimerstry end up attempting to disbelieve everything around them, leading to derangements (and, quite often, to the amusement of the Ravnos).

••••• ••• Zephyr

• Ignis Fatuus

Zephyr produces an effect vaguely similar to one of
the legendary comic book-style uses of enhanced speed,
allowing its practitioner to run so fast he can run across
water. Particularly successful applications of Zephyr allow a vampire to go so far as to run up walls and, in at
least one recorded instance, across a ceiling.
System: Zephyr requires the expenditure of one point
of blood and one point of Willpower. Unfortunately,
Zephyr requires such extremes of concentration that it
cannot be combined with any form of attack, or indeed,
with most any sort of action at all. If a character using
Zephyr feels the need to do something else while moving at such tremendous speeds, a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) is required. Needless to say, botches at Zephyr
speed can be spectacular in all the wrong ways.
Most times, a vampire moving at such a rate of speed
is barely visible, appearing more as a vampire-shaped
blur than anything else. Observers must succeed on a
Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7) to get a decent look at a Kindred zooming past in this fashion.

System: The player spends a point of Willpower
for the vampire to create this illusion. The volume of
smells, ambient lighting, smoke clouds, and the like
are limited to roughly 20 cubic feet (half a cubic meter) per dot the vampire has in Chimerstry. The illusion lasts until the vampire leaves its vicinity (such as
stepping out of the room) or until another person sees
through it somehow. The Cainite may also end the illusion at any time with no effort.

•• Fata Morgana

Chimerstry
The Ravnos are known as masters of illusion, although the reason why is lost to history. Rumors
abound of Ravnos ghûls, rakshasas, and shapeshifters,
but whatever its origins, Chimerstry remains a potent
and powerful weapon for the Deceivers. The Discipline
is, fundamentally, an art of conjuration that converts
the vampire’s will into phantoms that confound the
senses and technology alike. Even vampires fall under
the sway of the Ravnos’ illusory world, unless they have
a strong enough grasp of Auspex (see p. 142). The Ravnos often use this power to swindle and seduce their
victims into acts that work out badly for the victim
(but great for the Ravnos).
Illusions created by Chimerstry can be seen for what
they are by a victim who “proves” the illusion’s falsehood (e.g., a person who walks up to an illusory wall,
expresses his disbelief in it, and puts his hand through
it effectively banishes the illusion), and explicitly incredible illusions are seen as false immediately (e.g.,

144

The vampire may conjure a minor, static mirage that
confounds one sense. For instance, he may evoke a sulfurous stench, the appearance of stigmata, or the shatter of broken glass. Note that though tactile illusions
can be felt, they have no real substance; an invisible
but tactile wall cannot confine anyone, and invisible
razor-wire causes no real damage. Similarly, the vampire must know the characteristics of what he’s creating. While it’s easy enough to estimate what a knife
wound might look like, falsifying a person’s voice or a
photograph of a childhood home requires knowledge
of the details.

The Cainite can now create illusions that appeal to
all the senses, though they remain static. For example,
the vampire could make a filthy cellar appear as an opulent ballroom, though she could not create a glittering
chandelier or a score of graceful dancers. Again, the
illusion has no solid presence, though it’s easy enough
to fool an enraptured visitor with suggestions of what
she might expect. A bucket of brackish water is as cool
as chilled champagne, after all.
System: The player spends a Willpower point and a
blood point to create the illusion. These static images
remain until dispelled, in much the same way that an
Ignis Fatuus illusion does.

••• Apparition
Not really a power unto itself, Apparition allows a
vampire to give motion to an illusion created with Ignis Fatuus or Fata Morgana. Thus, the Cainite could
create the illusion of a living being, running water,
fluttering drapes, or a roaring fire.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

System: The creator spends one blood point to make
the illusion move in one significant way, or in any
number of subtle ways. For example, the vampire could
create the illusion of a lurking mugger lurching at her
victim, or she could create the illusion of a desolate
street, down which a chill wind blows trash while a
streetlamp flickers and hums. Taking complicated actions besides maintaining the illusion — that is, anything that would require a dice roll — first requires success on a Willpower roll, resulting in the dissolution of
the false construct if the roll fails.
Once the creator stops concentrating on the illusion,
it can continue in simple, repetitive motions – roughly
speaking, anything that can be described in a simple
sentence, such as a guard walking back and forth in
front of a steel door. After that, the vampire cannot
regain control over the illusion – she can either allow
it to continue moving as ordered, or let it fade as described under Ignis Fatuus.

•••• Permanency
This power, also used in conjunction with Ignis
Fatuus or Fata Morgana, allows a mirage to persist even
when the vampire cannot see it. In this way, Ravnos
often cloak their temporary havens in false trappings of
luxury, or ward off trespassers with illusory guard dogs.
System: The vampire need only spend a blood point,
and the illusion becomes permanent until dissolved
(including “programmed” illusions like those created
by Apparition).

••••• Horrid Reality
Rather than create simple illusions, the vampire
can now project hallucinations directly into a victim’s
mind. The target of these illusions believes completely
that the images are real; a hallucinatory fire can burn
him, an imaginary noose can strangle him, and an illusory wall can block him. This power affects only one
person at a time; though others can see the illusion, it
doesn’t impact them in the same way. Other people
can try to convince the victim that his terrors are not
real, but he won’t believe them. Note that targets with
enough dots in Auspex can still attempt to roll for Seeing the Unseen (p. 142).
System: A Horrid Realty illusion costs two Willpower points to set in motion and lasts for an entire
scene (though its effects may last longer; see below).
If the vampire is trying to injure his victim, his player
must roll Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty of the

victim’s Perception + Self-Control/Instinct). Each
success inflicts one health level of lethal damage on
the victim that cannot be soaked — the Cainite assaults the victim’s mind and perceptions, not his body.
If the player wishes to inflict less damage or change it
to bashing, he may announce a maximum amount of
damage before rolling the dice. Secondary effects (such
as frenzy rolls for illusory fire) may also occur.
The victim heals all his damage instantaneously if
he can be convinced that the damage he took was illusory, but convincing him may take some doing, such
as with at least two successes on a Charisma + Empathy
roll (difficulty equal to the Manipulation + Subterfuge
of the Cainite using Horrid Reality). The target must
be convinced of the attack’s illusory nature within 24
hours of its taking place, or it becomes too well established in his memory, and he will have to heal the damage using blood (if a vampire) or over time (if mortal).
This power cannot actually kill its victims (though a
target with a heart condition may well die from fright).
A victim “killed” by an illusory attack loses consciousness or enters torpor.

••••• • False Resonance
Illusions of living or unliving beings are all well
and good until someone decides to read the illusion’s
mind or its aura. The automatic failure to perceive any
sense of the target’s thoughts or emotions will usually
be passed off as bad luck, lack of concentration, or
whatever reason any Kindred might construct to explain why he didn’t succeed in gleaning information
through supernatural means. A vampire can use False
Resonance to overlay auras and thoughts on illusions,
as well as leave a trace that other emotionally resonant
powers can detect later.
System: This power automatically applies to any
other use of Chimerstry as the user wishes. In effect,
any attempt to use Auspex, the Dementation power
Eyes of Chaos, or similar sensory powers that generates
five or fewer successes will detect an aura, thoughts,
Demeanor or whatever the power would normally detect. Thoughts won’t be exceptionally complex, and
will relate to whatever is going on around the illusion
in a mundane and simplistic way. Auras will consist
of colors related to specific emotions (anger, sadness,
hatred, love, and happiness) and will not show much
complexity beyond that. Spirit’s Touch can pick up the
same emotional resonance until the next sunrise.

••••• • Fatuus Mastery
A Ravnos with Fatuus Mastery has no restriction
on how often she may use the first three levels (Ignis
Fatuus, Fata Morgana, and Apparition) and can maintain or control illusions with minimal concentration
or fatigue. Kindred who rely on the high cost of Chimerstry to limit a vampire’s ability to use illusions are in
for a very rude surprise when they encounter a Cainite
with this power.
System: Fatuus Mastery negates the Willpower and
blood cost for using the first three levels of Chimerstry.
In addition, the Kindred may direct movement for a
number of illusions equal to his Intelligence without
intense concentration. Furthermore, the character can
maintain the illusion as long as it remains within his
Willpower rating in miles (or about one and a half
times that in kilometers), although he may not make
it react to events around it if he has no way to perceive
those events.

••••• • Shared Nightmare
Even though Horrid Reality is visible to all onlookers, it can only inflict “damage” on one victim. With
Shared Nightmare, a vampire can inflict her tormented
visions on a crowd.
System: To use this power, the player must spend
two Willpower points, plus one blood point per target.
The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge once, but
compares the results against each target individually.
The difficulty is still each victim’s Perception + SelfControl/Instinct.

••••• •• Far Fatuus
This power allows a Kindred to project illusions to
any area he can see or visualize. Under most circumstances, accomplishing this requires him to have visited the location in question before he can project illusions there. Although more difficult, a vampire may
project illusions on the basis of a description, a photo,
or a video clip.
System: The difficulty for using Far Fatuus depends
on the user’s familiarity with the location. The player
must roll Perception + Subterfuge to affect the location. Once this roll is successful, the vampire may then
use any other Chimerstry power on that location.

••••• •• Suspension of Disbelief
A Ravnos with this power can imbue her Chimerstry
with a sense of reality that makes it easier for viewers to believe in the illusion. No matter how strange
or surreal the illusion is, an onlooker will accept it as
real. If the illusion is wildly unrealistic (fire-breathing
dragons, a pack of aliens), once it is no longer in his
sight, the observer will question what he saw and eventually deny the event ever happened. A vampire can
also use this power to make something appear unbelievable, whether it’s real or not. In this case, observers
will write off what they’re seeing as some kind of trick
or hallucination.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty 7). The number of successes determines
how many witnesses are affected. If the player uses the
power to make something look unbelievable, Auspex
will show the thing in question to be an illusion unless
the Auspex rating is not high enough to penetrate the
Kindred’s Chimerstry.

••••• ••• Synesthesia
A Cainite who masters this power can shuffle others’ senses around to suit his preferences. He can select one target and inflict a serious, disorienting, and
all-encompassing case of synesthesia upon her, making it impossible for her to interact meaningfully with
the real world for the power’s duration. The vampire
has complete control over how the target’s senses work
and can manipulate them to suit. For example, he may
decide that she smells all sounds as varieties of nauseating stenches, or more subtly, he may exchange pain for
pleasure. Used against a crowd, sensations are randomly shuffled, so one man will see what the woman next

to him sees, but hears what the man 15 feet behind him
hears and feels what the child a block away feels. The
end result is extremely disorienting for all victims.
System: When used against a single victim, the player must spend one Willpower point and roll Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty is victim’s current Willpower points). For use against crowds, the difficulty is
7, and the power affects everyone within the vampire’s
line of sight and subtracts one point from Perception
per success rolled. Victims whose Perception has been
reduced to zero can only sit down and wait for the disorientation to end. Duration against a single victim is

••••• •••• Mayaparisatya
This expression of Chimerstry allows the Cainite
to directly alter or create real objects or creatures, although such changes are of finite duration. A vampire
with this power can transform the air around a rival
Kindred into fire or render a locked door insubstantial.
A more harrowing use of this power enables the vampire to force an object out of existence by transforming
it into nothing more than a wisp of its former reality.
System: To use this power, the player must spend 10
blood points and one permanent Willpower point and
roll Manipulation + Subterfuge. Difficulty for the roll
is 6 for affecting inanimate objects, and the victim’s
Willpower rating for affecting characters. This power
can affect anything within miles (kilometers) of the
vampire, as long as the character is aware of the target
in some way. If used with Far Fatuus, the effects are
centered on the chosen location. This power can affect
a number of conscious targets equal to the Kindred’s
Willpower per use.
When dealing with inanimate objects, the number
of successes determines how drastic the alteration may
be. No matter how many successes the player rolls, the
duration is always a scene. This power can affect any
objects of a type within the vampire’s targeted area.

When using the power on conscious targets, consult
the table above for alterations (such as forcing the victim into another form or transforming her into a different substance). If using the power to negate the victim’s
existence, the power inflicts two levels of unsoakable
aggravated damage per success. If the power doesn’t kill
the victim, subtract one dot of Strength and Stamina
per success. The damage must be healed normally, but
the lost Attributes return at the end of the scene. Victims of this power look hazy and insubstantial. Victims
destroyed with this power simply vanish.

Dementation
Dementation is the Discipline that allows a vampire
to focus and channel madness into the minds of those
around him. Though it’s the natural legacy of the Malkavians, practitioners of Dementation need not actually be mad to use the Discipline… but it helps.
Disturbingly, Dementation doesn’t actually make
their victims mad, but rather it seems to break down
the doors to the hidden darkness of the target’s mind,
releasing into the open whatever is found there. The
Malkavians claim that this is because insanity is the
next logical step in mental evolution, a transhumanist advancement of what modern people consider consciousness. Other Kindred scoff that this reasoning is
an outright justification for the chaos that Dementa-

tion brings. They don’t scoff too loudly, however, lest
the Malkavian advance their consciousness next.

• Passion
The vampire stirs his victim’s emotions, either
heightening them to a fevered pitch or blunting them
until the target is completely desensitized. The Cainite may not choose which emotion is affected; she may
only amplify or dull emotions already present in the
target. In this way, a vampire can inflame mild irritation into quivering rage or atrophy true love into casual interest.
System: The character talks to her victim, and
the vampire’s player rolls Charisma + Empathy (difficulty equals the victim’s Humanity or Path rating).
The number of successes determines the duration of
the altered state of feeling. Effects of this power might
include one- or two-point additions or subtractions
to difficulties of frenzy rolls, Virtue rolls, rolls to resist
Presence powers, etc.

••• Eyes of Chaos
This peculiar power allows the vampire to take advantage of the fleeting clarity hidden in insanity. She
may scrutinize the “patterns” of a person’s soul, the
convolutions of a vampire’s inner nature, or even random events in nature itself. The Kindred with this
power can discern the most well-hidden psychoses, or
gain insight into a person’s true self. Malkavians with
this power often have (or claim to have) knowledge of
the moves and countermoves of the great Jyhad, or the
patterns of fate.

6+ successes Three months

•• The Haunting
The vampire manipulates the sensory centers of his
victim’s brain, flooding the victim’s senses with visions,
sounds, scents, or feelings that aren’t really there. The
images, regardless of the sense to which they appeal,
are only fleeting “glimpses,” barely perceptible to the
victim. The vampire using Dementation cannot control what the victim perceives, but may choose which
sense is affected.
The “haunting” effects occur mainly when the victim is alone, and mostly at night. They may take the
form of the subject’s repressed fears, guilty memories,
or anything else that the Storyteller finds dramatically
appropriate. The effects are never pleasant or unobtrusive, however. The Storyteller should let her imagination run wild when describing these sensory impressions; the victim may well feel as if she is going mad, or
as if the world is.

148

System: After the vampire speaks to the victim, the
player spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation +
Subterfuge (difficulty of his victim’s Perception + SelfControl/Instinct). The number of successes determines
the length of the sensory “visitations.” The precise effects are up to the Storyteller, though particularly eerie or harrowing apparitions can certainly reduce dice
pools for a turn or two after the manifestation.

System: This power allows a vampire to determine a
person’s true Nature, among other things. The vampire
concentrates for a turn, then her player rolls Perception
+ Occult. The difficulty depends on the intricacy of the
pattern. Discerning the Nature of a stranger would be
difficulty 9, a casual acquaintance would be an 8, and
an established ally a 6. The vampire could also read
the message locked in a coded missive (difficulty 7), or
even see the doings of an invisible hand in such events
as the pattern of falling leaves (difficulty 6). Almost
anything might contain some hidden insight, no matter how trivial or meaningless. The patterns are present in most things, but are often so intricate they can
keep a vampire spellbound for hours while she tries to
understand their message.
This is a potent power, subject to adjudication. Storytellers, this power is an effective way to introduce
plot threads for a chronicle, reveal an overlooked clue,
foreshadow important events, or communicate critical

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

information a player seeks. Important to its use, though,
is delivering the information properly. Secrets revealed
via Eyes of Chaos are never simple facts; they’re tantalizing symbols adrift in a sea of madness. Describe the
results of this power in terms of allegory: “The man
before you appears as a crude marionette, with garish
features painted in bright stage makeup, and strings
vanishing up into the night sky.” Avoid stating plainly,
“You learn that this ghoul is the minion of a powerful
Methuselah.”

•••• Voice of Madness
By merely addressing his victims aloud, the Kindred
can drive targets into fits of blind rage or fear, forcing
them to abandon reason and higher thought. Victims
are plagued by hallucinations of their subconscious demons, and try to flee or destroy their hidden shames.
Tragedy almost always follows in the wake of this power’s use, though offending Malkavians often claim that
they were merely encouraging people to act “according
to their natures.” Unfortunately for the vampire concerned, he runs a very real risk of falling prey to his
own voice’s power.
System: The player spends a blood point and makes
a Manipulation + Empathy roll (difficulty 7). One target is affected per success, although all potential victims must be listening to the vampire’s voice.
Affected victims fly immediately into frenzy or a
blind fear like Rötschreck. Kindred or other creatures
capable of frenzy, such as Lupines, may make a frenzy
check or Rötschreck test (Storyteller’s choice as to how
they are affected) at +2 difficulty to resist the power.
Mortals are automatically affected and don’t remember
their actions while berserk. The frenzy or fear lasts for
a scene, though vampires and Lupines may test as usual
to snap out of it.
The vampire using Voice of Madness must also test
for frenzy or Rötschreck upon invoking this power,
though his difficulty to resist is one lower than normal. If the initial roll to invoke this power is a failure,
however, the roll to resist the frenzy is one higher than
normal. If the roll to invoke this power is a botch, the
frenzy or Rötschreck response is automatic.

••••• Total Insanity
The vampire coaxes the madness from the deepest
recesses of her target’s mind, focusing it into an overwhelming wave of insanity. This power has driven
countless victims, vampire and mortal alike, to unfortunate ends.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

149

System: The Kindred must gain her target’s undivided attention for at least one full turn to enact this
power. The player spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty of her victim’s
current Willpower points). If the roll is successful, the
victim is afflicted with five derangements of the Storyteller’s choice (see p. 290). The number of successes
determines the duration.

On a botch… well, the Storyteller can decide what
a vampire inflicts upon herself by attempting to incite
the primal hells lurking within the darkest recesses of
a victim’s mind.
The victim (or the target of a botch) can spend a
number of Willpower points equal to the successes
rolled to end the duration prematurely. The Storyteller
decides when such Willpower points can be spent (such
as after a therapy session or after a friend has managed
to prove a particular delusion to be false).

••••• • Shattered Mirror
Although Dementation’s low-level effects are primarily to initiate or promote insanity rather than to
create it spontaneously, some of its more potent manifestations are not as subtle. The wielder of this fearsome power can transfer her own deranged mindset
into the psyche of a hapless victim, spreading her own
brand of insanity like a virus.
System: The vampire must establish eye contact
(p. 152) with her intended victim to apply this power.
The player then rolls Charisma + Subterfuge (difficulty
equal to the target’s current Willpower points) resisted
by the target’s Wits + Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty
equal to the Dementation user’s current Willpower
points). If the aggressor wins, the target gains all of her
derangements and Mental Flaws for a period of time
determined by the number of net successes the aggressor scored:

••••• • Lingering Malaise
While lesser Dementation powers allow a vampire to
inflict temporary (though often long-lasting) madness
upon a victim, elders of the Clan have developed the
ability to infect the minds of their victims with permanent maladies. Lingering Malaise causes permanent
psychological shifts within the victim, making him, as
one Gangrel elder remarked, “an honorary Lunatic.”
System: The character speaks to his victim for at
least a minute, describing the derangement that Lingering Malaise will inflict. The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty equal to the victim’s current
Willpower points); the victim resists with a Willpower
roll (using his permanent Willpower at difficulty 8). If
the user of Lingering Malaise scores more successes, the
victim gains a permanent derangement chosen by the
individual who inflicts it. Lingering Malaise may only
be used to inflict one derangement per night on any
given victim, though multiple attempts may be made
until the derangement takes hold.

150

••••• •• Restructure
The elder with this fearsome power has the ability
to twist his victims’ psyches at their most basic levels,
warping their very beings. The subject of Restructure
retains her memories, but her outlook on life changes
completely, as if she has undergone a sudden epiphany
or religious conversion. This effect goes much deeper
than the implantation of a derangement; it actually
performs a complete rewrite of the victim’s personality.
System: As the description says, this power allows
the vampire to change his target’s Nature to one more
suitable to his ends. To accomplish this, the character
must make eye contact (p. 152) with his intended victim. The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty equals the victim’s Wits + Subterfuge). If he rolls
a number of successes equal to or greater than the target’s Self-Control/Instinct, the target’s Nature changes
to whatever the player using Restructure desires. This

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

effect is permanent and can be undone only by another
application of Restructure (though subtle differences
from the character’s original Nature may still remain,
as it is impossible for such a fundamental change to occur flawlessly). A botch on this roll changes the character’s own Nature to that of his intended victim.

••••• ••• Personal Scourge
Similar to the Auspex power of Psychic Assault
(p. 141), this fearsome ability allows the elder to turn
the very strength of her victim’s mind against him,
inflicting physical harm with the power of his own
will. Victims of this self-powered attack spontaneously
erupt in lacerations and bruises, spraying blood in every direction and howling in agony. Those who have
observed such an attack with Auspex note that the
victim’s aura swirls with violent psychosis and erupts
outward in writhing appendages — a sight that can
make even the most jaded Tzimisce quail.
System: The vampire must touch or establish eye
contact (p. 152) with her target. The player rolls Manipulation + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’s
Stamina + Self-Control/Instinct) and spends two Willpower points. For a number of turns equal to the number of successes rolled, the victim rolls his own permanent Willpower as lethal damage against himself. This
damage can be soaked with his own Humanity or Path
of Enlightenment (difficulty 6); Fortitude does not add
to this soak dice pool, nor does body armor. He may
take no actions during this time other than thrashing
and gibbering; this includes spending blood to heal.

••••• •••• Lunatic Eruption
This fearsome ability is only known to have been
applied a few times in recorded Kindred history, most
spectacularly during the final nights of the last battle of
Carthage. It is effectively a psychic nuclear bomb, used
to incite every intelligent being within several miles
(kilometers) into an orgy of bloodlust and rage. It is
suspected that the Malkavians have used the threat of
this power as a bargaining chip in several key negotiations.
System: The player spends four Willpower points
and rolls Stamina + Intimidation (difficulty 8). The
area of effect is determined by the number of successes
scored:
Successes
1 success

Result
One city block

2 successes

An entire neighborhood

3 successes

A large downtown area

4 successes

Several neighborhoods

5 successes
		
		

An entire metropolitan area 		
(approximately 30 miles or 		
45 kilometers)

6+ successes An additional 10 miles or 15 		
		
kilometers for every success past 5
Within this area, all sentient creatures fall prey
to their baser instincts. Mortals spontaneously riot,
looting and burning between bouts of mass violence.
Kindred enter hunger-induced frenzies, draining dry
as many vessels as they can sink their fangs into. An
entire city can quite literally be driven temporarily insane by this power. Lunatic Eruption’s effects persist
until the next sunrise, and anyone entering its area of
effect (centered on the site at which it was used, not
on the character who applied it) falls under its spell.
However, momentum may carry the violence spawned
by this power much farther — and keep it going much
longer — than the power itself can force.
Victims of Lunatic Eruption may resist with SelfControl/Instinct rolls (difficulty equal to the Dementation user’s permanent Willpower rating); each success
provides one hour of lucidity, which most wise individuals use to leave the power’s area of effect (leaving the “blast radius” removes the power’s influence).
The source of Lunatic Eruption may be pinpointed if
a character is using Heightened Senses or an equivalent power at the time it is used; this is automatic and
requires no roll. However, this grants no knowledge of
what actually happened — the observer simply “feels”
a massive psychic shockwave explode from the character using the power.

Dominate
Dominate is one of the most dreaded of Disciplines.
It is a vampire’s ability to influence another person’s
thoughts and actions through her own force of will.
Dominate requires that the vampire capture her victim’s gaze (see p. 152); as such, it may be used against
only one subject at a time. Further, commands must be
issued verbally, although simple orders may be made
with signs — for example, a pointed finger and forceful expression to indicate “Go!” However, the subject
won’t comply if he can’t understand the vampire, no
matter how powerful the Kindred’s will is.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

151

Perhaps unsurprisingly, vampires to which Dominate
comes naturally tend to be from willful, domineering
Clans. The Giovanni, Lasombra, Tremere, and Ventrue all consider an iron will to be a boon, and are eager to impose that iron will on any who would move
against them.

Eye Contact
Many myths and stories exist about a vampire’s mystical ability to put people under her
spell by looking deeply into her victim’s eyes.
The persistence of such stories through the
ages isn’t surprising, since a number of Kindred Disciplines powers (most notably Dominate) require eye contact in order to work.
Other vampires, learning of this requirement,
have attempted everything from wearing mirrored sunglasses to gouging out their own eyes
in order to prevent an elder from exerting his
will upon them.
But Kindred are not so easily thwarted.
The need for eye contact stems from the aggressor Kindred’s need to see his victim’s soul,
and the eyes are the traditionally known as
the windows to the soul. While the vampire
needs to capture his target’s attention, the
target’s eyes need not be present for such
a power to work (although the arts of the
Tzimisce make this somewhat challenging at
times) — they only need to find the soul of
his victim laid bare.
A target trying to avoid eye contact can make
a Willpower roll against a difficulty equal to
Dominate user’s Manipulation + Intimidation (or other appropriate combination for
other Disciplines or specific situations, at the
Storyteller’s discretion). The difficulty may be
reduced for mitigating factors: -1 in the case
of the target obscuring his eyes slightly (such
as closing her eyes or wearing dark sunglasses)
up to a -3 for the eyes being completely unseen (such as with a thick blindfold or having
her eyes torn out). Ultimately, however, it is
up to the Storyteller to decide whether eye
contact is established in a particular case.

152

• Command
The vampire locks eyes with the subject and speaks
a one-word command, which the subject must be obey
instantly. The order must be clear and straightforward:
run, agree, fall, yawn, jump, laugh, surrender, stop,
scream, follow. If the command is at all confusing or
ambiguous, the subject may respond slowly or perform
the task poorly. The subject cannot be ordered to do
something directly harmful to herself, so a command
like “die” is ineffective.
The command may be included in a sentence, thereby concealing the power’s use from others. This effort at subtlety still requires the Kindred to make eye
contact at the proper moment and stress the key word
slightly. An alert bystander — or even the victim —
may notice the emphasis. Still, unless she’s conversant
with supernatural powers, the individual is likely to
attribute the utterance and the subsequent action to
bizarre coincidence.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equals the target’s current Willpower
points). More successes force the subject to act with
greater vigor or for a longer duration (continue running for a number of turns, go off on a laughing jag,
scream uncontrollably).
Remember, too, that being commanded to against
one’s Nature confounds the use of this power. Being
told to “sleep!” in a dangerous situation or “attack!”
in police custody may not have the desired effect, or
indeed, any effect at all.

•• Mesmerize
With this power, a vampire can verbally implant a
false thought or hypnotic suggestion in the subject’s
subconscious mind. Both Kindred and target must be
free from distraction, since Mesmerize requires intense
concentration and precise wording to be effective. The
vampire may activate the imposed thought immediately or establish a stimulus that will trigger it later. The
victim must be able to understand the vampire, though
the two need to maintain eye contact only as long as it
takes to implant the idea.
Mesmerize allows for anything from simple, precise
directives (handing over an item) to complex, highly
involved ones (taking notes of someone’s habits and
relaying that information at an appointed time). It is
not useful for planting illusions or false memories (such
as seeing a rabbit or believing yourself to be on fire). A
subject can have only one suggestion implanted at any
time.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

System: The player rolls Manipulation + Leadership (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower
points). The number of successes determines how well
the suggestion takes hold in the victim’s subconscious.
If the vampire scores one or two successes, the subject
cannot be forced to do anything that seems strange to
her (she might walk outside, but is unlikely to steal a
car). At three or four successes, the command is effective unless following it endangers the subject. At five
successes or greater, the vampire can implant nearly
any sort of command.
No matter how strong the Kindred’s will, his command cannot force the subject to harm herself directly
or defy her innate Nature. So, while a vampire who
scored five successes could make a 98-pound weakling
attack a 300-pound bouncer, he could not make the
mortal shoot herself in the head.
If a vampire tries to Mesmerize a subject before the
target fulfills a previously implanted directive, compare the successes rolled to those gained during the implanting of the first suggestion. Whichever roll had the
greater number of successes is the command that now
governs in the target’s behavior; the other suggestion is
wiped clean. If the successes rolled are equal, the newer
command supplants the old one.

••• The Forgetful Mind
After capturing the subject’s gaze, the vampire delves
into the subject’s memories, stealing or re-creating
them at his whim. The Forgetful Mind does not allow
for telepathic contact; the Kindred operates much like
a hypnotist, asking directed questions and drawing out
answers from the subject. The degree of memory alteration depends on what the vampire desires. He may alter the subject’s mind only slightly (quite effective for
eliminating memories of the victim meeting or even
being fed upon by the vampire) or utterly undo the victim’s memories of her past.
The degree of detail used has a direct bearing on how
strongly the new memories take hold, since the victim’s subconscious mind resists the alteration. A simplistic or incomplete false memory (“You went to the
movies last night”) crumbles much more quickly than
does one with more attention to detail (“You thought
about texting your girlfriend while you were in line at
the new movie theater, but you knew you’d have to
turn your phone off once you got inside. You liked the
movie well enough, but the plot seemed weak. You
were tired after it ended, so you went home, watched a
little late-night television, and went to bed.”).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

153

Even in its simplest applications, The Forgetful Mind
requires tremendous skill and finesse. It’s a relatively
simple matter to rifle through a victim’s psyche and rip
out the memories of the previous night without knowing what the subject did that evening. Doing so leaves
a gap in the victim’s mind, however — a hole that can
give rise to further problems down the road. The Kindred may describe new memories, but these recollections seldom have the same degree of realism that the
subject’s original thoughts held.
As such, this power isn’t always completely effective.
The victim may remember being bitten, but believe it
to be an animal attack. Greater memories may return
in pieces as dreams, or through sensory triggers like
a familiar odor or spoken phrase. Even so, months or
years may pass before the subject regains enough of her
lost memories to make sense of the fragments.
A vampire can also sense when a subject’s memories
were altered through use of this power, and even restore
them, as a hypnotist draws forth suppressed thoughts.
System: The player states what sorts of alteration he
wants to perform, then rolls Wits + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower points).
Any success pacifies the victim for the amount of time
it takes the vampire to perform the verbal alteration,
provided the vampire does not act aggressively toward
her. The table below indicates the degree of modification possible to the subject’s memory. If the successes
rolled don’t allow for the extent of change the character desired, the Storyteller reduces the resulting impact
on the victim’s mind.
Successes

May remove a single memory; 		
lasts one day.

permanently.

3 successes

May make slight changes to memory.

4 successes
		

May alter or remove entire scene
from subject’s memory.

5 successes
		

May reconstruct entire periods of
subject’s life.

To restore removed memories or sense false ones
in a subject, the character’s Dominate rating must be
equal to or higher than that of the vampire who made
the alteration. In that situation, the player must make
a Wits + Empathy roll (difficulty equal to the origi-

154

nal vampire’s permanent Willpower rating) and score
more successes than his predecessor did. However, the
Kindred cannot use The Forgetful Mind to restore his
own memories if they were stolen in such a way.

•••• Conditioning
Through sustained manipulation, the vampire can
make a subject more pliant to the Kindred’s will. Over
time, the victim becomes increasingly susceptible to
the vampire’s influence while simultaneously growing
more resistant to the corrupting efforts of other Kindred. Gaining complete control over a subject’s mind
is no small task, taking weeks or even months to accomplish.
Kindred often fill their retainers’ heads with subtle
whispers and veiled urges, thereby ensuring these mortals’ loyalty. Yet vampires must pay a high price for
the minds they ensnare. Servants Dominated in this
way lose much of their passion and individuality. They
follow the vampire’s orders quite literally, seldom taking initiative or showing any imagination. In the end,
such retainers become like automatons or the walking
dead.
System: The player rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower points)
once per scene. Conditioning is an extended action, for
which the Storyteller secretly determines the number
of successes required. It typically requires between five
and 10 times the subject’s Self-Control/Instinct rating. Targets with more empathic Natures may require
a lower number of successes, while those with willful
Natures require a higher total. Only through roleplaying may a character discern whether his subject is conditioned successfully.
A target may become more tractable even before
becoming fully conditioned. Once the vampire accumulates half the required number of successes, the Storyteller may apply a lower difficulty to the vampire’s
subsequent uses of Dominate. After being conditioned,
the target falls so far under the vampire’s influence that
the Kindred need not make eye contact or even be
present to retain absolute control. The subject does exactly as she is told (including taking actions that would
injure herself), as long as her master can communicate
with her verbally. No command roll is necessary unless the subject is totally isolated from the vampire’s
presence (in a different room, over the phone). Even
if a command roll fails, the target will still likely carry
out part of the orders given, simply because her master
wishes it.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

After the subject is fully conditioned, other Kindred
find her more difficult to Dominate. Such conditioning
raises others’ difficulties by two (to a maximum of 10).
It is possible, though difficult, to shake Conditioning. The subject must be separated entirely from the
vampire to whom she was in thrall. This period of
separation varies depending on the individual, but
the Storyteller may set it at six months, less a number
of weeks equal to the subject’s permanent Willpower
rating (so a person with 5 Willpower must stay away
from the vampire for just under five months). The
subject regains her personality slowly during this time,
though she may still lapse into brief spells of listlessness, despair, or even anger. If the vampire encounters
the target before that time passes, a single successful
Charisma + Leadership roll (difficulty of the target’s
current Willpower points) on the part of the vampire
completely reasserts the dominance.
If the subject makes it through the time period without intervention by her master, the target regains her
former individuality. Even so, the vampire may reestablish conditioning more easily than the first time,
since the subject is now predisposed to falling under
the Kindred’s mental control. New attempts require
half the total number of successes than the last bout of
conditioning did (which means the subject reaches the
threshold for reduced difficulties sooner, as well).

possessed in this way, although ghouls that have drunk
from the vampire using Possession can.
System: The vampire must completely strip away the
target’s Willpower prior to possessing her. The player
spends a Willpower point, then rolls Charisma + Intimidation, while the subject rolls his Willpower in a
resisted action (difficulty 7 for each). For each success
the vampire obtains over the victim’s total, the target
loses a point of temporary Willpower. Only if the attacker botches can the subject escape her fate, since
this makes the target immune to any further Dominate
attempts by that vampire for the rest of the story.
Once the target loses all her temporary Willpower,
her mind is open. The vampire rolls Manipulation +
Intimidation (difficulty 7) to determine how fully he
assumes control of the mortal shell. Similar to the Animalism power Subsume the Spirit, multiple successes
allow the character to utilize some mental Disciplines,
noted on the chart below. (Vampires possessing ghouls
can use the physical Disciplines the ghoul possesses,
but not the mental ones.)

At this level of Dominate, the force of the Kindred’s

Once the Kindred overwhelms the subject’s mind,
the vampire moves his consciousness into the victim’s
body and controls it as easily as he uses his own. The
mortal falls into a mental fugue while under possession.
She is aware of events only in a distorted, dreamlike
fashion. In turn, the vampire’s mind focuses entirely
on controlling his mortal subject. His own body lies
in a torpid state, defenseless against any actions made
toward it.
Vampires cannot possess one another in this fashion,
as even the weakest Kindred’s mind is strong enough
to resist such straightforward mental dominance. Only
through a blood bond can one vampire control another
to this degree. Supernatural creatures also cannot be

The character may travel as far from his body as he is
physically able while possessing the mortal. The vampire may also venture out during the day in the mortal
form. However, the vampire’s own body must be awake
to do so, requiring a successful roll to remain awake
(see p. 262). If the vampire leaves the mortal shell (by
choice, if his body falls asleep, through supernatural expulsion, after sustaining significant injury, etc.), his consciousness returns to his physical form in an instant.
Once freed from possession, the mortal regains mental control of herself. This can happen in an instant, or
the victim may lie comatose for days while her psyche
copes with the violation.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

The vampire experiences everything the mortal body
feels during possession, from pleasure to pain. In fact,
any damage the victim’s body sustains is also applied
to the character’s body (though the Kindred may soak
as normal). If the mortal dies before the vampire’s soul
can flee from the body, the character’s body falls into
torpor. Presumably this is in sympathetic response to
the massive trauma of death, though some Kindred believe that the vampire’s soul is cast adrift during this
time and must find its way back to the body.
The Kindred can remain in the mortal’s body even if
his own torpid form is destroyed, though such a pathetic
creature is not likely to exist for long. At each sunrise,
the vampire must roll Courage (difficulty 8) or be expelled from the body. If forced from the mortal body, the
vampire tumbles into the astral plane, his soul permanently lost in the spirit world. A vampire trapped in a
mortal body may not be “re-Embraced.” If the Embrace
occurs to such a creature, he simply meets Final Death.

••••• • Chain the Psyche
Not content with merely commanding their subjects,
some elders apply this power to ensure obedience from
recalcitrant victims. Chain the Psyche is a Dominate
technique that inflicts incapacitating pain on a target
who attempts to break the vampire’s commands.
System: The player spends a blood point when her
character applies Dominate to a subject. Any attempt
that the subject makes to act against the vampire’s
implanted commands or to recover stolen memories
causes intense pain. When such an attempt is made,
the Storyteller rolls the character‘s Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal to the subject’s Stamina +
Empathy). Each success equals one turn that the victim is unable to act, as she is wracked with agony. Each
application of Chain the Psyche crushes a number of
resistance attempts equal to the character’s Manipulation rating, after which the effect fades.

••••• • Loyalty
With this power in effect, the elder’s Dominate is so
strong that other vampires find it almost impossible to
break with their own commands. Despite the name,
Loyalty instills no special feelings in the victim — the
vampire’s commands are simply implanted far more
deeply than normal.
System: Any other vampire attempting to employ
Dominate on a subject who has been Dominated by a
vampire with Loyalty has a +3 difficulty modifier to his
rolls and must spend an additional Willpower point.

156

••••• • Obedience
While most Kindred must employ Dominate through
eye contact, some powerful elders may command loyalty with the lightest brush of a hand.
System: The character can employ all Dominate
powers through touch instead of eye contact (although
eye contact still works). Skin contact is necessary —
simply touching the target’s clothing or something she
is holding will not suffice. The touch does not have to
be maintained for the full time it takes to issue a Dominate command, though repeated attempts to Dominate
a single target require the character to touch the subject again.

••••• •• Mass Manipulation
A truly skilled elder may command small crowds
through the use of this power. By manipulating the
strongest minds within a given group, a gathering may
be directed to the vampire’s will.
System: The player declares that he is using this
power before rolling for the use of another Dominate
power. The difficulty of the roll is that which would be
required to Dominate the most resistant member of the
target group — if he cannot be Dominated, no one in
his immediate vicinity can. For every success past that
needed to inflict the desired result on the first target,
the player may choose one additional target to receive
the same effect in its entirety. The vampire needs to
make eye contact only with the initial target.

••••• •• Still the Mortal Flesh
Despite its name, this power may be employed on
vampires as well as mortals, and it has left more than
one unfortunate victim writhing in agony — or unable
to do even that. A vampire who has developed this
power is able to override her victim’s body as easily as
his mind in order to cut off his senses or even stop his
heart. It is rumored that this power once came more
easily to the Kindred, but modern medicine has made
the bodies and spirits of mortals more resistant to such
manipulations.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Medicine
(difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower
points + 2; a difficulty over 10 means that this power
cannot affect the target at all). The effect lasts for one
turn per success. The player must choose what function of the target’s body is being cut off before rolling.
She may affect any of the body’s involuntary functions;
breathing, circulation, perspiration, sight, and hearing
are all viable targets. While Still the Mortal Flesh is in

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

effect, a vampire can either stop any one of those functions entirely or cause them to fluctuate erratically.
The exact effects of any given bodily function being
shut off are left to the Storyteller. Most mortals panic
if suddenly struck blind, but only the shutdown of the
heart will kill a target on the spot. Vampires are unaffected by loss of heartbeat or breathing, but may be
rendered deaf and blind as easily as mortals.

••••• ••• Far Mastery
This refinement of Obedience (though the character
need not have learned Obedience first) allows the use
of Dominate on any subject that the vampire is familiar
with, at any time, over any distance. If the elder knows
where his target is, he may issue commands as if he
were standing face- to-face with his intended victim.
System: The player spends a Willpower point and
rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty equal to the subject’s Wits + Stealth) to establish contact. If this roll
succeeds, Dominate may be used as if the character had
established eye contact with the target. A second Willpower point must be spent in order for a vampire to use
this power on another vampire or other supernatural
being.

••••• •••• Speak Through the Blood
The power structures of Methuselahs extend across
continents and centuries. This power allows such ancients to wield control over their descendants, even
those far outside their geographic spheres of influence.
Speak Through the Blood allows an elder to issue commands to every vampire whose lineage can be traced
to her — even if the two have never met. Thus, entire broods act to further the goals of sleeping ancients
whose existences they may be completely unaware of.
The vampires affected by this power rarely act directly
to pursue the command they were given, but over a
decade or so, their priorities slowly shift until the fulfillment of the Methuselah‘s command is among their
long-term goals. Speak Through the Blood, because it
takes effect so slowly, is rarely recognized as an outside
influence, and its victims rationalize their behavior as
“growing and changing,” or something to that effect.

here

System: The player spends a permanent Willpower
point and rolls Manipulation + Leadership. The difficulty of this roll is equal to four plus the number of
Generations to which the command is to be passed.
Unless the character is aware of the location and present agenda of every descendant of his — a highly unlikely event — he may only issue general commands,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

157

such as “work for the greater glory of Clan Malkavian”
or “destroy all those who seek to extinguish the light
of knowledge.” Speak Through the Blood can be used
by a vampire in torpor. Commands issued through this
power last for one decade per success on the roll. Difficulties over 10 require one additional success for each
point past 10, making it that much more difficult to
issue long-lasting commands stretching down to the
ends of one’s lineage.
A vampire who has reached Golconda is not affected
by this power, and is completely unaware that it has
been used. Her childer, however, are affected normally
unless they are also enlightened. Ghouls of the victims
of this power are also affected, but to a lesser extent.

Resisting Dominate
Most victims cannot stand against the effects of Dominate. Still, there are situations
where this Discipline is powerless to sway the
subject.
• Mortals: Few mortals can hope to resist
Dominate, as their strength of will nothing
compared to the supernatural magnetism
of a vampire. Still, there are extremely rare
individuals who, due to strong religious
faith, unique psychic talent, or extraordinary
mental resolve, can shrug off this Discipline’s
effects. Only a foolish vampire ignores the
potential threat such human beings represent.
(See p. 372 for more information about True
Faith, for example.)
• Vampires: It is impossible to Dominate
another Kindred who is of stronger Blood.
The vampire must be of an equal or higher
Generation than the target for the powers to
be effective. Scholars of the Kindred condition suspect that this is one of the protections
Caine put in place to protect himself from
the whims of his willful childer. A faction of
those who believe this theory also maintain
that this implies that Caine himself employed
the Discipline of Dominate.
• Nature: A character’s Nature can have a
distinct impact on how easily Dominate influences her. A vampire might easily control
subjects with inherently empathic Natures

158

(Caregiver, Child, Conformist), while those
whose Natures denote a great degree of inner
strength (Bravo, Director, Rebel) can be more
of a challenge. The Storyteller may reduce
the required difficulty or number of successes
by one or two when the player rolls against
those subjects with “weaker” Natures, or
raise them by a similar amount for “stronger”
Natures. On the other hand, “strong” Natures might be more easiliy influenced to take
aggressive actions — for example, coaxing a
Rebel to denounce the Prince is likely easier
than goading a Conformist to do the same
thing. Ultimately, the Storyteller must adjudicate.
• Botches: If a Dominate roll botches, the
target is rendered immune to future attempts
by the same vampire for the rest of the story.

Fortitude
Although all vampires have an unnatural constitution
that make them much sturdier than mortals, Fortitude
bestows a resilience that would make an action movie
hero envious. Vampires with this Discipline can shrug
off agonizing trauma and make the most bone-shattering impact look like a flesh wound. The power even offers protection against the traditional banes of vampires,
such as sunlight and fire, and the Gangrel, Ravnos, and
Ventrue all find that edge incredibly useful.
System: A character’s rating in Fortitude adds to his
Stamina for the purposes of soaking normal damage
(bashing and lethal). A character with this Discipline
may also use his dots in Fortitude to soak aggravated
damage, though Kindred cannot normally soak things
like vampire bites, werewolf claws, magical effects, fire,
sunlight, or massive physical trauma. See p. 272, for
further details on soaking and damage.

Fortitude 6+
Elder vampires progress in Fortitude in the same way
as Celerity (see p. 142). They can increase their basic
mastery of the Discipline or to take an alternate power
such as one of those detailed below.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••••• • Personal Armor
Nobody likes to get hit, not even Cainites. The
easiest way to ensure that one is not hit (or shot, or
stabbed) repeatedly is to take the weapon with which
one is assaulted away from one’s attacker and break it.
That’s where Personal Armor comes in. This application of Fortitude, derived from one popular in the 12th
century, causes anything that strikes a Kindred who
employs Personal Armor to shatter on impact.
System: With the expenditure of two blood points,
a vampire can add preternatural hardness to his flesh.
Every time an attack is made on the Kindred using Personal Armor (one which he fails to dodge), his player
rolls Fortitude (difficulty 8). If the roll grants more successes than the attacker rolled, then the weapon used
to make the attack shatters against the vampire’s flesh.
(“Magical” weapons may be resistant to this effect, at
the Storyteller’s discretion.) The vampire still takes
normal damage if the attack is successful, even if the
weapon shatters in the process, though this damage
may be soaked. If the attack roll botches, any normal
weapon automatically shatters.
A hand-to-hand attack causes the attacker equal
damage to that suffered by the defender when Personal
Armor comes into play. If the attacker misses entirely,
she still takes one level of bashing damage.
The effects of this power last for the duration of the
scene.

••••• •• Shared Strength
It’s one thing to laugh off bullets, rather another to
watch the ricochets mow down everyone around you.
Many Kindred have wished, at one time or another,
that they could lend their monstrous vitality to those
around them. Those few vampires who have mastered
Shared Strength can — if only for a little while.
System: Shared Strength duplicates a portion of a
vampire’s Fortitude (one dot for every point of blood
the vampire spends) to another being. Activating the
power requires a Stamina + Survival roll (difficulty 8,
increased to 9 if the target is not a normal mortal), and
the expenditure of a point of Willpower. Furthermore,
the vampire must mark his target by pressing a drop of
his blood onto the target’s forehead. This stain remains
visible as long as the power is in effect, the duration of
which is determined by the initial roll.

The target of this power need not be willing to accept the benefit to receive it, and the bestowing vampire can end the effect at any time for no cost. Particularly sadistic Kindred have come up with any number
of ways in which a target’s “devil’s mark” and supernatural endurance can be used to land him in a great
deal of trouble.
A vampire can never bestow more levels of Fortitude
than he himself possesses.

••••• ••• Adamantine
Adamantine functions as a more potent version of
Personal Armor.
System: This power mimics the effects of Personal
Armor, save that the vampire who uses it takes no
damage from attacks that shatter on her skin.

Necromancy
Necromancy is both a Discipline and a school of
blood magic devoted to the command of the souls of the
dead. It’s similar to Thaumaturgy in that it has several
“paths” and accompanying “rituals” rather than a strict
linear progression of powers. The study of Necromancy
is not widespread among the Kindred, and its practitioners — primarily the Giovanni — are shunned and
despised for their foul practices (until those practices
become useful, of course).
Over the centuries, the various schools of vampiric
Necromancy have evolved and diversified from an earlier form of death magic, leaving several distinct paths
of necromantic magic available to Cainites. Nearly all
modern necromancers learn the Sepulchre Path first
before extending their studies to other paths. The primary Necromancy path increases automatically as the
character increases her overall Necromancy rating.
Other paths must be bought separately, using the experience costs for secondary paths.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

159

Like Thaumaturgy, Necromancy has also spawned a
series of rituals. While not nearly so immediate in effect as the basic powers of Necromancy, Necromantic
rituals can have impressive long-term effects. Unsurprisingly, the elements of Necromantic ritual are things
like long-buried corpses and hands from the cadavers
of hanged men, so obtaining suitable materials can be
quite difficult.
System: A Cainite necromancer must learn at least
three levels in his primary path before learning his first
level in a secondary Necromancy path. He must then
master the primary path (all five levels) before acquiring any knowledge of a third path.
As with Thaumaturgy, advancement in the primary
path costs the normal experience amount, while study
of additional Necromantic paths incurs an additional
experience-point cost (see p. 124). Because Necromancy
is not quite so rigid a study as Thaumaturgy is, the rolls
required to use Necromantic powers can vary from path
to path and even within individual paths. The commonly-learned Sepulchre Path is presented first, with the remaining paths presented in alphabetical order.
Statistics for ghosts may be found in Chapter Nine,
p. 385.

160

The Sepulchre Path
Through the Sepulchre path, the vampire can witness, summon, and command the spirits of the dead.
At higher levels, the necromancer can force the ghost
to remain in a particular place or object, or even damage wraiths directly. Since many other areas of Necromancy involve dealing with ghosts, this is the most
common path for necromancers to start with.
Note: If a Kindred uses a Sepulchre Path power in
the presence of something of great importance to the
ghost the power affects, the chances for success in the
summoning increase dramatically (reduce the difficulty
by 2). This might be the bathtub in which the ghost’s
mortal body was drowned, the rusted-out wreck of the
car where the ghost’s physical body was trapped alive,
or something unrelated to the ghost’s demise, such as a
favorite book or a child-ghost’s beloved nursery.

• Witness of Death
Before it is possible to control the dead, one must
perceive them. This power allows just that, attuning
a vampire’s unliving senses to the presence of the incorporeal.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Under its effects, a necromancer sees ghosts as translucent phantoms gliding among the living and hears
their whispers and moans. She feels the spectral cold
of their touch and smells their musty hint of decay. Yet
one cannot mistake the dead for the living, as they lack
true substance, and appear dimmer and less real than
creatures of flesh and blood. When a vampire uses this
power, her eyes flicker with pale blue fire that only the
dead can see.
Ghosts resent being spied upon, and more powerful
shades may use their own powers to inflict their displeasure on the incautious.
System: The player rolls Perception + Awareness
(difficulty 5). Success allows the vampire to perceive
ghosts as described for the rest of the scene (in the
mortal world — seeing ghosts in the land of the dead
requires Shroudsight, on p. 163). Failure has no special
effect, but a botch means the vampire can see only the
dead for the scene; everything else appears as shapeless,
dim shadows. While the vampire’s other senses remain
attuned to the living, he is all but blind in this state
and suffers a +3 difficulty to most vision-based Perception rolls and attacks. Ghosts notice the glowing eyes
of a vampire using this power only with a successful
Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 7).

•• Summon Soul
The power of Summon Soul allows a necromancer to
call a ghost back from the Underworld, for conversational purposes only. In order to perform this feat (and
indeed, most of the feats in this path), the vampire
must meet certain conditions:
• The necromancer must know the name of the
wraith in question, though an image of the wraith obtained via Witness of Death (see above), Shroudsight
(see p. 163), Auspex, or other supernatural perception
will suffice.
• An object with which the wraith had some contact
in life must be in the vicinity, though it need not be
something of significant importance to the ghost’s living consciousness. A piece of the ghost’s corpse works
well for this purpose (and even provides a -1 difficulty
modifier).
Certain types of ghosts cannot be summoned with
this power. Vampires who achieved Golconda before
their Final Deaths, or who were diablerized, are beyond
the reach of this summons. Likewise, many ghosts of
the dead cannot be called — they are destroyed, unable to return to the mortal plane, or lost in the eternal
storm of the Underworld.

System: The player spends one blood point and rolls
Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to 7 or the
ghost’s Willpower, whichever is higher). The vampire
must know the name of the ghost and have on hand an
object the ghost had contact with in life. Provided that
the target has died and become a ghost, success means
the shade appears before the necromancer as described
above. Not everyone becomes a ghost — it requires a
strong will to persevere in the face of death, and souls
that have found peace pass on to their eternal rewards.
Moreover, it is possible for the dead to suffer spiritual
dissolution and destruction after they become ghosts.
The Storyteller should consider all these factors when
deciding whether a particular ghost exists for a vampire
to summon.
Vampires know if their summons should have succeeded by a feeling of sudden, terrifying descent as they
reach too far into the great Beyond, so this power can
be used to determine whether a soul has endured beyond death. While a failure means the vampire wastes
blood, a botch calls a spirit other than the one sought
— usually a malevolent ghost known as a Spectre (see
p. 385). Such a fiend torments the one who summoned
it with every wicked power at its disposal.
Once a ghost is summoned, it may not deliberately
move out of sight of the vampire, though it can take
any other actions, including direct attack. The vampire’s player may spend a Willpower point to dismiss
the ghost at any time (unless he rolled a botch). Otherwise, at the end of the scene, shadows engulf the spirit
once more and return it to its original location.

••• Compel Soul
With this power, a vampire can command a ghost to
do his bidding for a while. Compulsion of the soul is a
perilous undertaking and, when used improperly, can
endanger vampire and wraith alike.
System: The vampire locates and approaches the intended ghost or calls it to his presence with Summon
Soul. As with the previous power, he must have the
ghost’s name and an object it handled in life. His player
then spends one blood point and rolls Manipulation +
Occult in a resisted roll against the ghost’s Willpower
(difficulty 6 for both rolls).
If the vampire wins, the number of net successes determines the degree of control he has over the ghost
(as described below). Moreover, the vampire’s control
keeps ghosts that have been called with Summon Soul
from returning to their original locations at the end of
the scene. If the ghost wins, the vampire loses a number

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

161

of Willpower points equal to the ghost’s net successes.
On a tie, the roll becomes an extended contest that
continues each turn until one side wins. If the vampire
botches at any point, the ghost is immune to any use
of the vampire’s Necromancy for the rest of the scene.
If the ghost botches, it must obey as if the vampire’s
player had rolled five net successes.

Result
The ghost must perform one simple
task for the vampire that does not
place it in certain danger. It must
attend to this task immediately, 		
although it can delay the 		
compulsion and pursue its own 		
business at a cost of one Willpower
point per scene. The ghost may not
attack the vampire until this task is
complete. It is possible to issue the
task of answering one question, in
which case the ghost must answer
truthfully and to the best of 		
its knowledge.

2 successes
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

The vampire may issue two orders
or ask two questions as outlined for
one success. Alternatively, the 		
vampire may demand a simple task
with a real possibility of danger, as
long as the danger is not certain. The
ghost may delay this compulsion with
Willpower.

3 successes
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

The vampire may issue three orders
as outlined for one success. 		
Alternatively, he may demand the
ghost fulfill one difficult and 		
dangerous task or a simple assignment
that has an extended duration of up
to one month. The ghost may delay
such orders with Willpower.

4 successes
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

The vampire may issue four orders,
as outlined for one success, or 		
assign two tasks, as for two successes.
Alternatively, the vampire may 		
command the ghost to perform one
complex assignment that puts the
ghost at extreme risk, or perform any
number of non-threatening tasks
as the vampire’s slave for up to one
month (or, if the necromancer spends
a permanent point of Willpower, for

162

		
		
		

a year and a day). It is possible for
ghosts to delay individual tasks, but
not put off enslavement.

5+ successes
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

The vampire may issue multiple
orders that have a sum complexity
or danger of five successes’ worth.
Instead, the vampire may order the
ghost to perform any one action that
it is capable of executing within one
month. Such a task can place the
ghost in immediate peril of 		
destruction, or even force it to betray
and assault loved ones. It is not 		
possible for ghosts to delay a task of
this magnitude with Willpower —
they must obey.

•••• Haunting
Haunting binds a summoned ghost to a particular
location or, in extreme cases, an object. The wraith
cannot leave the area to which the necromancer binds
it without risking destruction.
System: The player spends one blood point while
standing at the location for the haunting or touching
the intended prison. She then has the ghost brought to
her by whatever means she desires, though Summon
Soul is quickest and most reliable. Her player then
rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty is equal to the
target’s current Willpower points if resisted, to a minimum of 4; otherwise it is 4). The difficulty rises by one
if the vampire wishes to place the ghost in an object.
As usual, the difficulty decreases by one if the necromancer has a part of the spirit’s corpse in addition to
knowing its name (minimum difficulty 3).
Each success binds the ghost within the location or
object for one night. This duration extends to one week
if the player spends a Willpower point or a year and a
day for a dot of permanent Willpower. A wraith attempting to leave the area of a haunting must make an
extended Willpower roll (difficulty 9, four cumulative
successes necessary in a single scene) or take a level of
aggravated damage for each roll. If the wraith runs out
of health levels, it is hurled deep into the Underworld
to face destruction.

••••• Torment
It is through the use of this power that powerful necromancers convince bound ghosts to behave — or else.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Torment allows the vampire to strike a wraith as if he
himself were in the lands of the dead, inflicting damage on the wraith’s ectoplasmic form. The vampire
remains in the real world, however, so he cannot be
struck in return.
System: The player rolls Stamina + Empathy (difficulty equal to the wraith’s current Willpower points),
and the vampire reaches out to strike the wraith. Each
success inflicts a level of lethal damage on the wraith.
Should the wraith lose all health levels, it immediately
vanishes into what appears to be a doorway to some
hideous nightmare realm. Ghosts “destroyed” thus cannot reappear in or near the real world for a month.

The Ash Path
The Ash Path allows necromancers to peer into the
lands of the dead, and even affect things there. Of the
paths of Necromancy, the Ash Path is the most perilous to learn, because many of the path’s uses increase a
necromancer’s vulnerability to wraiths.

• Shroudsight
Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see through the
Shroud, the mystical barrier that separates the living
world from the Underworld. By using this power, the
vampire can spot ghostly buildings and items, the landscape of the so-called Shadowlands, and even wraiths
themselves. However, an observant wraith may notice
when a vampire suddenly starts staring at him, which
can lead to unpleasant consequences.
System: A simple roll of Perception + Awareness
(difficulty 7) allows a necromancer to utilize Shroudsight. The effects last for a scene.

•• Lifeless Tongues
Where Shroudsight allows a necromancer to see
ghosts, Lifeless Tongues allows her to converse with
them effortlessly. Once Lifeless Tongues is employed,
the vampire can carry on a conversation with the denizens of the ghostly Underworld without spending blood
or causing the wraiths to expend any effort.
System: To use Lifeless Tongues requires a roll of
Perception + Occult (difficulty 6) and the expenditure
of a Willpower point.

••• Dead Hand
Similar to the Sepulchre Path power Torment, Dead
Hand allows a necromancer to reach across the Shroud
and affect a ghostly object as if it were in the real world.
Ghosts are solid to necromancers using this power,

and can be attacked. Furthermore, the necromancer
can pick up ghostly items, scale ghostly architecture
(giving real-world bystanders the impression that he’s
climbing on air!), and generally exist in two worlds.
On the other hand, a necromancer using Dead Hand is
quite solid to the residents of the Underworld — and
to whatever hostilities they might have.
System: The player spends a point of Willpower and
makes a successful Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 7) to
activate Dead Hand for one scene. For each additional
scene the vampire wishes to remain in contact with
the Underworld, he must spend a point of blood.

•••• Ex Nihilo
Ex Nihilo allows a necromancer to enter the Underworld physically. While in the lands of the dead,
the vampire is essentially a particularly solid ghost. He
maintains his normal number of health levels, but can
be hurt only by things that inflict aggravated damage
on ghosts (weapons forged from souls, certain ghostly
powers, etc.). A vampire physically in the Underworld
can pass through solid objects in the real world (at the
cost of one health level) and remain “incorporeal” for
a number of turns equal to her Stamina rating. On the
other hand, vampires present in the Underworld are
subject to all of the Underworld’s perils, including ultimate destruction. A vampire killed in the realm of the
dead is gone forever, beyond even the reach of other
necromancers.
System: Using Ex Nihilo takes a tremendous toll on
the necromancer. To activate this power, the vampire
must first draw a doorway with chalk or blood on any
available surface. (The vampire may draw doors ahead
of time for exactly this purpose.) The player must then
expend two points of Willpower and two points of
blood before making a Stamina + Occult roll (difficulty 8) as the vampire attempts to open the chalk door
physically. If the roll succeeds, the door opens and the
vampire steps through into the Underworld.
When the vampire wishes to return to the real world,
he merely needs to concentrate (and the player spends
another Willpower point and rolls Stamina + Occult,
difficulty 6). At Storyteller discretion, a vampire who
is too deeply immersed in the Underworld may need
to journey to a place close to the lands of the living in
order to cross over. Vampires who wander too far into
the lands of the dead may be trapped there forever.
Vampires in the Underworld cannot feed upon
ghosts without the use of another power; their only
sustenance is the blood they bring with them.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

163

••••• Shroud Mastery
Shroud Mastery offers the Kindred the ability to
manipulate the veil between the worlds of the living
and the dead. By doing so, a necromancer can make
it easier for bound wraiths in his service to function,
or make it nearly impossible for ghosts to contact the
material world.
System: To exercise Shroud Mastery, the necromancer expends two points of Willpower, then states
whether he is attempting to raise or lower the Shroud.
The player then makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 9).
Each success on the roll raises or lowers the difficulties
of all nearby wraiths’ attempts to cross the Shroud in
any way by one, to a maximum of 10 or a minimum of
3. The Shroud reverts to its normal strength at a rate of
one point per hour thereafter.

The Bone Path
The Bone Path is concerned primarily with corpses
and the methods by which dead souls can be restored
to the living world — temporarily or otherwise.

• Tremens
Tremens allows a necromancer to make the flesh of a
corpse shift once. An arm might suddenly flop forward,
a cadaver might sit up, or dead eyes might abruptly
open. This sort of thing tends to have an impressive
impact on people who aren’t expecting a departed relative to roll over in his coffin.
System: To use Tremens, the necromancer spends
a single blood point, and the player must succeed on
a Dexterity + Occult roll (difficulty 6). The more successes that are achieved, the more complicated an action can be effected in the corpse. One success allows
for an instantaneous movement, such as a twitch, while
five allow the vampire to set up specific conditions under which the body animates (“The next time someone
enters the room, I want the corpse to sit up and open
its eyes.”). Under no circumstances can Tremens cause
a dead body to attack or cause damage.

•• Apprentice’s Brooms
With Apprentice’s Brooms, the necromancer can
make a dead body rise and perform a simple function.
For example, the corpse could be set to carrying heavy
objects, digging, or just shambling from place to place.
The cadavers thus animated do not attack or defend
themselves if interfered with, but instead attempt to
carry out their given instructions until such time as
they’ve been rendered inanimate. Generally it takes

Zombie Statistics
Corpses animated by a necromancer of the
Bone Path have Strength 3, Dexterity 2,
Stamina 4, Brawl 2, and always act last in
a turn (unless there are mitigating circumstances). They have zero Willpower points to
spend, but resist attacks as if they have Willpower ratings of 10. All Mental and Social
ratings are zero for a reanimated corpse, and
zombies never attempt to dodge. Zombies’
dice pools are not affected by damage, except
that caused by fire or the claws and teeth of
supernatural creatures. Most zombies have
10 health levels, but they are incapable of
healing any damage they suffer. They have
no minds or personalities to affect, so they are
immune to uses of powers such as Dominate
and Presence. Unless otherwise noted, they
likewise cannot be usurped from the control
of the necromancer invoking them.

dismemberment, flame, or something similar to destroy
a corpse animated in this way.
System: A roll of Wits + Occult (difficulty 7) and
the expenditure of a point of both blood and Willpower are all that is necessary to animate corpses with
Apprentice’s Brooms. The number of corpses animated
is equal to the number of successes achieved. The necromancer must then state the task to which he is setting his zombies. The cadavers turn themselves to their
work until they finish the job (at which point they collapse) or something (including time) destroys them.
Corpses animated in this way have no initiative of
their own, and are unable to make value judgments.
They respond to very literal instruction. Thus, a zombie could be told “sweep this room every day until all
the dust and cobwebs are gone” or “transcribe this
manuscript” with an expectation of reasonable results,
while a more open-ended command such as “fix this
motorcycle” or “research this Necromantic ritual and
write down the results” would be doomed to failure.
Bodies energized by this power continue to decay, albeit at a much slower rate than normal.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••• Shambling Hordes

•••• Soul Stealing

Shambling Hordes creates obvious results: reanimated corpses with the ability to attack, albeit neither very
well nor very quickly. Once primed by this power, the
corpses wait — for years, if necessary — to fulfill the
command given them. The orders might be to protect
a certain site or simply to attack immediately, but they
will be carried out until every last one of the decomposing monsters is destroyed.

This power affects the living, not the dead. It does,
however, temporarily turn a living soul into a sort of
wraith, as it allows a necromancer to strip a soul from
a living body. A mortal exiled from his body by this
power becomes a wraith with a single tie to the real
world: his now-empty body.

System: The player spends a point of Willpower.
The player then must succeed on a Wits + Occult roll
(difficulty 8). Each success allows the vampire to raise
another corpse from the grave, and costs one blood
point. If the player cannot or chooses not to pay the
blood point cost of additional zombies past a certain
number, the extra successes are simply lost. Each zombie can follow one simple instruction, such as “Stay
here and guard this graveyard against any intruders,”
or “Kill them!”
Note: Zombies created by Shambling Hordes will
wait forever if need be to fulfill their functions. Long
after the flesh has rotted off their mystically animated
bones, the zombies will wait and wait and wait, still
able to perform their duties.

System: The player spends a point of Willpower
and then makes a contested Willpower roll against
the intended victim (difficulty 6). Successes indicate
the number of hours during which the original soul is
forced out of its housing. The body itself remains autonomically alive but catatonic.
This power can be used to create suitable hosts for
Daemonic Possession. It has no effect on Kindred or
other supernatural creatures (except ghouls) until such
creatures are dead – in the case of vampires, this means
Final Death.

••••• Daemonic Possession
Daemonic Possession lets a vampire insert a soul into
a freshly dead body. This does not turn the reanimated
corpse into anything other than a reanimated corpse,
one that will irrevocably decay after a week, but it does

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

165

give either a wraith or a free-floating soul (say, that of
a vampire using Psychic Projection) a temporary home
in the physical world.
System: The body in question must be no more than
30 minutes dead, and the new tenant must agree to inhabit it — a ghost or astral form cannot be forced into a
new shell. However, most ghosts would gladly seize the
opportunity. Should the vampire, for whatever reason,
wish to insert a soul into another vampire’s corpse (before it crumbles to ash), the necromancer must achieve
five successes on a resisted Willpower roll against the
original owner of the body. Otherwise, the interloper
is denied entrance.
Note: The soul can use whatever physical abilities
(Athletics, Brawl, Potence) his new fleshy home possesses, and whatever mental abilities (Computer, Law,
Presence) he already possessed. He cannot use the
physical abilities of his old form, or the mental abilities
of his new one.

The Cenotaph Path
Practitioners of the Cenotaph Path are primarily
concerned with discovering or forging links between
the living world and the Shadowlands. It functions
on the principle that a Kindred, already a corpse, is
an unnatural bridge between the living and the dead,
and the necromancer can use this to find other, similar
linkages. The basic rudiments of the Cenotaph Path
function easily enough once the Kindred learns to attune himself to these connections. Advanced mastery
of the path usually entails some brief ritual to forge artificial connections, either through focusing unsavory
passions or commanding this world and the Shadowlands together.

• A Touch of Death
Just as a necromancer may exert mastery over the
Shadowlands, so too can some ghosts exert themselves in the mortal world. Whereas obvious displays
of ghostly power such as bleeding walls or disembodied
moans certainly won’t be mistaken, some ghostly abilities exert subtle effects that aren’t easily recognized.
A necromancer sensitized to the residue of the dead,
though, can feel whether an object has been touched
by a ghost or sense the recent passage of a wraith.
System: The necromancer simply touches a person or
object that he suspects is a victim of ghostly influence.
The player rolls Perception + Awareness (difficulty 6).
If successful, the necromancer can determine whether

166

a ghost has exerted any sort of power on the subject, or
even crossed nearby, to the duration detailed below.

On a failure, the necromancer receives no impressions. A botch reveals a misleading answer (an object
may seem tinged with ghostly power when it’s not, or
vice versa). Should the necromancer succeed in detection while touching an object or person that a ghost
is possessing, he immediately becomes aware that the
ghost is still inside. The impression gained in such a
case is sufficient to count as an image of the spirit for
purposes of the Sepulchre Path’s powers, so the Kindred may be able to (for example) immediately command a ghost to exit a person whom it possesses.

•• Reveal the Catene
Necromantic compulsions function much more effectively when the caster uses an object of significance
to the ghost in question. Such fetters tie the dead to
the living lands through their remembered importance
— a favored recliner for relaxing, a reviled piece of art
foisted off by hated relatives, or some object of similarly
intense emotion. Many necromancers can detect such
catene through the use of rituals (see Ritual of the Unearthed Fetter, p. 181). With this power, though, the
necromancer can determine a fetter with just a few moments of handling. The Kindred simply runs his hands
over the object and concentrates on it. He quickly
receives an impression of the item’s (or person’s) importance to wraiths, if any; should the wraith be one
known to the necromancer, he immediately recognizes
the object as a fetter to that (or those) ghost(s). Successful identification of a connected ghost is not exclusive; that is, if the vampire determines that the object
is important to a given wraith, he can also determine if
there are other ghosts tied to the item, though he must
use the power again to gain their identities.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Many necromancers use this power on objects already identified with A Touch of Death, in order to
determine whether the ghost is trying to attune a given
fetter or simply toying with the world of the living.

A botch stuns the necromancer into inaction for a full
turn and costs him a temporary Willpower point, as he
is overcome by shivers and a sense of overwhelming
despair.

System: The necromancer holds and examines the
object for at least three turns — if it’s an item, this
means turning it over in his hands, running his fingers along it, or otherwise giving it a critical eye; with
a person, this may require a more… invasive… examination. The player then spends a blood point and
rolls Perception + Occult (difficulty 7). If successful,
the Kindred determines whether the object holds any
significance to any ghost and, with three or more successes, the identity of at least one such ghost (which
allows the Kindred to use the Sepulchre Path on that
wraith, if desired). If the necromancer already knows
any of the ghosts involved, their ties are revealed with
their identity — so, if the necromancer already knows
a wraith well enough to summon and compel it with
other powers, successful identification of a fetter tells
whether the object is tied to that ghost, in addition to
any other impressions gained.

With three or more successes, the necromancer can
determine whether the Shroud’s strength has been artificially altered in the area.

If a botch is scored, the necromancer can never successfully use this power on the item being examined.

••• Tread Upon the Grave
The extended awareness granted with the Cenotaph
Path allows the necromancer to find locations where
the Shadowlands and the living world come close.
Often, the necromancer experiences a chill or shiver
when stepping into an area where the Underworld lies
near the living one. With practice, the vampire can
tell exactly where such locations are.
Experienced necromancers learn that certain locations are susceptible to ghostly influence; these haunted areas often become homes of a sort for ghosts. A
knowledgeable vampire can thus discover places where
the dead are likely to congregate, the better to snare
them with other Necromancy powers.
System: The player simply declares intent to sense
the Shroud in an area and makes a Willpower roll
(difficulty 8). Success reveals whether the location is
highly attuned to the Shadowlands, about average (not
particularly close to the world of the dead), or far removed from the realm of death. A failing attempt at
using the power has no adverse effect, though it may
be attempted only once per scene (so the necromancer
must either wait for a time or move to a different area
before attempting Tread Upon the Grave once more).

•••• Death Knell
Not all who die go on to become ghosts — many
lack the drive to hang on after death or simply have no
overwhelming needs that compel them to stick around.
Normally, even necromancers have no way to sort
those who might become ghosts from the masses who
go on to whatever rewards await. Over time, though, a
necromancer can become sensitized to the pull that occurs when a soul escapes from a body only to hover in
wait, enslaved by its desires. The weight of desperation
becomes like a tangible tug, and some necromancers
savor this emotion even as they follow the sensation to
find the new ghost.
Of course, actually discovering the new ghost can be
problematic. The Kindred may need some means to see
through the Shroud or may have to send other wraiths
to look for the new unfortunate, especially if a large
accident or massacre leaves too many corpses for the
necromancer to easily discern and test names.
System: Whenever someone dies and becomes a
ghost within a half-mile or kilometer of the necromancer, she automatically senses the demise (though many
choose to ignore this “always-on” power unless actively
seeking someone). This power does not automatically
pinpoint the location of the new ghost or identify it,
but the player may spend one Willpower point and roll
Perception + Occult (difficulty 7) for the necromancer
to gain a vague sense of the distance and direction to
the new wraith. With one success, the Kindred may
sense a vague pull in a general direction; with three
successes, the necromancer can sense the direction and
guess distance to within a quarter-mile or half a kilometer. With five successes, the necromancer immediately senses the location of the new ghost to within
one foot or 30 cm. A failure carries no penalty but a
botched attempt sends the necromancer scurrying off
in the wrong direction.
The Storyteller may rule that disturbances in the
Underworld, intervening magic, or other similar phenomena cloud this sensation, simply to prevent overburdening a chronicle with constant ghost-hunting
and dice rolling.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

167

••••• Ephemeral Binding
The most puissant necromancers learn not only to
sense the ties between living and dead, but to forge
such ties themselves. The master of Ephemeral Binding turns an otherwise mundane object or person into a
depository for his own necromantic energy. The undying Curse transforms the subject into a sort of linkage
between the living and dead. The necromancer smears
his blood on the item in question, which mystically absorbs the vitae and, in doing so, becomes a vessel to
anchor a spirit.
System: The necromancer must coat an object with
his blood (a full blood point’s worth); if the subject is
a person, then that individual must ingest the vitae.
The player marks off the blood point, spends a point
of Willpower, and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 8). If successful, the item temporarily becomes
a fetter to one wraith. If the Kindred already knows
the name of the wraith or has a strong psychic impression, then the object can become a fetter at any range,
even to a ghost who normally does not come near the
living world (so long as the ghost still exists). Otherwise, the necromancer must be able to see or sense the
ghost (with Witness of Death, Shroudsight, or other
such means).
A fetter artificially created in this fashion functions
for all necromantic and ghostly purposes as a normal
fetter: It can be detected with other Necromancy powers, the vampire gains a bonus to Necromancy against
the wraith attuned to it, and the ghost similarly finds
exertion of its powers easier upon the subject (so the
vampire might turn an unwitting ghoul into a consort
for a wraith familiar with possession…). The ghost can
sink into the fetter to heal; conversely, if the fetter is
destroyed, the wraith is banished to some inaccessible
region of the Underworld, perhaps never to return.
A fetter created with Ephemeral Binding lasts for
one night per success scored. The expenditure of an additional point of Willpower increases this duration to
a week per success, whereas spending a permanent dot
of Willpower extends the duration to a year and a day.
Botching with this power not only causes failure but
also makes the ghost immediately aware of what the
necromancer was trying to do. Most ghosts do not take
kindly to meddling Kindred trying to make artificial
chains for them.

The Corpse in the Monster
This path enhances the necromantic understanding
of the unliving form and allows the user to fully experience the corpse as a gateway between life and death.
The path lets the vampire apply some of a corpse’s
traits to a vampire, and she can enhance or reduce
these traits at various levels of the power.

Whither Mortis?
Lost Clans and bloodlines, such as the Cappadocians and the Lamia, had access to an
ancient Discipline known as Mortis. Some
Kindred scholars claim that Mortis and Necromancy are distinct Disciplines, but for ease
the three Mortis paths presented in this book
are listed as Necromancy paths. The Cappadocians (see p. 418) specialized in either the
Corpse in the Monster or the Grave’s Decay,
while the Lamia (see p. 422) generally took
the Path of the Four Humors as their primary
path. Rumors are that the Harbingers of Skulls
(see p. 402) in the Sabbat have relearned the
Corpse in the Monster and the Grave’s Decay,
claiming them collectively as the “Mortuus
Path,” but they still tend to follow most modern necromancers and choose Sepulchre Path
as their primary path before learning Grave’s
Decay or the Corpse in the Monster.

• Masque of Death
The character with this ability can assume a visage
of death or inflict that shape on another vampire. The
victim’s flesh becomes pallid and thin (if it is not already), and skin pulls tight against bone. This ability
can be very useful, as it allows one to hide in plain sight
in a tomb or crypt at any time (though the character
remains as vulnerable to sunlight and fire as ever).
When a necromancer uses this power on another Kindred, the victim gains the same corpselike demeanor.
In this sense, the ability works as something of a minor
curse.
System: The player spends one blood point for the
character to gain the form described. Those afflicted

168

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

with the Masque of Death lose two points of Dexterity and Appearance (minimum of 1 in Dexterity and
0 in Appearance) for the duration of the power. The
player also gets two extra dice to his Intimidation dice
pool, should he wish to terrify any onlookers. Further,
if the character remains perfectly still, observers must
roll five successes on a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty 7) to distinguish the character from a normal
corpse. The player doesn’t need to roll anything to
have the character stop moving — vampires have no
autonomic functions.
If the user inflicts Masque of Death on another vampire, he must spend a blood point, touch the target, and
then make a Stamina + Medicine roll (difficulty equal
to the target’s Stamina + 3). The Masque of Death lasts
until the next sunset, unless the character who created
the masque wishes to extinguish its effects earlier.

•• Cold of the Grave
The dead feel no pain, though most undead do. With
this ability, the character can temporarily take on the
unfeeling semblance of the dead, in order to protect
herself from physical and emotional harm. When assuming the Cold of the Grave, the vampire’s skin becomes unusually cold. When she speaks, her breath
mists even in warm air — those with exceptional senses might even see a slight red tinge to the breath.
The power brings a sense of lethargy over the character, as a mortal might feel under the influence of a
mildly unpleasant disease. It becomes difficult to rouse
oneself to action, and very little seems important
enough to really worry about. A corpse has no worries,
after all.
System: The player spends one Willpower point.
For the remainder of the scene, the character takes no
wound penalties, and the player gains an additional die
to all dice pools that involve resisting emotional manipulation, such as Intimidation or Empathy. However,
the player also loses a die from dice pools to emotionally manipulate others. The character is a cold fish to
those she interacts with, and they do not respond readily to her. The Cold of the Grave does not protect the
character against the depredations of the Beast. She
may be emotionally cold on the surface, but if others
taunt and anger her sufficiently, she is still subject to
frenzy as normal.

••• Curse of Life
The Curse of Life inflicts some of the undesirable
traits of the living upon the undead, removing their

corpselike nature and creating a false life to remind
them of the worst things about being alive. Targets of
this power regain only the unpleasant aspects of life, as
culled from the memory of the Discipline’s user. This
may include mundane hunger and thirst, sweat and
other excretions, the need to urinate and defecate, a
decrease in sensory acuity, and a particular vulnerability to attacks that the character might normally shrug
off.
System: The player spends one Willpower and rolls
Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 8) to affect a target
within line of sight and no farther than 20 yards or meters from the character. If the roll succeeds, the target
suffers the weaknesses of the living without gaining any
benefit from that state. He does not become immune
to sunlight or holy artifacts, for instance. However, he
does become badly distracted by mundane needs, with
the net result that his player suffers a +2 difficulty penalty to all rolls. He can ignore these distractions at the
cost of one Willpower point per scene. Additionally,
the victim cannot use blood to raise his Physical Attributes while this power is in effect, and Willpower
cannot eliminate this penalty. The power remains in
effect until the next sunset.

•••• Gift of the Corpse
This power, one of the most potent on the Corpse
in the Monster path, enables a necromancer to ignore
most of her race’s inherent weaknesses for a short time.
A dead body is not particularly vulnerable to sunlight,
holy artifacts, frenzy, or being staked through the heart,
after all, and so it is with a vampire using the Gift of
the Corpse. As with the Cold of the Grave, above,
the character using this power takes on an even more
deathlike mien. It lasts for less than a minute, typically, but that time may be enough to enable a character
to charge through a burning building without fearing
frenzy or instant death.
System: The player spends one Willpower and rolls
Stamina + Occult (difficulty 8). For every success, the
character can spend one turn in a state in which he is
more akin to an animated corpse than a vampire. Holy
artifacts and sanctified ground have no effect, and the
character is immune to frenzy and Rötschreck. Sunlight does only bashing damage, and then only if bare
skin is exposed on a clear day. Being staked through
the heart is only as much of a danger as getting stabbed
through his dead spleen would be. Fire harms him only
as it would a mortal — causing lethal damage instead
of aggravated.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

169

Should the character end the power’s duration while
exposed to any of the aforementioned harmful things,
he immediately takes their full effect. If he is staked, he
become immobilized; if he is on or near fire, he begins
to take the damage a Cainite should take, and he must
immediately roll against Rötschreck.

••••• Gift of Life
With the Gift of Life, the character can experience
the best and most positive things about being alive. The
overwhelming hunger for blood temporarily abates, allowing the character to consume and enjoy food and
drink. She can also enjoy sex as she wishes, and the sun
does not burn her. The Gift of Life comes with a dark,
terrible cost, however. Its use is almost sure to result in
the death of a mortal, as the vampire must expend an
enormous quantity of vitae in order to initiate it. The
Discipline’s effects last until the midnight after the
character uses the power, so it is in her best interests to
use it just after midnight.
System: The player spends 12 blood points, burning
as much blood as possible each turn until she meets
that level. She then rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty
6) and needs only one success for the power to work.
A botch has catastrophic effects. The character might
be instantly killed or might inadvertently Embrace her
victim, for example. If it takes longer than one turn
to spend the necessary blood to enact this ability, it
does not take effect until all 12 points have been spent.
However, the blood must be spent continuously — the
vampire cannot burn five, run off and feed, then burn
seven more an hour later. On the other hand, she may
feed as she activates the power — in one turn she might
burn one blood point while drinking three. Since few
Kindred above the Seventh Generation can easily expend such an amount of blood, the most efficient way
to activate this power is to have a human nearby who
can be sacrificed to power the transformation.
After her transformation, the character gains many
traits of an ordinary human. She is largely immune to
the scorching effects of the sun (Fortitude difficulties
to soak damage from direct sunlight are halved, and
she takes no damage if she is sufficiently covered), and
she can experience and enjoy many of the fine things
about human life. She retains a few of her vampiric
benefits, however. Fortitude and Auspex abilities remain in place if she has either of those Disciplines, and
the Storyteller may allow her to retain other Disciplines
as well if he deems them dramatically appropriate. She
also retains a vampire’s benefits when it comes to handling bashing damage. However, she is still vulnerable

170

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

to holy artifacts, human faith, and being staked. Her
blood remains vitae, not human blood. Use of this ability — which creates a mockery of human life — may
interfere with a character’s Path advancement, at the
Storyteller’s discretion.
The vampire is no more vulnerable to fire than any
other mortal while in this half-alive state, but she still
suffers somewhat from the Beast. Frenzy and Rötschreck
difficulties are halved (round up). She can remain active during the day without Humanity or Path-based
dice pool caps, although she is certainly tired during
the day, since that is not her usual time of activity.
Her Beast exacts a dangerous retribution when her
day of “life” is done. Although its influence is greatly
suppressed during this power’s duration, the Beast has
its way with the vampire for the next six nights, as all
difficulties to resist frenzy increase by three. The wise
necromancer hides herself away somewhere during
that period, but, depending on morality and temperament, enforced isolation might drive her to frenzy on
its own.

The Grave’s Decay
This path is derived from the observation of the
working of time on all things mortal. Stone crumbles
and the corpse rots away to nothing, a process of endless fascination to the lost Cainites known as Cappadocians. Indeed, for the undying, the process of decay
is a fascinating disease that afflicts everyone and everything save them. Under this path, a practitioner of
Necromancy channels that force.

• Destroy the Husk
Cainites who kill their victims, rather than just feeding upon them, frequently find themselves in need of a
quick way to dispose of a corpse. While there are many
ways to make sure that a corpse is not found — feed it
to a pack of hounds or weigh it down and throw it in a
river — many of these methods do involve risk to the
vampire and are not guaranteed to succeed. Destroy
the Husk, by contrast, is foolproof. Use of this power
simply turns one human corpse to a pile of about 30
pounds (13 kilograms) of unremarkable dust, roughly
the size and shape of that body.
System: The player spends one blood point as the
vampire drips her vitae onto the corpse. The player
then rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6). One
success is all that is needed to render the corpse into
dust, although the process takes a number of turns
equal to five minus the successes.

•• Rigor Mortis
One of the first changes that comes over a dead body
is rigidity; the corpse becomes stiff as a board, frozen
in a single pose. The Cainite who wields Rigor Mortis
is able to push a living or undead body to that frozen
point using only his will and understanding of the forces of decay. She forces her target to become rigid and
unable to move without enormous effort of will, as his
very muscles betray him.
System: The player spends a point of Willpower and
rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 7). Each success freezes the target in place for one turn. A failure
simply indicates the loss of the Willpower point, while
a botch renders the target immune to powers in the
Grave’s Decay path for the next 24 hours. The target
must be visible and within about 25 yards or meters for
this ability to take effect. A frozen target is treated as
though he has been staked (see p. 280). With a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) and two successes, the target
can break out of the rigor on her turn. Failure causes
her a level of bashing damage and means another turn
wasted and frozen.

••• Wither
Reminiscent of some of the powers of Vicissitude,
Wither allows a vampire to cripple an opponent’s limb.
Whether the foe is living or undead, muscle shrivels
away, skin peels, and bone becomes brittle. The target is unable to exert any noteworthy strength in the
crippled limb. This injury lasts for far longer than most
injuries trouble vampires, and in mortals it simply does
not heal.
Wither doesn’t have to be used on a limb, although
that is its usual purpose. It can also be used simply to
affect the target’s face and hair, making him appear far
older than his years. It could also be applied to a target’s eye or ear, killing the sense in that organ (and
thus requiring two uses to permanently blind or deafen). Wither cannot be used as an “instant-kill” power
— necromancers cannot wither internal organs — but
it can inflict a wide variety of injuries on a foe.
System: The player spends a Willpower point. The
character chooses a limb on the target and then touches that limb. If the target is trying to avoid contact, the
invoker’s player rolls Dexterity + Brawl to hit as normal. If the character succeeds in touching the intended
limb, the target suffers two aggravated wounds. Unless
the target soaks both wounds (such as with Fortitude),
the struck limb is crippled and unusable until both of
those wounds have healed. Kindred heal the wounds as

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

171

they would any other aggravated wound (see p. 285).
Mortals are incapable of healing aggravated wounds, so
they suffer throughout their lives unless they are healed
through supernatural means. A withered limb does not
degenerate further, even on a mortal. The character
may be crippled for life, but the limb won’t become
infected or gangrenous.
The effects of the withering depend on the affected
limb. A crippled arm has a Strength of 0, cannot benefit from Potence, and cannot carry anything heavier
than about half a pound (200 grams). A crippled leg
prevents the character from moving faster than a stuttering hop or dragging limp. The character suffers the
effects of the Lame Flaw (see p. 482). A single withered
eye or ear imposes a +1 difficulty to relevant Perception
rolls. Losing both eyes or both ears imposes the effects
of the Blind or Deaf Flaws (see pp. 484 and 483). A
withered tongue imposes the effects of the Mute Flaw
(p. 483), while a withered face reduces the target’s Appearance by one for each aggravated wound suffered.

•••• Corrupt the Undead Flesh
Corrupt the Undead Flesh blurs the line between life
and undeath, turning an undead creature into something just living enough to carry and suffer from disease. The disease inflicts the target, causing lethargy,
dizziness, loss of strength, clumsiness, and the inability to keep blood in his system. This pernicious influence is extremely virulent among mortals. They pick
the disease up simply by spending a few hours near the
victim. Other vampires have a harder time acquiring
the disease. They must consume the victim’s blood to
do so, but afterward, they suffer just as much as the
original target — including passing the affliction on
to others.
The disease fades after roughly a week.

• The victim’s player must spend one additional
blood point every evening for the vampire to rouse
himself to consciousness. Mortals lose one health level
per day instead.
• The victim’s player must roll Self-Control or Instinct each time the character feeds (difficulty 8). On
a failure, the vampire cannot keep the blood he just
ingested inside his body, and he vomits it up in great
horrifying gouts of gore, losing any benefit the blood
might have provided. Humans vomit up food.
Every evening at sunset, the victim has a chance to
throw off the plague. The victim’s player rolls Stamina,
with a difficulty equal to 10 minus the number of sunsets since acquiring the plague. On a successful roll, the
character fights the disease to a standstill and begins
to recover. He instantly regains his ability to manage
blood, and he heals back one lost Attribute point per
hour until all have returned.

••••• Dissolve the Flesh
This ability brings the Grave’s Decay path full circle,
as it causes Destroy the Husk to apply to vampires. Dissolve the Flesh allows a necromancer to attempt to
turn vampiric flesh to dust or ash, as though the target
had been burned or left out in the sun.
System: The player spends two blood points and a
Willpower point as the vampire extracts a quantity of
her vitae charged with the power of the grave. If she
drips it onto a single Kindred victim anytime within
the next few turns (most of the blood must reach the
victim, so flinging a few drops is ineffective), it causes
whole chunks of the victim’s body to crumble to ash.
The player rolls Willpower against a difficulty of the
victim’s Stamina + 3. For every success, the target
takes one aggravated wound.

System: The player chooses a target within her
character’s line of sight and no more than 20 yards or
meters away. She rolls Intelligence + Medicine (difficulty 6) and spends a point of Willpower. The victim’s
player must roll Stamina (+ Fortitude, if appropriate)
against a difficulty equal to the attacker’s Willpower. If
the player scores more successes than the victim, he acquires a virulent disease immediately. The disease has
the following effects:

The undead flesh damaged by this power turns to
dust (gone for the time being), and it must be regenerated painstakingly by the victim, should he survive.
That dust doubtlessly has mystical properties that various sorcerers might be able to take advantage of. Every
wound inflicted by this ability represents the loss of
about one-eighth of the target’s weight; the Storyteller
chooses where the loss comes from. (It might also be
shed from all over, leaving the victim a bit gaunter or
missing chunks of flesh.)

• The victim’s Strength and Wits are halved (round
down).

Regenerating body parts occurs naturally while healing aggravated wounds at the normal rate (see p. 285).

• The victim loses one point of Dexterity.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Path of the Four Humors
Philosophically, the four humors represent different
qualities, split along two axes: hot and cold, and wet
and dry. Blood is hot and wet; phlegm is cold and wet;
yellow bile is hot and dry; and black bile is cold and dry.
Historically, when a mortal was out of sorts or ill, it was
said that his humors were out of balance, and a philosopher or physician would try to heal him by bringing his
humors back into balance. Ancient necromancers believed that in their undead forms, all four humors were
held in a mystical stasis, and that they could tap into all
four of them instead of merely tapping into blood in the
form of vitae as other vampires did.
This antiquated path was primarily considered the
knowledge of the Lamia bloodline, and certainly very
few necromancers have learned this path without tutoring from a Lamia. Since the loss of the Lamia, elder
necromancers have searched everywhere (both in this
world and the next) for clues to its existence.

• Whispers to the Soul
The necromancer with this ability can let slip a little
of her own undead bilious humor as she speaks to another being (whether mortal or Kindred). The wicked
vapor slips into the target’s ear and whispers nightmares to the target throughout the day and night. The
target has a harder time sleeping, and becomes irritable
and distracted during his waking hours.
System: The character must whisper the target’s
name (as she knows it) into his ear. The victim rolls
Willpower (difficulty 8). If the roll fails, the victim suffers from nightmares and hears mad, wicked mutterings while awake, for a number of full days equal to the
necromancer’s Manipulation. The victim loses one die
from all dice pools while thus afflicted, and at the Storyteller’s discretion, the difficulty to resist Rötschreck
may be increased by one at the same time.

•• Kiss of the Dark Mother
Kiss of the Dark Mother allows the necromancer
who uses it to mix her vitae with black bile, turning it
into a noxious poison. The necromancer forces it into
her mouth as saliva might once have come; the vitae
tastes acrid and bitter, as though it had been scorched.
Once the necromancer coats her teeth and lips with it,
she can inflict terrible damage with her bite.
System: The player spends one blood point; activating this power is a reflexive action, but it must be done
before making a bite attack. If the bite hits, the aggravated damage inflicted by a single bite is doubled be-

fore soak is calculated. This power does not affect the
character’s ability to drain blood from the target, nor
does it increase the amount of damage done by blood
loss. The necromancer’s bite remains potent until this
ability is discharged by a successful hit or she spends
one turn cleansing the dark blood from her mouth.

••• Dark Humors
The vampire can exude a coat of a particular humor
onto her skin, causing all that touch it to experience
the most intense form of that humor. After a necromancer has used this power, she generally feels the
opposite of the sensation the humor usually conveys:
Using blood leaves her depressed and pessimistic; using
yellow bile renders her calm and placid; using black
bile leaves her optimistic; and using phlegm makes her
aroused and angry.
System: The player spends two blood points. The
necromancer chooses which humor she wishes to excrete. The humor can simply coat the skin — in which
case touching the victim’s skin lets the humor take effect — or it can act as a poison if placed in a beverage (or in vitae). The victim must make a Stamina roll
(difficulty 8) to resist the effects of the humor:
• Phlegm: Target becomes lethargic; all dice pools
are reduced by two for the remainder of the scene.
• Blood (vitae): Target becomes prone to excessive
bleeding, and any lethal or aggravated wounds he suffers deal an additional health level of damage on the
turn after they originally occur. Vitae altered by Dark
Humors will not turn a human into a ghoul if ingested,
nor will it initiate a blood bond.
• Black Bile: Target suffers a number of health levels
of damage equal to the necromancer’s Stamina. This
damage is considered lethal and can be soaked (if the
victim is normally capable of soaking such damage),
though armor does not protect against it.
• Yellow Bile: Target becomes melancholic and is
plagued with visions of death. He cannot spend Willpower for the remainder of the scene, and all Willpower rolls receive a +2 difficulty.

•••• Clutching the Shroud
Blood, the sanguine humor, was regarded by philosophers as being both hot and wet. Blood from a cold
corpse has been transubstantiated into a dead form —
a cold incarnation of a hot, wet element. This transformation of the living into death holds great power;
the necromancer knows how to infuse her own being
with the blood of a cold corpse and transform herself

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

173

into something not wholly vampiric. Instead, the necromancer edges closer to being an animated corpse in
fact as well as name. She grows distant and chill, as
though possessed by the spirit of Death itself; she has to
work to push her attention into the physical world.
System: The character must drink, and then spend,
five blood points from a cold corpse (one dead for 24
hours or more, but generally less than three days). It
will generally take at least two turns to consume that
blood, and the power is not activated until the character can spend all of it. For example, if the character
is Twelfth Generation, Clutching the Shroud takes at
least seven turns total to activate (two to consume the
blood and five to spend it).
After the power is active and for the rest of the scene,
the necromancer gains several benefits. First, she receives two additional soak dice, which may be used to
soak any sort of damage, even if the character does not
possess Fortitude. Second, she gains a mystic sense of
how far those in the area are from death — whether
they are healthy or infirm, suffer from diseases, or are
undead, ghouls, or mortals. Finally, a Manipulation +
Occult roll lets her speak with ghosts freely. The difficulty for this roll depends on how attuned to death a
locale is; a cemetery would be difficulty 5, while a cozy
apartment might be difficulty 7. However, this ability
makes the necromancer much more susceptible to the
effects of powers used by ghosts, which means that she
must act carefully.

••••• Black Breath
A necromancer who has mastered this path can harness the undead black bile that festers at the core of her
being; she pulls that melancholy to her lungs and lets it
mingle with her outgoing breath. She then exhales the
dark mist, letting it engulf those nearby. The necromancer feels curiously lightheaded and optimistic after
using this power, as she has forced some of her most
depressed nature out into the world; those caught in
the black vapors grow despairing and hopeless.
System: The player spends one Willpower and one
blood point, and rolls Stamina + Athletics (difficulty
7). Black Breath allows the character to exhale a dark
cloud of vapor that is five yards or meters in diameter per
success rolled. Those caught in the mists may attempt
a Dexterity + Athletics roll to escape it if they have an
available action; otherwise, they may be overwhelmed
by depression to the point of suicide. Those who cannot escape the mists must immediately roll Willpower

174

(difficulty 8 for mortals, 7 for supernatural beings) and
achieve more successes than the invoker did. Mortals
who fail in this actively attempt to kill themselves on
their next turn. They do not attempt such ludicrous
suicides as praying for a lightning bolt or holding their
breath; they use the most effective means at hand to
end their own lives. If prevented from suicide, they attempt it again as soon as an opportunity presents itself.
This impulse lasts for the rest of the scene, and the Storyteller may impose flare-ups over the next day or so at
his discretion. Those who succeed on the Willpower
roll still become enchanted with the prospect of death,
whether mortal or Kindred, and lose two dice from all
dice pools for the rest of the scene.
Kindred who fail the Willpower roll do not attempt
suicide; as they are already dead, the malign influences
of undead humors do not have as strong an effect on
them. Instead, the affected vampire sinks into torpor.
The duration of this torpor is based on the vampire’s
Humanity or Path rating, just as if lethal wounds had
forced him into it.

Vitreous Path
The Vitreous Path allows a necromancer to control
and influence the energies pertaining to death. This
extremely rare path manipulates entropy, a force that
even most necromancers are uncomfortable harnessing. A development of the Nagaraja bloodline (p. 406,
although they sometimes call the path “Nihilistics”),
the Vitreous Path makes a formidable complement to
the necromantic craft, and those obsessed with mastery over death and souls — such as the Harbingers of
Skulls — would certainly risk much to uncover this
path’s secrets.
Like most necromancers, Nagaraja generally learn
the Sepulchre Path before any others. The Vitreous
Path is usually their second focus of study.

• Eyes of the Dead
The necromancer employing the Eyes of the Dead
can see with the perceptions of the Restless Dead
(called Deathsight). To such a manipulator of ghostly
energies, the auras of surrounding beings give off telltale hints as to their health and even their ultimate
fate; the necromancer can see the energies of death
flowing through everyone, just as ghosts can. By looking at the entropic markings on a person’s body, the
necromancer can gain rough knowledge of how far that
person is from death, how soon that person is likely to
die, and even what the cause of her death is likely to

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

be. The information thus gained is not exact by any
means, but it gives the necromancer an edge over those
she scrutinizes.
System: The player rolls Perception + Occult, difficulty 6. One success lets a necromancer determine
whether someone is injured, diseased, or dying, as well
as whether the individual labors under any sort of curse
or baleful magic.
Further, the vampire can divine the target’s eventual
demise, depending on the successes scored. One success means the character can guess how long the target has to live to within a few weeks. Three successes
means the character can estimate how long the target
has to live and what the probable source of death will
be, as the entropic markings show the wounds that will
someday exist on that person. Five successes means the
character can actually see where and when the event
will occur by interpreting the black marks on the target’s soul.
This ability lasts for one scene, though the necromancer may choose to end the power early. It can be
used to read the fate of only one target at a time. Storytellers should exercise judgment with this power, since
the markings of death are typically unavoidable. He
may decide to roll the dice himself, so that the player
has no way of knowing whether her insight is correct.

•• Aura of Decay
The necromancer can strengthen the feeling of entropy around her to the point where it breaks down
nonliving objects and machines. It can gnarl wood,
rust metal, crack silicon chips, and erode plastic, glass,
and dead organic material. This power has a range of
one yard or meter from the necromancer’s body, but all
those in the presence of the vampire can feel her corruption as an icy wind.
System: No roll is required, but this power does cost
at least one blood point. Objects subjected to this Aura
of Decay break down and become useless after being
targeted. How the object gives out, as well as the exact
mechanism of failure, is up to the Storyteller. Corrosion, metal fatigue, or sheer brittleness are all suitably
likely for any given item’s demise, but the in-game effect of using a doomed item is as if the owning character rolled a botch. The speed at which an item breaks
down depends on how many blood points are spent.
Blood Spent Time to Breakdown

One day

End of scene

Note that since this power requires the expenditure
of blood points, a character cannot cause an Aura of
Decay while staked.

••• Soul Feast
Just as the necromancer can release entropic energies from within, she may also pull them into herself
as a source of power. Soul Feasting allows the caster
to either draw on the ambient death energies around
her or to actively feed on a ghost, stealing the wraith’s
substance and mystically transforming that energy into
sustenance.
System: The player spends one Willpower point to
allow the vampire to feed on the negative energies of
the dead. If the character is drawing the energies from
the atmosphere, she must be in a place where death has
occurred within the hour or in a place where death is
common, such as a cemetery, a morgue, or the scene of
a recent murder. Generally, the necromancer can draw
anywhere from one to four points of entropy from such
a location, although the difficulty in using all Necromancy and similar deathly powers within the area
increases by an equal amount for a number of nights
equal to the points taken. The energies of such an area
may only be drained once until the area’s entropy replenishes.
In cases when the necromancer feeds on a ghost, the
vampire must actually attack the wraith as if feeding
normally. Wraiths have up to 10 “blood points” that
may be taken from them, and they become less and
less substantial as their spirit essence drains away. The
character is vulnerable to any attack the ghost might
make, even those that do not normally affect the physical world; while feeding, the vampire is essentially in
a half-state, existing in both the living lands and the
Underworld simultaneously. The wraith so attacked is
considered immobilized and cannot run or escape unless it can defeat the vampire in a resisted Willpower
roll (difficulty 6 for both sides). This power may also
be used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy,
allowing the vampire to drain power (though not sustenance) from ghosts while traveling in the lands of
the dead.
This soul energy may be used just like blood in every respect except for when the vampire rises for the

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

175

night. It can activate Disciplines, heal wounds, boost
Attributes, etc. Botching this power renders the vampire unable to feed through the Shroud for the rest of
the night. However, she remains susceptible to the assaults of ghosts and spirits for several turns (generally,
a number of turns equal to the amount of energy that
could have been drawn from the area, or one turn if attacking a ghost) as she hovers between worlds, unable
to function effectively in either.

•••• Breath of Thanatos
The Breath of Thanatos allows the necromancer to
draw out entropic energy and focus it upon an area
or person by taking a deep breath and then forcefully
exhaling a fog of necromantic energy. This cloud of
virulence is completely invisible to anyone without the
ability to see the passing of entropy. The energy of this
cloud is like a beacon for Spectres, and they are drawn
to the entropic force like moths to a flame.
Once the energy is pulled from the necromancer’s
body, she can either disperse it over a large area as a
lure for Spectres, or use the mist for more sinister purposes. Channeled into an object or person, the deathmist inflicts the subject with a debilitating, wasting illness. Furthermore, the focused energies are tainted and
eerie, and though generally invisible (except to powers
such as Aura Perception), they tend to cause people
and animals to feel uncomfortable around the victim.
System: The player spends one blood point and rolls
Willpower (difficulty 8). Only one success is needed to
draw out the Breath of Thanatos. If dispersed to summon Spectres, the energies cover roughly one-quarter
of a mile (400 meters) in radius, centered around the
necromancer. The range increases by an additional
one-quarter mile or 400 meters for every additional
blood point expended.
Spectres summoned with this power will ignore the
summoning necromancer for the duration of the power unless provoked, but may well go out of their way
to wreak havoc on anyone else in the vicinity. The
necromancer can then use other Necromancy powers
(such as those in the Sepulchre Path) to manipulate
and affect these Spectres. Ghosts so targeted may then
interact with the necromancer as normal, although the
other Spectres in the area will continue to ignore both
the vampire and the targeted ghost. This energy disperses after a scene, after which the Spectres leave to
find new prey. Mechanics for Spectres can be found on
p. 385.

176

If the cloud is directed toward a particular target, the
necromancer must either touch the target or direct the
stream of entropy using Dexterity + Occult (difficulty
7). A target laden with entropy suffers one (and only
one) level of aggravated damage; this generally manifests as sudden illness or decay. The target’s social difficulties while interacting with those unfamiliar with
the touch of death — most normal humans, as well as
some supernatural creatures — increase by 2. Furthermore, supernatural perceptions indicate the target is
tainted with decay, which can be dangerous. This form
of taint lasts until sunrise; a victim already plagued by
this power cannot be affected again until the previous
fog of entropy has dispersed.
A botch on the roll to control this power indicates
that the vampire has turned the energy upon himself,
and suffers all the effects of the vitriolic breath. This
inflicts the usual injury and may subject the necromancer to the possibly dangerous attention of provoked
Spectres and other creatures from beyond the grave.

••••• Night Cry
The breath of entropic energy becomes a scream of
pure chaos. The necromancer can issue an unearthly cry
(heard both in the living world and in the Shadowlands).
The howl pours icy oblivion into a target or group of
targets — either sweeping away the inherent entropy or
collecting that destruction and unleashing it.
System: The vampire chooses a number of targets
within one yard or meter per dot of Necromancy and
invokes Night Cry with a terrible scream. The player
spends a Willpower point and a blood point for each
target beyond the first. (In other words, she spends
no blood if only going after one target, or one blood
for two targets. Generational blood limits apply, and
the vampire may not “pre-spend” blood prior to using
Night Cry.)
The player then chooses whether the vampire will aid
or harm the targets, and rolls Manipulation + Occult
(difficulty 6). If she chooses to aid the target or targets,
each success gives each affected target a -2 difficulty
modifier to all of his actions for one turn per success. If
she instead chooses harm, each success causes an aggravated wound to each target. Targets may be any kind of
living creature, including supernatural ones.
No matter the result, the Night Cry is heard on both
sides of the Shroud, attracting the attention of anyone
nearby. On a botch, the necromancy may summon unruly ghosts or Spectres, similar to Breath of Thanatos

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

(although the ghosts are under no compulsion to ignore the necromancer…).

Necromantic Rituals
The rituals connected with Necromancy are a hodgepodge lot. Some have direct relations to the paths, while
others seem to have been taught by ghosts themselves,
for whatever twisted reason. All beginning necromancers gain one Level One ritual automatically, but any
others learned must be gained through in-game play.
Necromantic rituals are otherwise identical to Thaumaturgy rituals (pp. 230-240) and are learned in similar
fashion, though the two are not at all compatible.
System: Casting times for necromantic rituals vary
widely; see the description for particulars. The player
rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 3 + the level of
the ritual, maximum 9). Success indicates the ritual
proceeds smoothly, failure produces no effect, and a
botch indicates something has gone horribly wrong.

Level One Rituals
Call of the Hungry Dead
Call of the Hungry Dead takes only 10 minutes to
cast and requires a hair from the target’s head. The ritual climaxes with the burning of that hair in the flame
of a black candle, after which the victim becomes
able to hear snatches of conversation from across the
Shroud. If the target is not prepared, the voices come
as a confusing welter of howls and unearthly demands;
he is unable to make out anything intelligible, and may
go briefly mad.

Eldritch Beacon
Eldritch Beacon takes 15 minutes to cast. The material component is a green candle, the melted wax from
which must be collected and molded into a half-inch
(1.5 cm) sphere. Whoever carries this sphere, whether
in his hand or in a pocket, is highlighted in the Shadowlands with a sickly-glowing green-white aura. All
ghostly powers affect this individual with greater ease
and severity. The sphere retains its power for one hour
per success on the casting roll.

Insight
This ritual allows a necromancer to stare into the
eyes of a corpse and see reflected there the last thing
the dead man witnessed. The vision appears only in
the eyes of the cadaver and is visible to no one except the necromancer using Insight. The player rolls

as normal as the vampire stares into the target’s eyes
for five minutes. The number of successes on the roll
determines the clarity of the vision. A botch shows the
necromancer his own Final Death, which can provoke
a Rötschreck roll (see p. 299).
This power cannot be used on the corpses of vampires
who have reached Golconda, or on bodies in which
both eyes are missing or advanced decomposition has
already occurred.

Knowing Stone
By use of her own blood and the proper rituals, a
necromancer can mark a person’s spirit, allowing the
vampire to see where her subject is at any time, even
after he has died. In this fashion many of the spirithaunted vampires keep tabs on their close kin and
their enemies.
The necromancer cuts her skin or otherwise bleeds
herself, and then uses the vitae to paint the name of
the target on a consecrated stone. If the ritual is successful, she can afterward learn the target’s current
whereabouts by dancing around the stone in a trance
state until one of the spirits whispers the desired information into her ear. The stone loses its powers on the
night of All Saints Day unless the vampire spends a
blood point.

Minestra di Morte
The necromancer obtains a piece of a dead body and
simmers it in a pot with half a quart (or half a liter)
of vampiric vitae. To this stew, the necromancer adds
rosemary (for remembrance), basil (the funerary herb),
and salt (the alchemic principle of clarification). After
bringing the concoction to a full boil, the necromancer
eats it.
If the roll to activate this ritual is successful, the
character discovers whether the subject of the grisly

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

177

rite became a wraith or Spectre after death, or if indeed
she became either. Unfortunately, this information can
be learned only about the person from whose body the
“stew meat” was taken.
The blood component is spent progressively through
the ritual: If the Necromancer takes the blood from
another Kindred, she doesn’t become partially bound
from drinking it, nor does she add a point to her blood
pool. Similarly, if she uses her own blood, her pool decreases by a point but does not increase when she consumes the soup.
Necromantic vampires without the Eat Food Merit
(see p. 480) can’t keep the soup down, but can still use
the ritual and gain the information.

Ritual of the Smoking Mirror
This ritual allows the necromancer to use an obsidian
mirror to see as ghosts do. By gazing into the mirror’s
ebony depths, the vampire may discover an object’s
flaws, assess the general health of mortals, or even read
a being’s aura.
At the start of the ritual, the Kindred decides which
of the ritual’s two aspects she will use — she may not

178

use both at the same time. With Lifesight, the necromancer may read auras as if she had the level two
Auspex power Aura Perception. Deathsight, on the
other hand, grants the necromancer the ability to see
ghosts and the Shadowlands. It also shows the stain of
oblivion on the living, as per Eyes of the Dead (p. 174).
At the Storyteller’s discretion, the Kindred may make
a similar study of an inanimate object’s flaws and how
to repair them, if that object has a strong link to either
life- or death-energies (such as a murderer’s knife or a
window box used to grow healing herbs).
To perform the ritual, the necromancer grasps an obsidian mirror that has had its edge sharpened so that it
cuts the flesh of whoever takes hold of it. As the vitae
flows onto the mirror’s surface, it allows the mirror’s reflective power to bridge the worlds of the living and the
dead, much as it allows the necromancer herself to do.
The player then rolls to activate the ritual as normal.
If successful, the Necromancer may view the world as
a ghost does via the reflective surface of the mirror, for
one scene. On a botch, the vampire may well invoke
the ire of the spirits upon whom she calls.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Level Two Rituals
Eyes of the Grave
This ritual, which takes two hours to cast, causes the
target to experience intermittent visions of her death
over the period of a week. The visions come without
warning and can last up to a minute. The caster of the
ritual has no idea what the visions contain, as only the
victim sees them. Each time a vision manifests, the target must roll Courage (difficulty 7) or be reduced to
quivering panic. The visions, which come randomly,
can also interfere with activities such as driving, studying, shooting, and so on.
Eyes of the Grave requires a pinch of soil from a fresh
grave.

The Hand of Glory
The Hand of Glory is a mummified hand used by the
necromancer to anesthetize a home’s residents and,
thereby, allow him free rein to do what he will in the
residence. To create one, the necromancer wraps the
severed hand of a condemned murderer in a shroud,
draws it tight to squeeze out any remaining blood, and
preserves the hand in an earthenware jar with salt, saltpeter, and long peppers. After a fortnight, the vampire
removes the hand and dries it in an oven with vervain
and fern. At the end of this process, if the roll to activate the ritual garners any successes, the creation is
viable.
To use the Hand of Glory, the vampire first coats
the fingertips of the mummified hand with a flammable
substance derived from the fat of a hanged man and
sets the fingers alight. The necromancer then recites
the phrase, “Let all those who are asleep be asleep, and
let those who are awake be awake.” All mortals within
a household who are affected fall into a deep sleep and
cannot be roused (the hand has no effect on supernatural creatures). For each unaffected occupant of a home,
one finger of the hand will refuse to light. Botches may
result in all of the fingers being lit but no one in the
home being asleep. The hand may be extinguished at
any time by the necromancer who created it. Anyone
else wishing to douse the hand must use milk to do so
— nothing else works. Once made, the Hand of Glory
may be reused indefinitely. Effects last for one scene.

Occhio d’Uomo Morto
To cast this ritual, the necromancer needs an eye
from a corpse whose absent soul became a ghost or

Spectre. The eye is ritually prepared in a process involving incense, the new moon, and a period of midnight chanting. The chanting climaxes when the necromancer removes one of her own eyes and replaces it
with the one from the corpse (fresher is better). Kindred healing takes over at that point, sealing the eye
within the socket.
If the ritual succeeds, the Necromancer permanently
gains the Shroudsight ability (see p. 163). This ability
is always active and does not require a roll.
Furthermore, if it was a Spectre’s corpse, the vampire
can hear the vague murmuring of any Spectres in the
area. This ability isn’t very precise; rather than mind
reading, it’s more like trying to overhear a low-voiced
conversation in the next room. With a Perception +
Occult roll, the Necromancer can glean a very vague
impression of what nearby Spectres are up to. Botching
this roll may well earn the necromancer a new derangement (at the Storyteller’s discretion), as the whispers
creep into the caster’s subconscious.
This ritual has some major drawbacks, the first being
that its proper result is hideously ugly. Unless the vampire wears sunglasses or finds some other way to conceal her eye, her Appearance is reduced by one dot.
Also, dead or rotted tissue is not the best for normal
perception. Any mundane visual Perception rolls are at
+1 difficulty (possibly more if the corpse had bad eyesight in life). On the other hand, since the eye offers
a window into a different soul than the necromancer,
it offers some protection against powers requiring eye
contact. These Disciplines are used against the deadeyed necromancer at +1 difficulty.
Most importantly, however, the ghost whose body
was desecrated knows it, and very likely hates it. The
ghost can find the necromancer possessing his eye anywhere, and all ghostly powers used against the necromancer by that particular ghost are at –1 difficulty.

Puppet
Used primarily to facilitate conversations with the
recently departed, though also applied as a method of
psychological torture, Puppet prepares a subject (willing or unwilling) as a suitable receptacle for ghostly
possession. Over the course of one hour, the necromancer smears grave soil across the subject’s eyes, lips, and
forehead. For the remainder of the night, any wraith
attempting to take control of the subject gains two automatic successes. The ritual’s effects remain even if
the soil is washed off.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

179

The Ritual of Pochtli
This ritual cannot be cast by itself, but only in conjunction with another Necromantic ritual, or with the
heavily ritualized use of a Necromantic path. The action of the ritual is this: Two or more Kindred necromancers restrain a mortal vessel and inflict incisions in
the shape of blasphemous symbols (typically subverted
Egyptian hieroglyphs or Aztec symbols). They then
drink from these injuries. Each participating Necromancer must make his own cut and drink from no other cut. Thereafter, the Necromantic power the Kindred
seek to employ gains the benefit of all the participants’
knowledge. This ritual makes it possible for Necromancers to create truly fearsome feats of death magic.
The player rolls to activate this ritual as normal. If
the roll succeeds, the Kindred who have participated
in the ritual may work together on the path or ritual
the Ritual of Pochtli is intended to assist, and players
share successes. Note that the primary application of
Necromancy requires its own roll, and that successes
(and failures) garnered by the group are pooled. All
Kindred participating in the ritual must know the Ritual of Pochtli as well as the ritual or path power the
group seeks to enact.
The downside of this power is that a single player’s
botch negates the successes of the entire group, resulting in a horrific failure for all the ritual workers.

Two Centimes
The necromancer ceremonially “kills” a mortal, laying him out on a pallet and putting pennies on his eyes.
The mortal’s soul journeys to the Underworld, which
he perceives, initially at least, as a way-station. The
mortal can interact with the souls of the dead and travel elsewhere in the Underworld, while also retaining
the power to speak to the vampire and describe what
he’s experiencing. While in the Underworld, however,
the subject’s soul cannot affect the environment. Although he may talk to other spirits, he may not physically interact with them or their surroundings — he is
a “ghost among ghosts,” as it were. Minions may voluntarily undergo the ritual to assist necromancers, or
the vampire may use Two Centimes to terrify unwilling victims.

Level Three Rituals
Blood Dance
The Blood Dance allows a ghost to communicate
with a living relative. Necromancers sometimes per-

180

form this ritual for people in exchange for money or
favors.
The vampire must dance and chant for two hours,
calling forth the right spirit and entreating all other
ghosts to leave the area. While dancing, the vampire
pours colored sands and ocean salt on the ground in a
precise pattern and then makes the link between the
living person and the deceased. If successful, the ghost
“appears” within the necromancer’s sand-sigil and the
living person can communicate with her for one hour.
Failure means the spirit could not be contacted.

Divine Sign
Upon learning a person’s birth date, the necromancer’s player may roll to activate this ritual. If successful,
the Kindred may use this to predict the target’s next
course of action, allowing him to deal with it accordingly. The effect on ghosts is quite different: Instead,
the ritual imparts upon the necromancer so intimate
an understanding of the wraith in question that it acts
as a connection to the ghost, making it easier to invoke
other Necromancy effects on that spirit. For story purposes, it’s the equivalent to holding one of that wraith’s
fetters (see Ritual of the Unearthed Fetter, below).

Din of the Damned
This ritual is similar to the Level One Ritual Call
of the Hungry Dead (see p. 177) in that it makes the
sounds of the Underworld audible in the physical realm.
However, Din of the Damned is an area-effecting ritual used to ward a room against eavesdropping. Over
the course of half an hour, the necromancer draws an
unbroken line of ash from a crematorium along the
room’s walls (this line may pass over doorframes to allow entrance and egress). For the rest of the night, any
attempt to listen in on events inside the room, whether
simple (such as a glass to the wall), electronic (like a
laser microphone), or mystic (including powers such as
Heightened Senses), requires the eavesdropper to score
more successes in a Perception + Occult roll (difficulty
7) than the caster of the ritual scored. Failure to beat
this mark gives the listener an earful of ghostly wailing
and moaning and the sound of howling winds; a botch
deafens him for the rest of the night.

Nightmare Drums
The necromancer using this ritual sends the dead to
haunt the dreams of an enemy, using the ghosts to drive
an opponent slowly insane. Once the ritual is cast, the
vampire has no control over this power, except to stop
it from continuing. The shape of the nightmares and

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

the images that assault the target are not under the
control of the necromancer; they are under the control
of the ghosts who actually do the haunting.
The necromancer uses his own blood and a personal
possession of the target’s in this ritual. Once the item
has been coated with blood, the vampire must burn the
item, sending a ghostly icon of it to the Shadowlands
both as an identifying badge and as a reward to the
ghosts who agree to haunt the target. While the item
burns, the necromancer (and assistants, if available)
pound out a relentless beat on gigantic drums of human skin. The drums are inaudible in this realm but
thunderous in the home of the dead. To silence the
deafening drums, the ghosts resignedly agree to negotiate with the necromancer. They promise to send nightmares to the victim for as long as the vampire demands,
in return for a favor. Their request normally runs along
the lines of passing a message to a living relative or exacting revenge against someone who slighted them.

Ritual of The Unearthed Fetter
This ritual requires that a necromancer have a finger bone from the skeleton of the particular ghost he’s
interested in. When the ritual is cast, the finger bone
becomes attuned to something vitally important to the
wraith, the possession of which by the necromancer
makes the casting of Necromantic powers against that
ghost much easier (see the Sepulchre Path, p. 160, for
an example). Most necromancers take the attuned finger bone and suspend it from a thread, allowing it to
act as a sort of supernatural compass and following it to
the special item in question.
Ritual of the Unearthed Fetter takes three hours to
cast properly. It requires both the name of the ghost
targeted and the finger bone already mentioned, as
well as a chip knocked off a gravestone or other marker
(not necessarily the marker of the bone’s former owner). During the course of the ritual the stone crumbles
to dust, which is then sprinkled over the finger bone.

roll against difficulty 7 (if done outside of combat, the
difficulty is only 6). During the next combat turn, she
bites through her own lips (taking a level of bashing
damage) and spits (spending one blood point). Then
the normal ritual roll is made to see whether the power
takes effect.

Level Four Rituals
Baleful Doll
A baleful doll is a powerful figure that is linked directly to the spirit of the target. This doll must be handcrafted, and is only finished when it has been painted
with the blood of the necromancer and dressed in some
article of clothing from the victim (which should be
unwashed for a better connection). Once the doll has
been cursed, the vampire can use it to cause physical
damage to the target. If the doll is injured (often with
pins or other items), the victim takes six dice of bashing damage. If the doll is destroyed, the target suffers
six dice of lethal damage.
The necromancer must craft the doll, using ritual
chants throughout the process. This normally takes
four to five hours. The player rolls Stamina + Crafts
(difficulty 8) to succeed in this part of the ritual — a
doll that does not resemble its victim is useless for the
purposes of this ritual, though some necromancers sell
failures as “authentic voodoo dolls” to tourists.

Bastone Diabolico
Casting this ritual is tricky because it requires the
removal of a leg bone from a living person. The donor
must survive the removal, at least for a little while. The
bone is then submerged in molten lead. Once it cools,
the thin lead coating is inscribed with various runes.
The necromancer then uses this metal-shod bone
to beat its donor to death while repeating a droning
Greek chant.

Unlike most rituals, Tempesta Scudo can be cast
speedily. The necromancer performs a short and awkward dance that ends with her biting through her own
lip and spitting the blood in a circle around her. All
ghosts’ actions within the circle of blood are made at
+2 difficulty.

With a successful roll, this ritual produces a bastone
diabolico or “devil stick.” The stick can be activated by
anyone who holds it and expends a point of Willpower.
Activation lasts for a scene, and during that time any
ghost hit with the devil stick loses a point from its Passion pool (see p. 385). In addition to its normal effects,
this club does an additional die of damage when used
against the walking dead (not vampires), and such
damage is aggravated.

To cast this ritual successfully, the necromancer must
spend one combat turn performing the dance. At the
end of the turn, she makes a Dexterity + Performance

Unfortunately for the necromancer, ghosts can sense
that the bastone diabolico is bad news, even if they don’t
know exactly what the thing does. They tend to stay

Tempesta Scudo

away from anybody carrying one, which means that all
rolls for such a character to use powers that summon or
attract ghosts occur at +1 difficulty.

Cadaver’s Touch
By chanting for three hours and melting a wax doll in
the shape of the target, the necromancer turns a mortal
target into a corpselike ruin. As the doll loses the last
of its form, the target becomes cold and clammy. His
pulse becomes weak and thready, and his flesh pale and
chalky. For all intents and purposes, he becomes a reasonable facsimile of the walking dead. This can have
some adverse effects in social situations (+2 difficulty
on all Social rolls). The effects of the ritual wear off
only when the wax of the doll is permitted to solidify.
If the wax is allowed to boil off, the spell is broken.

Peek Past the Shroud
This hour-long ritual enchants a handful of ergot
fungi mold to act as a catalyst for second sight. By eating a pinch of the mold, a subject gains the benefits of
Shroudsight (p. 163) for a number of hours equal to the
necromancer’s Stamina score. Three doses of the enchanted ergot are created for every success on the roll.
Ergot is normally poisonous to some degree; this ritual
removes its toxic properties. However, a botch renders
the ergot highly and instantaneously toxic, inflicting
eight dice of lethal damage on any subject who ingests
it — including vampires.

Ritual of Xipe Totec
To perform the ritual, the Kindred removes his victim’s top layer of skin with an obsidian dagger, taking care to damage the skin as little as possible in the
process. The victim must survive this process (though
she may well die of blood loss shortly after the ritual
if not seen to properly). He then drains the victim’s
blood into a large ceremonial golden bowl. There the
blood is mixed with octli, amaranth flower, and other
ingredients. When imbibed by the necromancer, this
mixture causes him to sweat a glistening sheen of blood
(equal to one blood point). The Kindred then dons the
skin of his victim, which on a successful roll absorbs
the Kindred vitae and begins to heal, forming a second
skin over the vampire’s own. The victim needs to be of
similar stature — otherwise, the features become distorted and the disguise is rendered useless. This power
also has no effect on supernatural creatures (although
it can affect ghouls).
Under normal visual scrutiny, the ruse is flawless. Of
course, it imparts none of the victim’s knowledge or

182

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

mannerisms (and does nothing to mask the Kindred’s
own undead nature). Therefore, it works best for situations in which contact with friends and family may
be minimized. To preserve the skin’s condition, the
Kindred must bathe it in a blood point’s worth of vitae nightly. When the necromancer removes the skin
(which causes one level of unsoakable lethal damage
to the user and must be done with the same knife used
to flay the victim in the first place), it is ruined in the
process.

Level Five Rituals
Chill of Oblivion
Performed over the course of 12 hours (reduced by
one hour per success on the casting roll), this ritual
infuses the necromancer or a willing subject with the
chill of the grave. The ritual’s material component is a
one-foot (half-meter) cube of ice, which is slowly melted on the subject’s chest (inflicting three health levels
of bashing damage on mortal subjects). The subject
must lie naked on bare earth for the entire duration
of the ritual. Once the ritual is completed, its effects
remain for a number of nights equal to the caster’s Occult rating.
An individual affected by Chill of Oblivion treats
aggravated damage from fire and high temperatures as
if it were lethal damage. Furthermore, he may attempt
to extinguish any fire by rolling Willpower (difficulty
9); each success reduces the fire’s soak difficulty (see
p. 297) by 1, and a fire with a soak difficulty of 2 dwindles to glowing embers.
However, this ritual has several drawbacks. First
and foremost, the subject’s aura is laced with writhing
black veins that resemble those left by diablerie, and
may well be mistaken for such by any observer who is
not familiar with this ritual. The subject also radiates a
palpable aura of cold that extends to about arm’s length
from him; this can be extremely disconcerting to mortals, though it causes no damage, and its game effects
mirror those of the Flaws Touch of Frost (p. 494) and
Eerie Presence (p. 495). Finally, the mystical nimbus of
the ritual draws hostile ghosts to the subject, who may
plague him with unwholesome acts.

Dead Man’s Hand
The necromancer takes a rag stained in the blood,
sweat, or tears of the intended victim. She takes a
freshly severed human hand (which can come either
from a corpse or a living “donor”) and closes it around

the rag. As the hand decomposes, so does the victim.
His flesh bloats, turns gray and then green, then starts
to slough off. The victim’s brain remains fresh until the
very end, so he can see the maggots writhe in the putrescent rack of meat that once was his healthy body.
The necromancer makes the standard roll and spends
two blood points for each point of Stamina (and Fortitude) possessed by the victim. The victim loses health
levels according to the timetable below. Only the removal of the rag from the hand can stop the process.
If this happens, health levels return, also according to
the chart below.

Mortal characters who suffer more than 12 hours of
incapacitation die, while Kindred who remain Incapacitated for more than 12 hours succumb to torpor.

Esilio
Like Tempesta Scudo, Esilio is a quick and dirty ritual.
The necromancer simply speaks five syllables. No one
can identify the casting language, but according to the
ritual’s oblique history, the language is what God gave
humankind before the confusion of Babel. The legend
further states that while the particular meaning of the
words is lost, they are what Caine’s father said to him
while exiling him to Nod.
Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Words of
Exile are not spoken lightly. When the ritual is cast
successfully, it opens a hole within reality itself — a rip
between the lands of the living and the darkest depths
of the Underworld. This tear is invisible to normal vision, but to Witness of Death or Shroudsight it looks
like a black vortex opening within the vampire’s own
body (the very few unfortunate enough to look into the
gap with high levels of Auspex are generally unwilling or unable to discuss it). Any ghost clutched to the
Kindred’s chest is instantly torn to shreds. Grabbing a
ghost in this fashion requires a Clinch or Tackle maneuver. Destroyed spirits don’t come back for at least

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

183

a month, if ever. A wraith destroyed in this fashion
tends to return as a Spectre, if it returns at all.

so subtly that those nearby can’t actually recall the moment at which she left.

The necromancer may clutch and destroy a number
of spirits equal to the number of successes she rolled.
After that, the vortex closes. It closes at the end of the
scene if it hasn’t already.

Usually, few mortals or supernaturals (even those
trained in Awareness) can pierce through the fog of
Obfuscate. Animals, who rely more on their instincts
than their normal senses, can sometime perceive (and
be frightened by) the vampire’s presence. Children and
those to whom deception is foreign may also be able
to pierce the illusion, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
Finally, the Auspex Discipline enables Kindred to see
through Obfuscate. Even that is not guaranteed, however; refer to “Seeing the Unseen,” p. 142, for more
details. (Storytellers needing a die roll for animals or
children can use this quick and dirty guideline: treat
them as if they had Auspex 1 in terms of contesting
Obfuscate. They do not have the Auspex 1 power, but
are considered to have it when determining whether a
vampire is noticed.)

Of course, using one’s body as a portal between our
world and what some people might call Hell is neither
simple nor healthy. For starters, it costs a blood point
and a point of Willpower (which does not give an automatic success on the ritual roll). More importantly,
each success rolled inflicts a level of unsoakable lethal
damage on the necromancer. Most significantly, every
use of Esilio permanently reduces the necromancer’s
Humanity by one point if he follows that morality, and
may impact other Paths at the Storyteller’s discretion.

Grasp the Ghostly
Requiring a full six hours of chanting, this ritual allows a necromancer to bring an object from the Underworld into the real world. It’s not simple, however
— a wraith may object to having his possessions stolen
and fight back. Furthermore, the object taken must be
replaced by a material item of roughly equal mass, otherwise the target of the ritual snaps back to its previous,
ghostly existence.
Objects taken from the Underworld tend to fade away
after about a year. Only items recently destroyed in the
real world (called “relics” by ghosts) may be recaptured
in this manner. Artifacts created by wraiths themselves
were never meant to exist outside the Underworld, and
vanish on contact with the living world.

Obfuscate
Obfuscate is the uncanny ability for Kindred to conceal themselves from sight, sometimes even in full
view of a crowd. An Obfuscated vampire doesn’t actually become invisible, however — rather, he is able to
delude observers into believing that he has vanished.
Obfuscate also allows Kindred to change their features
and conceal other people or objects. Typically vampires using Obfuscate must be within a short range of
their witnesses (approximately five yards or meters per
dot of Wits + Stealth) for their power to be effective.
Unless the Kindred chooses to make herself seen,
she can remain obscured for as long as she wills it. At
higher levels, the vampire can actually fade from sight

184

Since Obfuscate clouds the mind of the viewer, vampires can’t use it to hide their presence from electronic
or mechanical devices. Video and photo cameras, for
example, capture the vampire’s image accurately. Even
so, the person using, say, her cell phone to record an
Obfuscated vampire will still have her mind impacted
by the power, and she won’t see the Kindred’s image until she views the video at a later date (if even
then).
Several Clans cultivate this power — the Assamites, Followers of Set, and Malkavians, for example
— but the Nosferatu are particularly known for this
Discipline. Some elder Kindred believe that Caine, or
perhaps Lilith, bestowed the Clan with this Discipline
to compensate for the hideous physical deformities its
members suffer.
Most Obfuscate powers last for a scene, or until the
vampire ceases maintaining them. Once evoked, they
require very little mental effort to keep in place.

• Cloak of Shadows
At this level, the vampire must rely on nearby shadows and cover to assist in hiding his presence. He steps
into an out-of-the-way, shadowed place and eases himself from normal sight. The vampire remains unnoticed
as long as he stays silent, still, under some degree of
cover (such as a curtain, bush, door frame, lamppost,
or alley), and out of direct lighting. The immortal’s
concealment vanishes if he moves, attacks, or falls under direct light. Furthermore, the vampire’s deception
cannot stand up to concentrated observation without
fading.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

System: No roll is required as long as the character
fulfills the criteria described above. So long as he remains quiet and motionless, virtually no one but another Kindred with a high enough Auspex rating will
see him.

•• Unseen Presence
With experience, the vampire can move around
without being seen. Shadows seem to shift to cover
him, and people automatically avert their gazes as he
passes by. Others move unconsciously to avoid contact
with the cloaked creature; those with weak wills may
even scurry away from the area in unacknowledged
fear. The vampire remains ignored indefinitely unless
someone deliberately seeks him out or he inadvertently
reveals himself.
Since the vampire fully retains his physical substance, he must be careful to avoid contact with anything that may disclose his presence (knocking over a
vase, bumping into someone). Even a whispered word
or the scuffing of a shoe against the floor can be enough
to disrupt the power.
System: No roll is necessary to use this power unless
the character speaks, attacks, or otherwise draws attention to himself. The Storyteller should call for a Wits +
Stealth roll under any circumstances that might cause
the character to reveal himself. The difficulty of the
roll depends on the situation; stepping on a squeaky
floorboard might be a 5, while walking through a pool
of water may require a 9. Other acts may require a certain number of successes; speaking quietly without giving away one’s position, for instance, demands at least
three successes. Upon success, the vampire, all her
clothing, and objects that could fit into a pocket are
concealed.
Some things are beyond the power of Unseen Presence to conceal. Although the character is cloaked
from view while he smashes through a window, yells
out, or throws someone across the room, the vampire
becomes visible to all in the aftermath. Bystanders snap
out of the subtle fugue in which Obfuscate put them.
Worse still, each viewer can make a Wits + Awareness
roll (difficulty 7); if successful, the mental haze clears
completely, so those individuals recall every move the
character made up until then as if he had been visible
the entire time.

••• Mask of a Thousand Faces
The vampire can influence the perception of others,
causing them to see a face different from his. Although

the Kindred’s physical form does not change, any observer who cannot sense the truth sees whomever the
vampire wishes her to see.
The vampire must have a firm idea of the visage he
wishes to project. The primary decision is whether to
create an imaginary face or to superimpose the features
of another person. Manufactured features are often
more difficult to compose in believable proportions,
but such a disguise is easier to maintain than having to
impersonate someone else. Of course, things get simpler if the Kindred borrows the face but doesn’t bother
with the personality.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Performance (difficulty 7) to determine how well the disguise
works. If the character tries to impersonate someone,
he must get a good look at the subject before putting
on the mask. The Storyteller may raise the difficulty if
the character catches only a glimpse. The chart below
lists the degrees of success in manufacturing another
appearance. Vampires wishing to mask themselves as
a person more attractive than they are must pay additional blood points equal to the difference between
the vampire’s Appearance rating and the Appearance
of the mask (which means that younger vampires may
need to take longer in order to spend the blood necessary).

some familiarity with the target in order to succeed.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

185

•••• Vanish from the Mind’s Eye
This potent expression of Obfuscate enables the
vampire to disappear from plain view. So profound is
this vanishing that the immortal can fade away even if
he stands directly in front of someone.
While the disappearance itself is quietly subtle, its
impact on those who see it is anything but. Most kine
panic and flee in the aftermath. Especially weak-willed
individuals wipe the memory of the Kindred from their
minds. Although vampires are not shaken so easily,
even Kindred may be momentarily surprised by a sudden vanishing.
System: The player rolls Charisma + Stealth; the
difficulty equals the target’s Wits + Alertness (use the
highest total in the group if the character disappears
in front of a crowd). With three or fewer successes,
the character fades but does not vanish, becoming an
indistinct, ghostlike figure. With more than three, he
disappears completely. If the player scores more successes than an observer’s Willpower rating, that person
forgets that the vampire was there in the first place.
Tracking the character accurately while he appears
ghostlike requires a Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 8). A successful roll means the individual can
interact normally with the vampire (although the
Kindred looks like a profoundly disturbing ghostly
shape). A failed roll results in a +2 difficulty modifier (maximum 10) when attempting to act upon, or
interact with, the vampire. The Storyteller may call
for new observation checks if the vampire moves to an
environment in which he’s difficult to see (heads into
shadows, crosses behind an obstacle, proceeds through
a crowd). When fully invisible, the vampire is handled
as described under Unseen Presence, above.

vokes the power gives himself away, the cloak falls
from everyone. This power is particularly useful if the
vampire needs to bring his retinue through a secure location without drawing the notice of others.
System: The character may conceal one extra individual for each dot of Stealth he possesses. He may bestow any single Obfuscate power at a given time to the
group. While the power applies to everyone under the
character’s cloak, his player need only make a single
roll. Each individual must follow the requirements described under the relevant Obfuscate power to remain
under its effect; any person who fails to do so loses the
cloak’s protection, but doesn’t expose the others. Only
if the vampire himself errs does the power drop for everyone.

••••• • Conceal
The vampire may mask an inanimate object up to
the size of a house (Obfuscate cannot be used to disguise inanimate objects without the use of this power).
If the object is hidden, so are all of its contents. While
Conceal is in effect, passersby walk around the concealed object as if it were still visible, but refuse to acknowledge that they are making any kind of detour.
System: In order to activate this power, a character
must be within about 30 feet (approximately 10 meters) of the object to be concealed and the item must
hold some personal significance for him. The Conceal
power functions as Unseen Presence for purposes of
detection, as well as the duration and durability of the
disguise.

A person subject to the vanishing makes a Wits +
Courage roll (mortals at difficulty 9, vampires at difficulty 5). A successful roll means the individual reacts
immediately (although after the vampire performs his
action for that turn); failure means the person stands
uncomprehending for two turns while her mind tries to
make sense of what she just experienced.

Conceal can be used on a vehicle in which the character is traveling. In this instance, traffic patterns seem
to flow around the vehicle, and accidents are actually
less likely as other drivers subconsciously maneuver
away from the concealed auto. A police radar gun still
registers a speeding car masked in this fashion, but the
officer behind the gun is disinclined to make a traffic
stop of the phantom blip. Using Conceal on aircraft
is problematic, as the power’s range generally doesn’t
extend far enough to cover air traffic controllers and
the like.

••••• Cloak the Gathering

••••• • Mind Blank

At this degree of power, the vampire may extend
his concealing abilities to cover an area. The immortal may use any Obfuscate power upon those nearby as
well as upon himself, if he wishes.
Any protected person who compromises the cloak
exposes himself to view. Further, if the one who in-

A vampire with this power is able to shrug off telepathic contact, easily withstanding invasive probes of
her mind.
System: Any attempt to read or probe the character’s
mind first requires a successful Perception + Empathy
roll (difficulty equal to the character’s Wits + Stealth).

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Even if a potential intruder does succeed, his dice pool
for the attempt is then limited to the number of successes he scored on the initial roll.

••••• • Soul Mask
In addition to concealing her form, a vampire who
has developed Soul Mask is able to conceal her aura.
She may display whatever combination of colors and
shades she wishes, or may appear to have no aura whatsoever. This power is of particular use to those of elder
Generation who have reached such heights of power
through diablerie.
System: The use of this power allows the projection of only one aura (or lack thereof) — the vampire
chooses the precise colors to be displayed when she first
develops Soul Mask. If the character has no experience
with the use of Aura Perception, she may not choose
an alternate aura, as she has no idea what one would
look like, though she can still choose to display no aura
whatsoever. Soul Mask can be bought multiple times,
if desired, in order to give a vampire multiple alternate
auras from which to choose.
Unless the player states otherwise, Soul Mask is always in effect. If the character has bought Soul Mask
two or more times, her “default” aura displayed is the
first one she learned.

••••• •• Cache
Most Obfuscate powers require the individual using
them to be within a short distance of the subjects of
the concealment. Cache extends this range considerably, allowing an elder with this power to leave people
or objects safely hidden while he goes about his business elsewhere.
System: A character must be within the normal required distance to initiate an Obfuscate power. Once
this is done, the player spends a Willpower point, which
activates Cache on top of the already functioning use
of the Discipline. The concealment will now remain
in effect as long as the vampire is within a distance
equal to his Wits + Stealth in miles (or one and half
times that in kilometers) from the object or person he
wishes to conceal. The enhanced concealment fades at
the next sunrise, or breaks (as always) if the Obfuscate
subject reveals himself.

••••• •• Veil of Blissful Ignorance
This power’s development is attributed to the Malkavians, but many Nosferatu have also found it to be
highly useful. The Veil of Blissful Ignorance allows a

vampire to Obfuscate an unwilling victim, removing
him from the notice of others. Some Nosferatu use this
power to teach a humbling lesson to individuals who
take the presence and aid of others for granted, while
others utilize it to remove an essential member of a
group in the midst of a crisis.
System: The character must touch the victim to activate this power. The player spends a blood point and
rolls Wits + Stealth (difficulty equals the victim’s Appearance + 3). If the roll is a success, the victim is subject to the effects of Vanish From the Mind’s Eye for a
length of time determined by the number of successes
the player rolls.

The victim of Veil of Blissful Ignorance does not necessarily know that he is under the effect of this power.
He is only aware that everyone around him has suddenly begun acting as if he were not there. The victim
cannot break this effect, even with violence; if he attacks someone, the target ascribes the act to the visible
individual nearest to him. More than one fatal brawl
has been incited by this side-effect. The Veil persists
even if the vampire who activated it leaves the area.
Curiously enough, Veil of Blissful Ignorance can
never be used on anyone who is ready and willing to
accept its effects.

••••• ••• Old Friend
Many elder Nosferatu have made reputations for omniscience with the secrets they learn through creative
uses of this power. A variation of Mask of a Thousand
Faces, Old Friend allows a vampire to probe a subject’s
subconscious and take the semblance of the individual
whom that victim trusts over anyone else. Someone
using this power does not appear as someone who the
victim is frightened of or awed by, but rather someone
to whom the victim feels comfortable revealing intimate secrets. Old Friend doesn’t necessarily make its
user appear as someone who is still among the living; a
long- dead friend or relative is just as likely, and in such
cases the subject remembers the encounter as a dream
or a ghostly visitation.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

187

System: The player rolls Manipulation + Subterfuge
(difficulty equal to the victim’s Perception + Alertness or Awareness, maximum 10). The more successes,
the more convincing the impersonation. This power
only affects one victim at a time; other observers see
the vampire as she truly is, unless she also establishes
a Mask of a Thousand Faces in addition to using Old
Friend.

••••• •••• Create Name
Some Toreador call this power the ultimate development of method acting. Create Name allows a character to create a completely new identity; face, speech
pattern, aura, even thought processes are constructed
according to the vampire’s desired identity. The power
can be used to impersonate an existing individual, or
it can project the semblance of a completely fictional
identity with perfect accuracy.
System: A vampire working with Create Name must
spend three hours a night in relatively uninterrupted
quiet to establish a new personality by means of this
power. The player makes an extended roll of Intelligence + Subterfuge (difficulty 8), one roll per night. A
total of 20 successes are necessary to construct a new
identity, while a botch removes five successes from the
vampire’s total. Once a new identity has been successfully created, however, the character can step into it at
any time without any sort of roll. Any outside observer
without Auspex 9 or the equivalent sees the artificial
identity. The character’s face, aura, Nature, Demeanor,
even thoughts and Psychological Merits and Flaws all
appear to be those of the persona selected and crafted
by the character.
The only way to pierce this disguise, other than Auspex 9, is to notice any discrepancies between the assumed identity and the Abilities it logically ought to
possess. A character with no dots in Medicine should
have a hard time pulling off a created identity as a neurosurgeon, for example. The Storyteller should make a
secret roll of Perception + Alertness (difficulty 9) for
each character who should catch a slip made by the
impostor.

Obtenebration
The signature power of the Lasombra, Obtenebration grants the vampire power over darkness itself. The
nature of the darkness invoked by Obtenebration is
a matter of intense debate among Kindred. Some believe it to be merely shadows, while others feel that the

188

power gives control over the stuff of the vampire’s soul,
coaxing it tangibly outward.
Regardless, the effects of Obtenebration are terrifying, as waves of darkness roil out from the Cainite, enveloping those in their path like an infernal wave. As
Obtenebration is mostly known as a Sabbat Discipline,
any Camarilla vampire caught using the power had
better have a damned good explanation.
Note: Vampires using Obtenebration can see through
the darkness they control, though other vampires (even
those that also have Obtenebration) cannot. Dreadful
tales of rival Lasombra struggling to blind and smother
each other with the same wisps of darkness circulate
among young members of the Clan, though no elders
have come forth to substantiate these claims.

• Shadow Play
This power grants the vampire limited control over
shadows and other ambient darkness. Though the vampire cannot truly “create” darkness, she can overlap and
stretch existing shadows, creating patches of gloom.
This power also allows Kindred to separate shadows
from their casting bodies and even shape darkness into
the shadows of things that are not there.
Once a Kindred takes control of darkness or shadow,
it gains a mystical tangibility. By varying accounts cold
or hellishly hot and cloying, the darkness may be used
to aggravate or even smother victims. Certain callous
Lasombra claim to have choked mortals to death with
their own shadows.
System: This power requires no roll, but a blood
point must be spent to activate it. Shadow Play lasts for
one scene and requires no active concentration. Kindred cloaking themselves in shadow gain an extra die
in their Stealth dice pools and add one to the difficulties of ranged weapon attacks against them. Vampires
who use the darkness to make themselves more terrifying add one die to Intimidation dice pools. Opponents
plagued by flapping shadows and strangling darkness
subtract one die from all Stamina dice pools (including soak). Mortals, ghouls, and other air-breathers reduced to zero Stamina by strangling shadows begin to
asphyxiate; vampires lose all appropriate dice but are
otherwise unaffected. Only one target or subject may
be affected by this power at any given time, though
some modicum of concealment is offered to a relatively
motionless group.
The unnatural appearance of this power proves extremely disconcerting to mortals and animals (and, at
the Storyteller’s discretion, Kindred who have never

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

seen it before). Whenever this power is invoked within
a mortal’s vicinity, that individual must make a Courage roll (difficulty 8) or suffer a one-die penalty to all
dice pools for the remainder of the scene, due to fear of
the monstrous shadows.

••• Arms of the Abyss

•• Shroud of Night

System: The player spends a blood point and makes
a simple (never extended) Manipulation + Occult roll
(difficulty 7); each success enables the creation of a
single tentacle. Each tentacle is six feet (two meters)
long and possesses Strength and Dexterity ratings equal
to the invoking vampire’s Obtenebration Trait — Potence and Celerity dots are added to these Strength and
Dexterity ratings, respectively. If the vampire chooses,
she may spend a blood point either to increase a single
tentacle’s Strength or Dexterity by one or to extend its
length by another six feet or two meters. Each tentacle
has four health levels, is affected by fire and sunlight
as if it were a vampire, and soaks bashing and lethal
damage using the vampire’s Stamina + Fortitude. Aggravated damage may not be soaked.

The vampire can create a cloud of inky blackness.
The cloud completely obscures light and even sound
to some extent. Those who have been trapped within
it (and survived) describe the cloud as viscous and unnerving. This physical manifestation lends credence to
those Lasombra who claim that their darkness is something other than mere shadow.
The tenebrous cloud may even move, if the creating
Kindred wishes, though this requires complete concentration.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Occult
(difficulty 7). Success on the roll generates darkness
roughly 10 feet (three meters) in diameter, though
the amorphous cloud constantly shifts and undulates,
sometimes even extending shadowy tendrils. Each
additional success doubles the diameter of the cloud
(though the vampire may voluntarily reduce the area
she wishes to cover). The cloud may be invoked at
a distance of up to 50 yards/meters, though creating
darkness outside the vampire’s line of sight adds two
to the difficulty of the roll and requires a blood point’s
expenditure.
The tarry mass actually extinguishes light sources it
engulfs (with the exception of fire), and muffles sounds
until they are indistinguishable. Those within the
cloud lose all sense of sight and feel as though they’ve
been immersed in pitch. Sound also warps and distorts
within the cloud, making it nearly impossible to accomplish anything (+2 difficulty, as per Blind Fighting on p. 274). Even those possessed of Heightened
Senses, Eyes of the Beast, Tongue of the Asp, and similar powers suffer the penalty for blindness due to the
unnatural darkness. Additionally, being surrounded by
the Shroud of Night reduces Stamina-based dice pools
by two dice, as the murk smothers and agitates the victims. This effect is not cumulative with Shadow Play,
although targets asphyxiate as per Shadow Play if they
reach 0 Stamina; more than one unfortunate mortal
has “drowned” in darkness.
Mortals and animals surrounded by the Shroud
of Night must make Courage rolls per Shadow Play,
above, or panic and flee.

Refining his control over darkness, the Kindred can
create prehensile tentacles that emerge from patches of
dim lighting. These tentacles may grasp, restrain, and
constrict foes.

Tentacles may constrict foes, inflicting (Strength +1)
lethal damage per turn. Breaking the grasp of a tentacle requires the victim to win a resisted Strength roll
against the tentacle (difficulty 6 for each). However,
tentacles cannot be used for any kind of manipulation,
such as typing or driving.
All tentacles need not emanate from the same source
— so long as there are multiple patches of suitable
darkness, there are sources for the Arms of the Abyss.
Controlling the tentacles does not require complete
concentration; if the Kindred is not incapacitated or
in torpor, she may control tentacles while carrying out
other actions.

•••• Black Metamorphosis
The Cainite calls upon his inner darkness and infuses himself with it, becoming a monstrous hybrid of
matter and shadow. His body becomes mottled with
spots of tenebrous shade, and wispy tentacles extrude
from his torso and abdomen. Though still humanoid,
the vampire takes on an almost demonic appearance,
as the darkness within him bubbles to the surface.
System: The player spends two blood points and
makes a Manipulation + Courage roll (difficulty 7) —
vampires of lower Generation may have to take two
turns to make the transition. Failure indicates the vampire cannot undergo the Black Metamorphosis (though
he spends the blood points nonetheless). A botch inflicts two unsoakable health levels of lethal damage on
the vampire as darkness ravages his undead body.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

189

While under the effects of the Black Metamorphosis,
the vampire possesses four tentacles similar to those
evoked via Arms of the Abyss (though their Strength
and Dexterity ratings are equal to the vampire’s own
Attributes, including dice from Celerity and Potence).
These tentacles, combined with the bands of darkness
all over the Kindred’s body, subtract two dice from the
Stamina and soak dice pools of opponents physically
touched in combat, for as long as the vampire remains
in contact with the victim. This is not cumulative
with other powers in Obtenebration, although targets
can asphyxiate at Stamina 0, as per Shadow Play. The
vampire may make an additional attack without penalty by using the tentacles (for a total of two attacks,
not one additional attack per tentacle). Additionally,
the vampire can sense his surroundings fully even in
pitch darkness.
The vampire’s head and extremities sometimes appear to fade away into nothingness, while at other
times they seem swathed in otherworldly darkness.
This, combined with the wriggling tentacles writhing
from his body, creates an unsettling sight. Mortals, animals, and other creatures not accustomed to this sort
of display must make Courage rolls (difficulty 8) or suc-

190

cumb to a panic that amounts to Rötschreck (though
it is inspired by the darkness rather than fire). Many
Kindred cultivate this devilish aspect, and the Black
Metamorphosis adds three dice to the invoking Kindred’s Intimidation dice pools.

••••• Tenebrous Form
At this level, the Kindred’s mastery of darkness is so
extensive that she may physically become it. Upon activation of this power, the vampire becomes an inky,
amoeboid patch of shadow. Vampires in this form are
practically invulnerable and may slither through cracks
and crevices. In addition, the shadow-vampire gains
the ability to see in natural darkness.
System: The transformation costs three blood points
(which may need to occur over three turns, depending on the vampire’s Generation). The vampire is immune to physical attacks while in the tenebrous form
(though she still takes aggravated damage from fire and
sunlight), but may not herself physically attack. She
may, however, envelop and ooze over others, affecting them in the same manner as a Shroud of Night,
in addition to using mental Disciplines. Vampires in
Tenebrous Form may even slither up walls and across

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

ceilings or “drip” darkness upward — they have no
mass and are thus unaffected by gravity. Rötschreck
difficulties from fire and sunlight do increase by one for
vampires in this form, as the light is even more painful
to their shadowy bodies.
Mortals (and others not used to such displays) who
witness the vampire transform into unholy shadow require Courage rolls (difficulty 8) in order to avoid the debilitating terror described under Black Metamorphosis.

••••• • The Darkness Within
This power allows the Cainite to call forth the darkness contained in her black soul. This enormous, turbulent shadow vomits from the vampire’s mouth, though
some vampires are said to cut themselves and let the
blackness seep from their veins. The shadow-cloud engulfs a chosen target, burning it with a soul-scarring
chill and siphoning its blood away in torrents.
System: The player makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) and spends a blood point. The resulting shadow
envelops the target and, though it does not physically
harm the victim, it may strike terror into him. Individuals observing the Darkness Within, whether as targets or onlookers, may suffer from the terror described
under Black Metamorphosis, unless they are already
familiar with the Kindred’s power.
Individuals touched by The Darkness Within lose one
point of blood per turn, though targets may resist this effect by succeeding on a Stamina roll (difficulty 6) each
turn the target remains in contact with the cloud.
The Cainite invoking The Darkness Within must
devote all her attention to maintaining the cloud. If
the vampire is attacked, the darkness immediately returns to her through whatever orifice it originated. The
Cainite can summon the darkness back at any time,
gaining a number of blood points equal to one-half the
number the shadow siphoned from its victims (round
up). Taking blood from another in this fashion is similar to drinking from that vampire, and blood bonds
may result. Additionally, the Darkness Within may
take blood from only one individual per turn, though it
may be in contact with many.

••••• • Shadowstep
The vampire has such fine control over the darkness
that he may become it briefly and reform himself from
other darkness close by. The vampire may Shadowstep
through walls, floors, and even mystical barriers. The
Cainite simply steps “into” a shadow and re-emerges

from another shadow a short distance away (or next to
the barrier, if there is no shadow on the other side).
System: The player rolls Dexterity + Occult, and on
a successful roll, the character may emerge from another shadow no more than 50 feet (or 15 meters) away.
Failing the roll means simply that the character cannot
step through the shadow-realm, while a botch signifies the character has become trapped between shadows (which fiendish Storytellers should have a heyday
with). Pulling another individual through the shadow
requires a Strength + Occult roll, with consequences
for failure similar to failing by oneself.

••••• •• Shadow Twin
The vampire’s control over darkness has progressed
to such a degree that he may bestow upon it a limited degree of sentience. By animating his own shadow
or that of another, the Cainite can actually “free” the
shadow cast by light. While this power is active, the
subject casts no shadow, as it has left to pursue the
vampire’s commands.
This power can unnerve mortals and even a few inexperienced vampires. The Kindred wielding Obtenebration commands the individual’s shadow; some vampires
report having seen mortals literally scared to death, as
their shadows leapt away to taunt or menace them.
System: The player spends a blood point and makes
a Willpower roll (difficulty 8). If the roll succeeds, the
shadow springs to unholy freedom for one hour per
success (though it disappears at sunrise regardless of
how many successes the vampire had). The Shadow
Twin has Attribute and Ability ratings equal to half
those of its parent body; they won’t do much talking
or thinking, so Mental and Social Traits don’t matter
much, though Wits may come into play. Additionally,
the Shadow Twin has an Obtenebration score equal
to one-half of that of the vampire who animated it
(rounded down). Mortals and vampires unused to Obtenebration require a Courage roll upon witnessing
this, as per Shadow Play.
The twin may separate itself from the parent and
travel up to 50 feet or 15 meters away, crawling
through crevices or sliding up walls. It may attack and
be attacked, though it takes and does only half damage (again, round down). Flame and supernatural attacks (such as vampire fangs, mystical powers, etc.) do
full damage. If the Shadow Twin is killed, its parent
loses half her Willpower points and must roll to avoid
Rötschreck (difficulty 9).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

••••• ••• Oubliette
By creating a “chamber” of pure darkness, the Cainite may entrap or smother her enemies. No air exists
in this shadow-trap, and mortals suffocate within its
chilling void. Even vampires have little recourse once
trapped — they may leave only at their captor’s whim.
The Oubliette appears as a dense patch of shadow, unaffected by ambient light around it.
System: The vampire spends a blood point, but no
roll is necessary to create the Oubliette. To actually
create the Oubliette around someone requires a contested Wits + Larceny roll against the target’s Dexterity
+ Occult (difficulty 7 for both rolls). Mortals suffocate
within a number of minutes equal to their Stamina
(though the Lasombra may choose to leave their heads
exposed or trap a quantity of air inside as well), while
vampires are simply suspended impotently in darkness
and may not use Disciplines or take other actions. The
Oubliette vanishes instantly when touched by sunlight
— which has left more than one vampire exposed to the
sun’s unforgiving rays — or when the Kindred chooses
to relax it. A vampire may maintain only one Oubliette
at a time (which can only contain one target at a time),
which leads some Cainite philosophers to argue that it
is a prison created from the vampire’s very soul.

••••• •••• Ahriman’s Demesne
This power allows the vampire to summon a darkness so oppressive that it extinguishes the light of life
— or unlife — of any victim trapped within it. Ahriman’s Demesne creates a 50-foot (or 15-meter) radius
of void that issues from the Cainite’s hand and takes
away the bodies of those it claims when it vanishes.
The overwhelming darkness destroys friend and foe
alike, claiming anyone unfortunate enough to be within its circumference.
System: The player spends two points of Willpower
and concentrates for three turns. During this time, the
blackness billows out of the character’s hand, growing
to fill the area. At the end of the third turn, the player
rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 6). Everyone
in the darkness’ area suffers that many health levels of
damage (aggravated, if the victims are vampires) outright — six successes yield six levels of damage, not
six dice of damage. After Ahriman’s Demesne does its
damage, it collapses, taking with it the bodies of any
who died when they came in contact with the dreadful
shadow.

192

Potence
Kindred endowed with Potence possess unnatural strength. This Discipline enables vampire to leap
massive distances, lift tremendous weights, and strike
opponents with brutal force. Even low ranks of this
power can give Kindred physical power beyond mortal bounds. More powerful Kindred can leap so far that
they appear to be flying, toss cars like soda cans, and
punch through walls like cardboard. While the more
subtle mental Disciplines can be awe-inspiring, the
brutal effectiveness of Potence is formidable in its own
right.
The Brujah, Giovanni, Lasombra, and Nosferatu are
naturally gifted with this Discipline, but members of
other Clans often make a point to find someone who
can teach them the awesome power of Potence.
System: Each dot that the vampire has in Potence
adds one die to all Strength-related dice rolls. Further,
the player can spend one blood point and change his
Potence dice into an equal number of automatic successes to all Strength-related rolls for the turn. In melee and brawling combat, successes from Potence (either rolled or automatic) are applied to the damage roll
results.

Potence 6+
While flesh and blood have their limits, undead sinews and vitae have a bit more latitude when it comes
to feats of strength. Vampires who are close to Caine in
descent are sometimes capable of strength-based maneuvers that awe even other vampires. A product of
blood and will as much as of muscle and bone, mastery
of Potence gives a vampire the ability to do far more
than just lift progressively heavier objects — if the
vampire himself is willing to learn an alternate way.
Advanced Potence powers can be purchased in the
same fashion as advanced Celerity or Fortitude powers:
A character can choose to learn an alternate power instead of advancing along the Discipline’s normal progression, and can later go back and re-purchase what
he’s missed.

••••• • Imprint
A vampire with extensive knowledge of Potence can
squeeze very, very hard. As a matter of fact, she can
squeeze (or press, or push) so hard that she can leave
an imprint of her fingers or hand in any hard surface
up to and including solid steel. A use of Imprint can

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

simply serve as a threat, or it can be used, for example,
to dig handholds into sheer surfaces for purposes of
climbing.
System: Imprint requires a point of blood to activate.
The power remains active for the duration of a scene.
The depth of the imprint the vampire creates with Imprint is up to the Storyteller — decisions should take
into account how much force the vampire can bring to
bear, the toughness of the material, and its thickness.
If the object the vampire grasps is thin enough, at the
Storyteller’s discretion, the vampire might simply be
able to push through it (in the case of a wall) or tear it
off (in the case of a spear or pipe).

••••• •• Earthshock
According to some pundits, Potence is merely the
art of hitting something very hard. But what do you
do when your target is too far away to hit directly? The
answer is, if you’re sufficiently talented with the Discipline, to employ Earthshock. On its simplest level,
Earthshock is the ability to hit the ground at point A,
and subsequently have the force of the blow emerge
from the ground at point B.
System: The use of Earthshock requires the expenditure of two blood points, as well as a normal Dexterity
+ Brawl roll. The vampire punches or stamps on the
ground, and, if the attack is a success, the force of the
blow emerges from the ground as a geyser of stone and
earth directly underneath the target. The attack can be
dodged at a +2 difficulty.
Earthshock’s range is 10 feet or three meters for every level of Potence the vampire has, up to the limits
of visibility. A failure on the attack roll means that
the strike goes errant and is liable to explode anywhere
within range; a botch means that the vampire pulverizes the ground beneath him and may well bury himself
in the process.

••••• ••• Flick
It is a truism that “the great ones always make it look
easy.” In the case of Flick, that saying stops being a
truism and becomes literal truth. With this power, a
master of Potence can make the slightest gesture — a
wave, a snap of the fingers, the toss of a ball — and
have it unleash the full, devastating impact of a deadon strike. The attack can come without warning, limiting the target’s ability to dodge or anticipate; this makes
Flick one of the most feared applications of Potence.
System: Flick costs a point of blood, and requires
a Dexterity + Brawl roll (difficulty 6). The vampire

must also make some sort of gesture directing the blow.
What the gesture is remains up to the player — anything from a snap of the fingers to a blown kiss has
worked in the past.
Flick‘s range is equal to the limit of the Kindred’s
perception, and the blow struck does damage equal to
a normal punch (including all bonuses).

Presence
Presence is the Discipline of emotional manipulation. Vampires with this power can inspire passionate
fervor or unreasoning terror in mortals and Kindred
alike. In addition, unlike most Disciplines, some of
Presence’s powers can be used on entire crowds at one
time. Presence can transcend race, religion, gender,
class, and (most importantly) supernatural nature. As
such, this subtle power is one of the most useful Disciplines a vampire can possess.
Anyone can resist Presence for one scene by spending a Willpower point and succeeding on a Willpower
roll (difficulty 8), but the affected individual must keep
spending points until he is no longer in the presence
of the vampire (or, in the case of Summon, until the
effect wears off). Vampires three or more Generations
lower than the wielder need only spend a single Willpower to ignore the Presence for an entire night and
need not roll Willpower to do so.
The major drawback of Presence is that it controls
only the emotions. It causes others to feel a certain
way toward the vampire, but does not give her outright
control over them. While people weigh strongly the
orders that the vampire declares, their minds are still
their own. Suicidal or ridiculous directives don’t sound
any more sensible just because the person giving them
is unusually fascinating. Still, inspired eloquence or
significant wealth used in combination with this Discipline can enable the vampire to urge others along a
desired course.
The Brujah, Followers of Set, Toreador, and Ventrue
Clans are all adept in this Discipline. The Ventrue are
arguably the most skilled with its application, however,
due to their ability to use Presence and Dominate in
efficient combination.

• Awe
Those near the vampire suddenly desire to be closer
to her and become receptive to her point of view. Awe
is extremely useful for mass communication. It matters

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

193

little what is said — the hearts of those affected lean
toward the vampire’s opinion. The weak want to agree
with her; even if the strong-willed resist, they soon
find themselves outnumbered. Awe can turn a chancy
deliberation into a certain resolution in the vampire’s
favor almost before her opponents know that the tide
has turned.
Despite the intensity of this attraction, those so smitten do not lose their sense of self-preservation. Danger
breaks the spell of fascination, as does leaving the area.
Those subject to Awe will remember how they felt in
the vampire’s presence, however. This will influence
their reactions should they ever encounter her again.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Charisma + Performance (difficulty 7). The number of
successes rolled determines how many people are affected, as noted on the chart below. If there are more
people present than the character can influence, Awe
affects those with lower Willpower ratings first. The
power stays in effect for the remainder of the scene or
until the character chooses to drop it.

Those affected can use Willpower points to overcome

the vampire. As soon as an individual spends a number
of Willpower points equal to the successes rolled, he
shakes off the Awe completely and remains unaffected
for the rest of the night.

•• Dread Gaze
While all Kindred can frighten others by physically
revealing their true vampiric natures — baring claws
and fangs, glaring with malevolence, hissing loudly with
malice — this power focuses these elements to insanely
terrifying levels. Dread Gaze engenders unbearable terror in its victim, stupefying him into madness, immobility, or reckless flight. Even the most stalwart individual
will fall back from the vampire’s horrific visage.
System: The player rolls Charisma + Intimidation
(difficulty equal to the victim’s Wits + Courage). Suc-

194

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

cess indicates the victim is cowed, while failure means
the target is startled but not terrified by the sight. Three
or more successes means he runs away in abject fear;
victims who have nowhere to run claw at the walls,
hoping to dig a way out rather than face the vampire.
Moreover, each success subtracts one from the target’s
action dice pools next turn.
The character may attempt Dread Gaze once per turn
against a single target, though she may also perform it
as an extended action, adding her successes in order to
subjugate the target completely. Once the target loses
enough dice that he cannot perform any action, he’s so
shaken and terrified that he curls up on the ground and
weeps. Failure during the extended action means the
attempt falters. The character loses all her collected
successes and can start over next turn, while the victim
may act normally again.
A botch at any time indicates the target is not at all
impressed — perhaps even finding the vampire’s antics
comical — and remains immune to any further uses of
Presence by the character for the rest of the story.

••• Entrancement
This power bends others’ emotions, making them
the vampire’s willing servants. Due to what these individuals see as true and enduring devotion, they heed
the vampire’s every desire. Since this is done willingly,
instead of having their wills sapped, these servants retain their creativity and individuality.
While these obedient minions are more personable
and spirited than the mind-slaves created by Dominate, they’re also somewhat unpredictable. Further,
since Entrancement is of a temporary duration, dealing
with a lapsed servant can be troublesome. A wise Kindred either disposes of those she Entrances after they
serve their usefulness, or binds them more securely by a
blood bond (made much easier by the minion’s willingness to serve).
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Appearance + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’s
current Willpower points); the number of successes
determines how long the subject is Entranced, as per
the chart below. (Subjects can still spend Willpower to
temporarily resist, like any other Presence power.) The
Storyteller may wish to make the roll instead, since the
character is never certain of the strength of her hold
on the victim. The vampire may try to keep the subject
under her thrall, but can do so only after the initial
Entrancement wears off. Attempting this power while
Entrancement is already in operation has no effect.

•••• Summon
This impressive power enables the vampire to call to
herself any person whom she has ever met. This call
can go to anyone, mortal or supernatural, across any
distance within the physical world. The subject of the
Summons comes as fast as he is able, possibly without
even knowing why. He knows intuitively how to find
his Summoner — even if the vampire moves to a new
location, the subject redirects his own course as soon
as he can. After all, he’s coming to the vampire herself,
not to some predetermined site.
Although this power allows the vampire to call someone across a staggering distance, it is most useful when
used locally. Even if the desired person books the next
available flight, getting to Kyoto from Milwaukee can
still take far longer than the vampire needs. Obviously,
the individual’s financial resources are a factor; if he
doesn’t have the money to travel quickly, it will take
him a far greater time to get there.
The subject thinks mainly of reaching the vampire,
but does not neglect his own well-being. This is less
of a consideration if he only has to cross a room, unless he must get through a gang of gun-wielding punks
to do so. The individual retains his survival instincts,
and while he won’t shirk physical violence to reach
the vampire’s side, he won’t subject himself to suicidal
situations.
The Summoning dissipates at dawn. Unless the subject is trained to continue toward the vampire after the
first call, the immortal must Summon each night until
the target arrives. Still, as long as the vampire is willing and able, she is assured to greet her desired subject
some night — as long as nothing happens to him along
the way, of course.

Charisma + Subterfuge. The base difficulty is 5; this in-

creases to difficulty 7 if the subject was met only briefly.
If the character used Presence successfully on the target
in the past, this difficulty drops to 4, but if the attempt
was unsuccessful, the difficulty rises to 8.
The number of successes indicates the subject’s speed
and attitude in responding:

••••• Majesty
At this stage, the vampire can augment her supernatural mien a thousandfold. The attractive become
paralyzingly beautiful; the homely become hideously
twisted. Majesty inspires universal respect, devotion, fear — or all those emotions at once — in those
around the vampire. The weak scramble to obey her
every whim, and even the most dauntless find it almost
impossible to deny her.
People affected find the vampire so formidable that
they dare not risk her displeasure. Raising their voices
to her is difficult; raising a hand against her is unthinkable. Those few who shake off the vampire’s potent
mystique enough to oppose her are shouted down by
the many under her thrall, before the immortal need
even respond.
Under Majesty’s influence, hearts break, power trembles, and the bold shake. Wise Kindred use this power
with caution against mortal and immortal alike. While
Majesty can cow influential politicians and venerable Primogen, the vampire must be careful that doing so doesn’t
come back to haunt her. After all, a dignitary brought

196

low before others loses his usefulness quickly, while a humiliated Kindred has centuries to plan revenge.
System: No roll is required on the part of the vampire, but she must spend a Willpower point. A subject
must make a Courage roll (difficulty equal to the vampire’s Charisma + Intimidation, to a maximum of 10) if
he wishes to be rude or simply contrary to the vampire.
Success allows the individual to act normally for the
moment, although he feels the weight of the vampire’s
displeasure crushing down on him. A subject who fails
the roll aborts his intended action and even goes to
absurd lengths to humble himself before the vampire,
no matter who else is watching. The effects of Majesty
last for one scene.

••••• • Love
The blood bond is one of the most powerful tools in
an elder’s inventory. However, more and more childer
are aware of how to avoid being bound, so alternatives are needed. The Presence power called Love is
one such alternative, as it simulates the effects of the
bond without any of the messy side effects. While not
as sure a method of control as a true blood bond, nor
as long-lasting, Love is still an extremely potent means
of command.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Charisma + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’s
current Willpower points). Success on the roll indicates that the victim feels as attached to the character
as if he were blood bound to her. Each success also reduces the victim’s dice pool by one die for any Social
rolls to be made against the character. A botch makes
the target immune to all of the character’s Presence
powers for the rest of the night. This power lasts for
one scene and can be applied to the same victim over
multiple scenes in the same night.

••••• • Paralyzing Glance
Some elders have honed their mastery of Dread Gaze
to such a degree that they are said to be able to paralyze with a look. The power‘s name is something of a
misnomer, as victims of this power are not precisely
paralyzed in a physical sense, but rather frozen with
sheer terror.
System: The character must make eye contact
(p. 152) with her intended victim. The player then
rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal to
the target’s current Willpower points). Success renders
the victim so terrified that he falls into a whimpering,
catatonic state, unable to take any actions except curl-

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

ing into a fetal position and gibbering incoherently.
The condition lasts for a length of time determined by
the number of successes rolled. If the victim’s life is directly threatened (by assault, impending sunrise, etc.),
the poor wretch may attempt to break out of his paralysis with a Courage roll (difficulty equal to the character’s Intimidation + 3). One success ends the paralysis.
A botch sends the victim into a continuous state of
Rötschreck for the rest of the night.

••••• • Spark of Rage
A vampire possessing this power can shorten tempers and bring old grudges and irritations to the boiling
point with a minimum of effort. Spark of Rage causes
disagreements and fights, and can even send other
vampires into frenzy.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Manipulation + Subterfuge (difficulty 8). The number of individuals affected is determined by how many
successes are rolled. If this power is used in a crowd,
those affected are the people in closest proximity to
the character. A vampire affected by this power must
spend a Willpower point or roll Self-Control/Instinct
(difficulty equal to the character’s Manipulation +
Subterfuge); failure sends the target into a frenzy. A
botch by the vampire using Spark of Rage sends the
invoking character into immediate frenzy.

••••• •• Cooperation
Any elder knows that Kindred are the most difficult
beings in existence to force to work together. Peaceful
coexistence is not a common tenet of vampiric society.
With that in mind, this power can be used to nudge
those affected by it into a fragile spirit of camaraderie.
Some cynical (or realistic) Ventrue claim that their
Clan’s mastery of this Presence effect is the sole reason
that anything is ever accomplished in Camarilla conclaves. Ventrue who voice this opinion too loudly also
tend to have numerous chances to test just how effective Cooperation is.
System: To invoke Cooperation, the player spends a
blood point and rolls Charisma + Leadership (difficulty
8). The number of individuals affected is determined by
how many successes the player rolls. Cooperation lasts
for the remainder of the scene in which it is invoked,
though particularly strong users of Presence may create
longer-lasting feelings of non-aggression (at Storyteller
discretion) by spending Willpower. While this power
is in effect, all those under its influence are more favorably disposed toward one another and are more willing
to extend trust or make cooperative plans.
For the most part, players should simply roleplay Cooperation’s effects, but there are some concrete ramifications to the power‘s use. For example, Self-Control/
Instinct difficulties to resist frenzy in response to insults
from within the target group are decreased by three,
and certain Social Flaws may be decreased in impact
for the duration of Cooperation.

••••• ••• Ironclad Command
Any individual can normally resist the powers of
Presence for a brief time through an effort of will. Some
elder Toreador and Ventrue have developed such force
of personality that their powers of Presence cannot be
resisted without truly heroic efforts.
System: This power is always in effect once it has
been learned. A mortal may not spend Willpower to re-

198

sist the character’s Presence (for purposes of this power,
the definition of “mortal” does not include supernaturally active humans such as ghouls or those who possess
True Faith). A supernatural being must roll Willpower
(difficulty of the character’s Willpower + 2; difficulties
over 10 mean that the roll cannot even be attempted)
the first time he attempts to spend a Willpower point
to overcome the character’s Presence. For the rest of
the night, the maximum number of Willpower points
he can spend to resist the vampire’s Presence powers
is equal to the number of successes he rolled. A botch
doubles the character’s Presence dice pools against the
hapless victim for the remainder of the night.

••••• •••• Pulse of the City
A vampire who has developed her Presence to this
terrifying degree can control the emotional climate of
the entire region around her, up to the size of a large
city. This power is always in effect on a low level, attuning those who dwell in the area to the Kindred’s
mood, but it can also be used to project a specific emotion into the minds of every being in the area. Pulse
of the City affects residents much more strongly than
tourists, and also has a significant impact on those individuals who might be elsewhere at the time but who
still have strong ties to the affected city.
System: The character must be present in the city in
question, and have at least a casual, personal knowledge of its streets and makeup (maps won’t help). The
player spends a Willpower point and rolls Charisma +
Streetwise (difficulty 9, though specializations or Storyteller fiat may decrease this difficulty if the character
is intimately familiar with a particular city). The number of successes indicates how long mortal residents are
affected by the particular emotion that the character
broadcasts; visitors with no ties to the area and supernatural beings are affected for a duration one success
step lower. The character can choose to terminate this
effect at any time before it expires.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Protean
Protean allows the Kindred the mystical ability to
manipulate his physical form. Some vampires believe
the power stems from a heightened connection to the
natural world, while others consider it to be a magnification of the mark of Caine. Whatever its basis may
be, those that develop this Discipline can grow bestial
claws, take on the forms of bats and wolves, turn themselves into mist, and even meld into the very earth itself.
Transformed Kindred can generally use other Disciplines — vampires in wolf form can still read auras and
communicate with other animals, for example. However, the Storyteller may rule that certain Disciplines
may not be used in specific situations. The Kindred’s
clothes and personal possessions also change when he
transforms (presumably absorbed within his very substance), although armor and the like do not provide
any benefit while transformed.
Vampires cannot change or transform large objects or
other beings; Protean is a personal expression of power.
A Kindred who has been staked (thereby trapping his
soul within his body) cannot transform. Some vampires believe that those who have mastered the highest
levels of Protean can deny this limitation, however.
The Gangrel Clan is well known for their mastery of
Protean, although other Kindred have learned some of
this Discipline’s secrets from these bestial Cainites.

• Eyes of the Beast
The vampire sees perfectly well in pitch darkness,
not requiring a light source to notice details in even
the darkest basement or cave. The vampire’s Beast is
evident in his red glowing eyes, a sight sure to disturb
most mortals.
System: The character must declare his desire to call
forth the Eyes. No roll is necessary, but the change requires a full turn to complete. While manifesting the
Eyes, the character suffers a +1 difficulty to all Social
rolls with mortals unless he takes steps to shield his
eyes (sunglasses are the simplest solution). (A vampire
without this power who is immersed in total darkness
suffers blind-fighting penalties as per p. 274.)

•• Feral Claws
The vampire’s nails transform into long, bestial claws.
These talons are wickedly sharp, able to rend flesh with
ease and even carve stone and metal with little trouble.

The Beast is prominent in the claws as well, making
them fearsome weapons against other immortals. It’s
rumored that some Gangrel have modified this power
to change their vampiric fangs into vicious tusks.
System: The claws grow automatically in response to
the character’s desire, and can grow from both hands
and feet. The transformation requires the expenditure
of a blood point, takes a single turn to complete, and
lasts for a scene.
The character attacks normally in combat, but the
claws inflict Strength + 1 aggravated damage. Other
supernaturals cannot normally soak this damage, although a power such as Fortitude may be used. Additionally, the difficulties of all climbing rolls are reduced
by two.

••• Earth Meld
One of the most prized powers within Protean,
Earth Meld enables the vampire to become one with
the earth. The immortal literally sinks into the bare
ground, transmuting his substance to bond with the
earth.
Though a vampire can immerse himself fully into the
ground, he cannot move around within it. Further, it
is impossible to meld into earth through another substance. Wood slats, blacktop, even artificial turf blocks
Earth Meld’s effectiveness — then again, it’s a relatively simple matter for a vampire at this level of power
to grow claws and rip apart enough of the flooring to
expose the raw soil beneath.
By interring himself in the ground, the vampire gains
full protection from daylight when outdoors. It is also
the method of choice for those Kindred who wish to
sleep away the centuries; these vampires lock themselves in the earth’s embrace, gaining strength and
power as they rest. Superstitious and paranoid Kindred
whisper that thousands of Ancients sleep within the
ground and will awaken when Gehenna arrives.
While so interred, the vampire is in a transitional
state between flesh and earth. His physical presence
exists between the physical world and the astral plane.
As such, the vampire is difficult to sense, even through
supernatural means. However, a disruption to the soil
that the immortal occupies, or to his presence on the
astral realm, returns him immediately to the physical
world (and to full wakefulness), showering dirt outward as his body displaces the soil.
System: No roll is necessary, although the character must spend a blood point. Sinking into the earth is

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

199

automatic and takes a turn to complete. The character
falls into a state one step above torpor during this time,
sensing his surroundings only distantly. The player
must make a Humanity or Path roll (difficulty 6) for
the character to rouse himself in response to danger
prior to his desired time of emergence.
Since the character is in an in-between state, any attempts to locate him (catching his scent, scanning for
his aura, traveling astrally, and so on) are made at +2
difficulty. Astral individuals cannot affect the vampire
directly, instead meeting with a kind of spongy resistance as their hands pass through him. Similarly, digging in the material world encounters incredibly hardpacked earth, virtually as dense as stone.
Attempts at violence upon the submerged vampire
from either side return him to his physical nature, expelling the soil with which he bonded in a blinding
spray (all Perception-based rolls are at +2 difficulty for
the turn). The character himself subtracts two from
his initiative for the first turn after his restoration, due
to momentary disorientation. Once expelled from the
earth, the vampire may act normally.

•••• Shape of the Beast
This endows the vampire with the legendary ability
to transform into a wolf or bat. A Kindred changed
in this way is a particularly imposing representative
of the animal kingdom. Indeed, he is far superior to
normal animals, even ones possessed by Subsume the
Spirit. He retains his own psyche and temperament,
but can still call upon the abilities of the beast form
— increased senses for the wolf and flight for the bat.
Gangrel are reputed to change to other animal forms
better suited to their environment — jackals in Africa,
dholes in Asia, and even enormous rats in urban environments — a feat that other Clans learning Protean
cannot seem to duplicate.
System: The character spends one blood point to assume the desired shape. The transformation requires
three turns to complete (spending additional blood
points reduces the time of transformation by one turn
per point spent, to a minimum of one). The vampire
remains in his beast form until the next dawn, unless
he wishes to change back sooner.
While in the animal’s shape, the vampire can use any
Discipline he possesses except Necromancy, Serpentis, Thaumaturgy, or Vicissitude (as well as any others
the Storyteller deems unavailable). Furthermore, each
form gives the character the abilities of that creature.
In wolf form, the vampire’s teeth and claws inflict

200

Strength + 1 aggravated damage, he can run at double
speed, and the difficulties of all Perception rolls are reduced by two. In bat form, the vampire’s Strength is reduced to 1, but he can fly at speeds of up to 20 miles per
hour, difficulties for all hearing-based Perception rolls
are reduced by three, and attacks made against him are
at +2 difficulty due to his small size.
The Storyteller may allow Gangrel to assume a different animal shape, but should establish the natural
abilities it grants the character.

••••• Mist Form
This truly unsettling power enables the vampire to
turn into mist. His physical shape disperses into a hazy
cloud, but one still subject entirely to the immortal’s
will. He floats at a brisk pace and may slip under doors,
through screens, down pipes, and through other tiny
openings. Although strong winds can blow the vampire from his chosen course, even hurricane-force winds
cannot disperse his mist shape.
Some Kindred feel that this power is an expression of
the vampire’s ultimate control over the material world,
while others believe that it is the immortal’s soul made
manifest (damned though it may be).
System: No roll is required, although a blood point
must be spent. The transformation takes three turns to
complete, although the character may reduce this time
by one turn for each additional blood point spent (to
a minimum of one turn). Strong winds may buffet the
character, although Disciplines such as Potence may
be used to resist them. Vampires in Mist Form can perceive their surroundings normally, although they cannot use powers that require eye contact.
The vampire is immune to all mundane physical attacks while in mist form, although supernatural attacks
affect him normally. Also, the vampire takes one fewer
die of damage from fire and sunlight. The character may
not attack others physically while in this state — this
includes encountering another vampire in mist form.
He may use Disciplines that do not require physical
substance, however.

••••• • Earth Control
An Earth Melded character with this power is no
longer confined to the resting place she selected the
night before. She can pass through the ground as if it
were water, “swimming” through the earth itself. Some
elders use this as a means of unobstructed and unobtrusive travel, while others find it a highly effective means
of maneuvering in combat.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

System: This power is in effect whenever a character
is Earth Melded, with no additional roll or expenditure
necessary. While in the ground, a vampire can propel
herself at half of her normal walking speed. She cannot
see, but gains a supernatural awareness of her underground surroundings out to a range of 50 yards or meters. Water, rock, tree roots, and cement all effectively
block her progress; she can only move through earth
and substances of similar consistency, such as sand or
fine gravel. If two or more vampires attempt to interact underground, only direct physical contact is possible. All damage dice pools in this case are halved,
and dodge and parry attempts are at -2 difficulty. If
an underground chase takes place, it is resolved with
an extended, contested Strength + Athletics roll (see
p. 261).

••••• • Flesh of Marble
Tales have long spoken of the combat prowess of
Gangrel elders and of their inhuman resilience. Poorly
informed individuals believe the stories of swords shattering and bullets flattening against immortal skin
to be exaggerated reports of the effects of Fortitude.
Those with more reliable information know that such
tales result from encounters with vampires who have
developed Flesh of Marble. The skin of an elder with
Flesh of Marble becomes in essence a sort of flexible
stone, although it appears (and feels) no different than
normal skin and muscle.
System: The player spends three blood points to activate Flesh of Marble, which goes into effect instantly.
The effects of the power last for the remainder of the
scene. While the power is functioning, the damage dice
pools of all physical attacks made against the character
are halved (round down). That includes assaults made
with fists, claws, swords, firearms, and explosions, but
not fire, sunlight, or supernatural powers (unless the
effect in question is a direct physical attack, such as a
rock hurled by means of Movement of the Mind). Additionally, while this power is in effect, a character can
attempt to parry melee attacks with his bare hands as if
he were holding some form of weapon.

••••• •• Restore the Mortal Visage
Cainites are of two opinions regarding this power.
Those who are politically active, or who associate extensively with mortals, view it as both necessary and
acceptable. Those Kindred who embrace their more feral sides, however, see it as a disgusting defiance of the
very nature of vampirism. The schism comes because
the power allows the elder who possesses it to tempo-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

201

rarily return his appearance to what it was before the
Embrace, removing the bestial features he has accumulated over the centuries. Restore the Mortal Visage
has only been displayed by Gangrel; several Nosferatu
elders have attempted to develop it, and it is whispered
that they met spontaneous, grotesque Final Deaths
when they attempted to take their mortal forms.
System: The player spends three blood points and
a Willpower point and rolls Willpower (difficulty 8).
Success restores the character’s appearance to what it
was just before he was first Embraced, erasing all physical or social animalistic features gained from frenzies
(see p. 55). The power also affects any of the character‘s affected Traits relating to social interaction, returning them to their original values (for example, lost
Appearance dots return, but Humanity points removed
due to frenzy are not). A botched Willpower roll earns
the character another feature, as per the Gangrel Clan
weakness. Once activated, Restore the Mortal Visage
lasts for the remainder of the scene.

••••• •• Shape of the Beast’s Wrath
Users of this power are often mistaken for Tzimisce
employing the Vicissitude power Horrid Form. A vampire employing this power shifts into a huge, monstrous
form, gaining half her height again and tripling her
weight. Her overall shape flows into an unholy amalgamation of her own form and that of the animal she
feels the closest kinship to (wolves, rats, and great cats
are the most common manifestations, though ravens,
serpents, bats, and stranger beasts have been reported).
The vampire’s new shape does bear some vague resemblance to the war-forms of the werecreatures, but the
difference quickly becomes apparent.
System: The player spends three blood points, the
expenditure of which triggers the change. The character’s transformation takes three turns (the player may
spend additional blood points to reduce this time at a
cost of one point per turn of reduction). Once transformed, the character remains in this form until sunrise
or until she shifts back voluntarily.
The precise Traits of this form are determined when
the character first learns this power, as is the animal
whose appearance the character takes on. The vampire’s new form adds a total of seven dots to the character’s Physical Attributes. At least one dot must go
into each Physical Attribute, meaning that no more
than five can go into any one (so a character could
have +5 Strength, +1 Dexterity, and +1 Stamina, but
not +2 Strength and +5 Dexterity). These bonuses are

202

always the same once they are selected; a different allocation requires that the character buy this power a
second time and thus purchase another alternate form.
Additionally, the character inflicts Strength + 2 dice
of aggravated damage with both bite and claw attacks
when in monstrous form. She also gains an extra Hurt
health level, and doubles her normal running speed.
Finally, the character’s perceptions are also heightened. She is assumed to have both the Auspex power
Heightened Senses and the Protean power Eyes of the
Beast after transformation, with all of the benefits and
drawbacks of each.
This form does carry two additional drawbacks. The
first is a lack of communication ability. The character’s
Social Attributes all drop to 1, or to 0 if they already
were 1 (except when making Intimidation rolls) when
the transformation occurs. The second problem that
a character in this form encounters is the suddenly
heightened power of her Beast. All difficulties of rolls
to resist frenzy are increased by two for the duration of
the power’s effect, and the player may not spend Willpower points on such rolls.

••••• •• Spectral Body
This powerful variation on Mist Form allows a vampire to take a shape with most of the advantages of the
lesser power but fewer of the disadvantages. A vampire
who assumes Spectral Form retains his normal appearance, but becomes completely insubstantial. He walks
through walls and bullets with equal ease, and can pass
through the floor on which he stands if he chooses to.
Although his lungs are no longer solid, the vampire can
still speak, a fact in which some elders of the Daughters
of Cacophony bloodline have expressed great interest.
System: The player spends three blood points. The
transformation takes one turn to complete, and lasts
for the rest of the night unless the character decides to
reverse it. When the power takes hold, the character
becomes completely insubstantial, but remains fully
visible. Henceforth, he is unaffected by any physical
attacks, and he doubles his dice pool to soak damage
from fire and sunlight. The vampire may even ignore
gravity if he chooses to do so, rising and sinking through
solid objects if he does not wish to stand on them (although he may move no faster than his normal walking speed while “flying” in this manner). While in this
form, the character may also use any Disciplines that
do not require physical contact or a physical body. On
the downside, while in Spectral Form, a vampire can
physically manipulate his environment only through
the use of powers such as Movement of the Mind.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••••• ••• Purify the Impaled Beast
Camarilla records indicate that a disproportionately
small number of Gangrel elders were killed by mortals
and Anarchs during the Inquisition and the Anarch
Revolt. This power is one of the primary reasons for
the survival of these Kindred. An elder with this Protean power can expel foreign objects from her body
with great force, even excising stakes that transfix her
heart.
System: The player spends three blood points and
rolls Willpower (difficulty 6, or 8 if the vampire is paralyzed by an object impaling her heart). One success is
sufficient to remove all foreign objects and substances
from the character’s body. Dirt, bullets, and even stakes
through the heart are instantly and violently removed.
The larger the object, the farther away it is hurled by
this power. Objects expelled thus are considered to
have an attack dice pool of three for any bystanders,
and to have a dice pool of one to four (depending on
size) for damage. If the character wishes to leave an object in his body (such as a prosthetic limb) or partially
in (expelling a stake from his heart but leaving it sticking out of his breastbone as a ruse), the player must also
spend a Willpower point when activating this power.

••••• •••• Inward Focus
This power has no outwardly visible effects whatsoever. Indeed, its very existence is unknown outside
those Gangrel Methuselahs who have developed it.
The internal effects of this razor-sharp honing of Protean, however, are in some ways more dramatic than
any external manifestation. A vampire with this power
can heighten the efficiency of his undead body’s internal workings to levels undreamed of by lesser Kindred,
withstanding inconceivable amounts of injury and
moving with blinding speed and shattering strength.
System: The player spends four blood points to activate this power and an additional two blood points
for every turn past the first that Inward Focus is maintained. There are three effects of this power: First, the
character gains a number of extra actions during each
turn equal to his unmodified Dexterity score. Second,
the damage of his physical attacks is increased by three
dice per dice pool. Finally, all damage inflicted on the
character is halved and rounded down after the soak
roll is made (so an attack that inflicts five health levels
after soak is reduced to two health levels).
This power may be used in conjunction with other
Protean powers that modify the character‘s combat
abilities, such as Shape of the Beast’s Wrath (above).

It may also be used in conjunction with Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence, turning a vampire who has mastered this power into a truly terrifying opponent.

Quietus
The Discipline of silent death, Quietus is practiced
by those of Clan Assamite. Based on elements of
blood, poison, vitae control, and pestilence, Quietus
focuses on the destruction of a target through a variety
of means. This Discipline doesn’t always cause a quick
death, but the Assamites rely on its lethality to hide
their involvement with their victims.

• Silence of Death
Many Assamites claim never to have heard their
targets’ death screams. Silence of Death imbues the
vampire with a mystical silence that radiates from her
body, muting all noise within a certain vicinity. No
sound occurs inside this zone, though sounds originating outside the area of effect may be heard by anyone
in it. Rumors abound of certain skilled Assamite viziers
who have the ability to silence a location rather than a
circumference that follows them, but no proof of this
has been forthcoming.
System: This power (which costs one blood point to
activate) maintains a 20-foot (6-meter) radius of utter
stillness around the Kindred for one hour.

•• Scorpion’s Touch
By changing the properties of her blood, a vampire
may create powerful venom that strips her prey of his resilience. This power is greatly feared by other Kindred,
and all manner of hideous tales concerning methods of
delivery circulate among trembling coteries. Kindred
with Quietus are known to deliver the poison by coating their weapons with it, blighting their opponents
with a touch, or spitting it like a cobra. An apocryphal
account speaks of a proud Prince who discovered an
Assamite plotting her exsanguination and began to
diablerize her would-be assassin. Halfway through the
act, she learned that she had ingested a dire quantity of
tainted blood and was then unable to resist the weakened hashashiyyin’s renewed attack.
System: To convert a bit of her blood to poison, the
Kindred’s player spends at least one blood point and
rolls Willpower (difficulty 6). If this roll is successful,
and the vampire successfully hits (but not necessarily
damages) her opponent, the target loses a number of
Stamina points equal to the number of blood points

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

203

converted into poison — vampires attempting to drink
the blood of the Kindred with Scorpion’s Touch are
automatically considered to be “successfully hit.”
The victim may resist the poison with a Stamina +
Fortitude roll (difficulty 6); successes achieved on the
resistance roll subtract from the vampire’s successes.
The maximum number of blood points a Kindred may
convert at any one time is equal to her Stamina. The
number of successes scored indicates the duration of
the Stamina loss.

This terrible power allows a vampire to drown her
target in his own blood. By concentrating, the Kindred
bursts her target’s blood vessels and fills his lungs with
vitae that strangles him from within. The blood actually constricts the target’s body from the inside as it
floods through his system; thus, it works even on unbreathing Kindred. Until the target collapses in agony
or death throes, this power has no visible effect, and
many Kindred like it because it leaves no trace of their
presence.
System: The vampire must touch her target prior
to using Dagon’s Call. Within an hour thereafter, the
vampire may issue the call, though she need not be in
the presence or even in the line of sight of her target.

Permanently (though Stamina may
be bought back up with experience)

If a mortal’s Stamina falls to zero through use of Scorpion’s Touch, she becomes terminally ill and loses any
immunity to diseases, her body succumbing to sickness
within the year unless she somehow manages to increase her Stamina again. If a Kindred’s Stamina falls
to zero, the vampire enters torpor and remains that way
until one of her Stamina points returns. If a Kindred is
permanently reduced to zero Stamina, she may recover
from torpor only through mystical means.
To afflict someone with the poison, the Cainite must
touch her target’s flesh or hit him with something that
carries the venom. Many Assamites lubricate their
weapons with the excretion, while others pool the toxin in their hands (or fleck their lips with the poison,
for a “kiss of death”) and press it to their opponents.
Weapons so envenomed must be of the melee variety
— arrows, sling stones, bullets, thrown weapons, and
the like cannot carry enough of the stuff to do damage,
or it drips off in flight. Players whose vampires wish to
spit at their targets must make a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 6). No more than two blood points’
worth of poison may be expectorated, and a Kindred
may spit a distance of 10 feet (3 meters) for each point
of Strength (and Potence) the character possesses.
Vampires with Quietus are immune to their own poison, but not the blood-venom of other Kindred with
this power.

204

••• Dagon’s Call

Invoking the power costs one Willpower point.
The Kindred’s player makes a contested Stamina roll
against the target’s Stamina; the difficulty of each roll
is equal to the opponent’s permanent Willpower rating. The number of successes the vampire using Dagon’s Call achieves is the amount of lethal damage, in
health levels, the victim suffers. For an additional point
of Willpower spent in the next turn, the vampire may
continue using Dagon’s Call by engaging in another
contested Stamina roll. So long as the Kindred’s player
continues to spend Willpower, the character may continue rending her opponent from within.

•••• Baal’s Caress
The penultimate use of blood as a weapon (short of
diablerie itself), Baal’s Caress allows the Kindred to
transmute her blood into a virulent ichor that destroys
any living or undead flesh it touches. In nights of yore,
when Assamites led the charges of Saracen legions, the
Assassins were often seen licking their blades, slicing
open their tongues and lubricating their weapons with
this foul secretion.
Baal’s Caress may be used to augment any bladed
weapon; everything from poisoned knives and swords
to tainted fingernails and claws has been reported.
System: Baal’s Caress does not increase the damage
done by a given weapon, but that weapon inflicts aggravated damage rather than normal. No roll is necessary to activate this power, but one blood point is
consumed per hit. For example, if a Cainite poisons his
knife and strikes his opponent (even if he inflicts no
damage), one blood point’s worth of lubrication disappears. For this reason, many vampires choose to coat

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

their weapons with a significant quantity of blood. If
the vampire misses, no tainted blood is consumed.

••••• Taste of Death
A refinement of Baal’s Caress, Taste of Death allows
the Cainite to spit caustic blood at her target. The
blood coughed forth with this power burns flesh and
corrodes bone; some vampires have been reported to
vomit voluminous streams of vitae that reduce their
targets to heaps of sludge.
System: The vampire may spit up to 10 feet (3 meters) for each dot of Strength and Potence he possesses.
Hitting the target requires a Stamina + Athletics roll
(difficulty 6). Each blood point spewed at the target
inflicts two dice of aggravated damage, and there is no
limit (other than the vampire’s capacity and per-turn
expenditure maximum) to the quantity of blood with
which a target may be deluged.

••••• • Blood Sweat
Although vampires do not have functioning sebaceous glands, they are still capable of sweating at
times of extreme stress. This “sweat” is actually a thin
sheen of blood on the Cainite’s forehead and palms.
Most Kindred see blood sweat as an admission of fear
or guilt. The vampire who has mastered Blood Sweat is
capable of inducing these feelings in a subject to a preternatural degree. The victim experiences a torrential
outpouring of vitae if he harbors the tiniest shred of
remorse for any action he has ever undertaken.
System: The character must be within line of sight
of the subject and spend three turns concentrating.
The player spends a Willpower point and rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty equal to the target’s
current Willpower points). The target loses one blood
point per success. Mortals sustain injury as if they had
lost blood from being fed upon. The target actually
“sweats out” the lost blood in a sudden rush of sanguinary perspiration that soaks his clothes. Large amounts
may even form puddles at his feet. Blood lost through
this process is considered dead, inert mortal blood, and
provides minimal nutrition (half normal) for Cainites
desperate enough to lick it up from the floor or wring
it out of towels. It provides no sustenance for the individual from whom it emerged.
In addition to the blood loss, the victim is overcome
by a sense of remorse and guilt for his past transgressions (if he has a strong conscience) or an overwhelming compulsion to brag (if he is of sufficiently coarse
moral character). The severity of this impulse depends

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

205

on the number of successes rolled: One success could
cause a slight twinge of conscience, while five successes
may result in the subject breaking down and pouring
out a full confession of his crimes. This effect is more
story-oriented than mechanical, and the Storyteller is
the final authority on what the victim feels compelled
to confess or boast.
Note that this power’s existence is not widely known.
Vampires and mortals alike tend to shrink away from
someone who begins spontaneously sweating blood,
and experiencing such an affliction may panic even the
staunchest individual.

••••• • Selective Silence
Although Silence of Death is an effective tool for
the battlefield and the court alike, it is indiscriminate
in its effects. The assassin who uses it in preparation
for firing a shotgun also silences the radio over which
her comrades might warn her of an oncoming guard.
The courtier who suppresses a room full of dissenting
voices is likewise unable to speak her own mind. Selective Silence allows the skilled Cainite to overcome
these limitations by silencing only those individuals or
objects that she wants to silence.
When using this power, most individuals exhale a
thin mist of blood that clings to the selected subjects,
gradually evaporating as Selective Silence’s effects
fade. Some vampires also use a similar technique when
invoking Silence of Death, in which case the mist surrounds them and moves with them.
System: The player spends two blood points and
rolls Stamina + Stealth (difficulty 7). Each success allows for one individual or object that the character can
silence with this use of the power. Each subject must
be within 20 yards or meters of the character. Objects
larger than a man count as more than one subject: a
heavy machine gun counts as two, a car as three, and
a small aircraft as five. Objects larger than a private jet
or creatures larger than an elephant cannot be silenced
through the use of this power.
Each subject is completely silenced for a number of
minutes equal to the character’s permanent Willpower.
Nothing it does generates sound, though the secondary
effects of its actions will do so normally. For example, a
gun silenced with this power will not produce an audible explosion when fired, but its bullets still make noise
as they break the sound barrier. A silenced victim can
scream all he likes and not make a sound, but may be
able to summon help by smashing a window.

206

••••• • Ripples of the Heart
According to Assamite lore, this technique originated with a Byzantine scholar who wanted to protect
his herd from the thirst of other Cainites. Ripples of
the Heart allows a Cainite to leave emotions within
the bloodstream of any mortal from whom he feeds.
Any other vampire who subsequently drinks from that
mortal experiences those emotions as if they were his
own.
System: The character drinks at least one blood
point from the subject mortal then spends a minute in
physical contact with the subject while concentrating
on the emotion he wishes to leave in her blood. The
player spends a point of Willpower and rolls Charisma
+ Empathy (difficulty 7 under normal circumstances,
5 if the subject is currently experiencing the intended
emotion, 9 if he is currently experiencing a strong opposite emotion). The subject’s blood carries the weight
of the intended emotion for one lunar month per success rolled. A mortal’s blood can only carry one emotion at a time. Subsequent attempts to use Ripples of
the Heart on the same individual have no effect until
the previous application has worn off.
Any vampire who drinks from a vessel under the effects of Ripples of the Heart must succeed in a SelfControl/Instinct roll (difficulty of the mortal’s current
Willpower points) as soon as she swallows the first
blood point. If she fails this roll, the vitae-borne emotion immediately overtakes her. The strength of the
emotion depends on how many blood points she drinks.
One blood point results in a momentary mood swing,
two causes a significant shift in demeanor, and three
or more generates a complete change in emotional
state. Depending on the circumstances and the precise
emotion, the effects of this may be spectacular or catastrophic. A vampire overtaken by romantic passion
may temporarily believe she is in love with the mortal
(or any other convenient bystander). One who drinks
from a hate-infused vessel may rend her prey to shreds,
and one who takes a draught of a mortal touched with
fear may run away screaming. The vampire remains
subject to the emotion for a number of hours equal to
the mortal’s permanent Willpower, though she is still
subject to other feelings after the initial rush of sensation.
The mortal who is under the effects of Ripples of the
Heart is unaware of the power’s effects on him, though
he is slightly predisposed toward the emotion in question while the power is in effect. The vampire who

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

used Ripples of the Heart on a mortal is immune to any
effects from that use.

••••• • Purification
Although most mortal cultures affix negative connotations to the spilling of blood, most Assamites
— indeed, most vampires — have quite the opposite
reaction to it. For them, blood is an unlife-affirming
and reinvigorating substance. Purification works on
this principle, using the power of vitae to cleanse and
restore. Rather than purging foreign taints from the
body, Purification allows its wielder to cleanse other
individuals’ minds and souls of stains, including those
left by the mind control of other Kindred. The vampire
using this power expels his own blood through his skin
and allows it to soak through his subject, slowly dissipating. As it does so, it carries away spiritual impurities
and outside influences.
System: The character touches the forehead of her
intended subject, and both parties spend a minimum of
five minutes in deep concentration. The player spends
a number of blood points equal to the subject’s permanent Willpower. The subject rolls Willpower once for
every external supernatural influence (a vampiric Discipline, usually) to which his mind has been subjected.
The difficulty equals the level of the power in question
+4 (or a difficulty of 7 if the power level is unknown,
such as one used by a different kind of supernatural
creature). A success nullifies that effect.
Purification has its limits. It can remove directly intrusive influences such as Dominate-implanted commands, Dementation-generated derangements, or the
imperatives caused by elder vampires’ Presence. It cannot dispel influences that are transmitted by blood, including a blood bond or the dispositions imparted by
one’s Clan or bloodline, nor can it erase those caused
by purely mundane techniques such as persuasion,
hypnosis, or brainwashing, or genuine emotional states
such as love and hate. It can remove mind-altering
blood magic effects, but either the character wielding Purification or the power’s beneficiary must have
a level of Thaumaturgy equal to or greater than that
with which the effect was placed. A character cannot
use Purification on herself.

••••• •• Baal’s Bloody Talons
The toxin generated by Baal’s Caress is not enough to
significantly harm some truly fearsome foes. This progressive development of that lesser technique allows its
user to envenom his weapon with a blood-based poison
so potent that it corrodes the very weapon that bears

it, eating away at the strongest metal in a minute or
less. However, its effects on its victims are spectacular
enough to make the loss of even the most treasured
blades worthwhile. This power’s effects are of very limited duration, as the substance it creates will quickly
evaporate away.
System: The character coats an edged weapon with
her own blood, as per Baal’s Caress. The player spends
one or more blood points and rolls Willpower (difficulty 7). The weapon now does aggravated damage. It also
gains a number of additional damage dice equal to the
number of successes rolled plus the number of blood
points spent. These extra dice fade at a rate of one per
turn as the poison dissipates, drips off, and reacts with
the weapon’s material. Once the extra damage dice
are all gone, the weapon’s base damage dice begin to
fade at the same rate. The weapon breaks if used when
its base damage is reduced to the wielder’s Strength or
less. The only weapons that can resist this corrosion
are those created with a supernatural power of a level
equal to or greater than the character’s Quietus rating,
though even this is subject to the Storyteller’s discretion.
Baal’s Bloody Talons is subject to the same limitations as Baal’s Caress, except the limit on the number of successful strikes that do aggravated damage. A
weapon affected by Baal’s Bloody Talons does aggravated damage with every successful attack until it is
destroyed.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, the character may use
the venom this power produces for other purposes, such
as burning through a padlock or destroying an incriminating tape. He may not, however, store this poison for
later use — even if a container proves resistant to it,
the substance becomes inert within a few minutes of
leaving its creator’s body.

••••• •• Poison the Well of Life
Beyond leaving emotional traces in a subject’s blood,
the master of this Quietus power can now taint that
same vitae, making it into a deadly poison for any other
Cainite who drinks from that mortal. Some vampires
use Poison the Well of Life to guard their own herds
against “poachers” or to ward specific vessels against
indiscriminate feeding. Others have been known to
employ it as a subtle trap for other vampires, turning
herds against their owners.
System: The character touches the mortal he wishes
to taint and smears a streak of his own vitae on the
victim’s skin. The player spends three blood points

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

207

and rolls Stamina + Occult (difficulty 7). For a number of months equal to the number of successes, any
other vampire who drinks that mortal’s blood sustains
two health levels of aggravated damage for every blood
point imbibed. This damage manifests as a combination of acid burns and something akin to toxic shock.
While a mortal is poisonous to vampires, his body’s
alchemical balance is slightly altered toward toxicity.
He gains two extra points of Stamina for the purposes
of resisting the effects and damage of poisons and acids.
However, his bodily excretions, especially his sweat,
are slightly more noxious than normal. He suffers a
one-die penalty to all Social dice pools if whomever
he chooses to interact with has a particularly sensitive
nose and is close enough to smell him.

••••• ••• Songs of Distant Vitae
Blood magic practitioners and individuals skilled at
Auspex have long known that vitae can carry residual
impressions of emotion and personality. This power
invokes those impressions to overwhelm its victim
with “remembered” images and sensations drawn from
the vessels who held that blood before the vampire
fed from them. Particularly strong-willed or hardened
subjects may shrug off these visions as daydreams, but
those who are less self-possessed can be permanently
changed by the experience. A side effect of the use of
this power is the partial destruction of the vitae from
which the images are drawn. Some viziers theorize that
this is the result of motes of the vessels’ consciousness
making an effort to escape their usurper.
System: The character touches his target and spends
a turn in concentration. The player spends four blood
points and rolls Wits + Intimidation in a contested
roll against the victim’s permanent Willpower (difficulty 7). If the target has committed diablerie within a
number of nights equal to the character’s Perception,
the attacker gains one automatic success. The result
depends on the number of net successes the attacker
rolls. Note that in all invocations of this power, the
sensations that the subject relives are expressly negative and terrifying — for example, he experiences none
of the pleasure that would normally accompany the
Kiss when he flashes back to such an event.
In addition to the effects listed below, the subject of
a successful attack loses a number of blood points equal
to the number of successes rolled. This vitae oozes from
his body in warm red trickles that do no damage but are
certain to terrify onlookers.

Result
The attacker enters a flashback

permanent derangement related to
feeding.

Failure
		
		

The target is unharmed and immune
to this power for a number of nights
equal to his Willpower.

1 success
		
		
		
		

The target experiences a brief (10second/3-turn) flashback sequence in
which he relives his last feeding from
the vessel’s point of view. During this
time, he is at +2 difficulty to all rolls.

The target experiences a brief 		
montage (15 seconds/5 turns) of
flashbacks during which his viewpoint
flashes between various feedings from
the vessels’ points of view. During
this time, he is at +3 difficulty to all
rolls. Once the initial rush of

upon whom he has ever fed. He must
make a successful Self-Control/		
Instinct roll (difficulty 9) or fall into
torpor for (10 - the target’s Stamina)
nights, at the end of which he loses
half his permanent Willpower and
gains the derangement Sanguinary
Animism. If he succeeds on the 		
Self-Control/Instinct roll, he enters
Rötschreck for the rest of the night,
during which time his greatest fear is
of his own image. At the end of the
night, he must succeed at a 		
Willpower roll (difficulty 9) or lose a
permanent Willpower point and gain
the derangement Sanguinary 		
Animism.

••••• •••• Condemn the Sins of
the Father
Although the Second City’s judges recognized that
heritage does not equal guilt, they also encountered
many situations in which a vampire’s entire brood had
committed the same crime. In such cases, the judges
often decreed the same punishment for all transgressors. This technique, which modern viziers believe to
have originated at that time, allows its wielder to administer such judgments. Through Condemn the Sins
of the Father, a Cainite can apply lesser Quietus powers to an entire lineage.
System: After successfully using any lesser Quietus
power on another vampire, the player spends a permanent Willpower point and 10 blood points and rolls
Stamina + Occult. The difficulty of this roll is equal
to four plus the number of Generations of the original
target’s descendants that the player wants to affect, up
to a maximum difficulty of 10. If the roll succeeds, every descendant of the original target within the specified range of Generations suffers the same effects that
the original target experienced, resisting with his own
relevant Traits. The player may exempt a number of
potential subjects from this effect equal to twice the
character’s Wits, but the character must know their
faces or have tasted their vitae.

Serpentis
Serpentis is believed to be the legacy of Set himself, a
gift to his children. The Followers of Set are very careful to guard this Discipline’s secrets, only teaching the
art to those who they deem worthy. Most vampires fear
the Setites because of the powers of Serpentis and its
connection to snakes and reptiles; this Discipline can
evoke a primordial fear in others, particularly those
who recall the tale of Eden.

• The Eyes of the Serpent
This power grants the vampire the legendary hypnotic gaze of the serpent. The Kindred’s eyes become
gold with large black irises, and mortals in the character’s vicinity find themselves strangely attracted to
him. A mortal who meets the vampire’s beguiling gaze
is immobilized. Until the character takes his eyes off
his victim, the person is frozen in place.
System: No roll is required, but this power can be
avoided if the mortal takes care not to look into the
vampire’s eyes. Vampires and other supernatural creatures can also be affected by this power if the Cainite’s
player succeeds on a Willpower roll (difficulty 9). If attacked or otherwise harmed, supernatural creatures can
spend a point of Willpower to break the spell.
Note: This is different than normal eye contact detailed on p. 152. The target must be able to see the
vampire’s eyes for Eyes of the Serpent to work.

•• The Tongue of the Asp
The vampire may lengthen her tongue at will, splitting it into a fork like that of a serpent. The tongue
may reach 18 inches or half a meter, and makes a terrifyingly effective weapon in close combat.
System: The lash of the tongue’s razor fork causes aggravated wounds (difficulty 6, Strength damage). If the
Kindred wounds her enemy, she may drink blood from
the target on the next turn as though she had sunk her
fangs into the victim’s neck. Horrifying though it is, the
tongue’s caress is very like the Kiss, and strikes mortal
victims helpless with fear and ecstasy. Additionally,
the tongue is highly sensitive to vibrations, enabling
the vampire to function effectively in the darkness the
Clan prefers. By flicking his tongue in and out of his
mouth, the vampire can halve any penalties relating to
darkness (p. 274).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

209

••• The Skin of the Adder
By calling upon her Blood, the vampire may transform her skin into a mottled, scaly hide. A vampire in
this form becomes more supple and flexible.
System: The vampire spends one blood point and
one Willpower point. Her skin becomes scaly and
mottled; this, combined with the character’s increased
flexibility, reduces soak difficulties to 5. The vampire
may use her Stamina to soak aggravated damage from
claws and fangs, but not from fire, sunlight, or other supernatural energies. The vampire’s mouth widens and
fangs lengthen, enabling her bite to inflict an extra die
of damage. Finally, the vampire may slip through any
opening wide enough to fit her head through.
The vampire’s Appearance drops to 1, and she is obviously inhuman if observed with any degree of care,
though casual passersby might not notice, if the vampire is in darkness or wearing heavy clothing.

•••• The Form of the Cobra
The Cainite may change his form into that of a huge
black cobra. The serpent weighs as much as the vampire’s human form, stretches over 10 feet or three meters long, and is about 20 inches (50 cm) around. The

210

Form of the Cobra grants several advantages, including
a venomous bite, the ability to slither through small
spaces, and a greatly enhanced sense of smell. The
character may use any Disciplines while in this form
save those that require hands (such as Feral Claws).
System: The vampire spends one blood point; the
change is automatic, but takes three turns. Clothing
and small personal possessions transform with the vampire. The vampire remains in serpent form until the
next dawn, unless he desires to change back sooner.
The Storyteller may allow the Setite bonus dice on all
Perception rolls related to smell, but the difficulties for
all hearing rolls are increased by two. The cobra’s bite
inflicts damage equal to the vampire’s, but the vampire
does not need to grapple his victim; furthermore, the
poison delivered is fatal to mortals.

••••• The Heart of Darkness
A Kindred with mastery of Serpentis may pull her
heart from her body. She can even use this ability on
other Cainites, although this requires several hours of
gruesome surgery. This power can only be invoked during a new moon. If performed under any other moon,
the rite fails. Upon removing her heart, the vampire
places it in a small clay urn, and then carefully hides or

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

buries the urn. While her heart is hidden, she cannot
be staked by any wood that pierces her breast. Moreover, because the heart is the seat of emotion, the difficulties of all her rolls to resist frenzy are two lower
while this power is in effect.
Cainites are careful to keep their hearts safe from
danger. If someone seizes her heart, the vampire is
completely at that person’s mercy. The heart can be
destroyed only by casting it into a fire or exposing it to
sunlight. If this happens, the Kindred dies where she
stands, boiling away into a blistering heap of ash and
blackened bone. Plunging a wooden stake into an exposed heart drives the vampire into instant torpor.
A vampire may carry her heart with her, or have
several false hearts buried in different places. A smart
Kindred often avoids her heart’s hiding place, to deter
discovery. Those wise in Setite lore whisper that the
corrupt elders of the Clan often hold their underlings’
hearts as yet another method of control.
System: This power requires no roll. Those who witness a vampire pull his heart from his breast (or cut
the heart from another vampire) must make Courage
rolls. Failure indicates anything from strong uneasiness
to complete revulsion, possibly even Rötschreck.

••••• • Cobra Fangs
A character using Form of the Cobra gains a venomous bite along with his serpentine form. Unfortunately,
huge black cobras tend to make people run away as fast
as they can. This Serpentis power enables a vampire
to gain the deadly bite without the full-body transformation, making it more useful for taking victims by
surprise. The police do ask questions when someone
dies from a cobra bite under unlikely circumstances, so
Cobra Fangs still requires some discretion in its use.
System: The Kindred expends one blood point, and
in one turn his fangs become hollow, more slender and
venomous. The vampire injects venom when he bites.
He must still grapple with the victim to deliver a bite
attack, and the bite does the usual amount of damage;
the venom, however, kills mortals within one minute.
Bitten vampires or other supernaturally resilient creatures suffer (10 – victim’s Stamina and Fortitude) levels
of aggravated damage over the course of five minutes.

••••• •• Divine Image
Many of the low-Generation Setite elders no longer need the illusions of Obfuscate to appear as a god.
Through this Serpentis power, a vampire can physically metamorphose into the form of a god. Male Kindred

generally take the form of Set himself: a muscular man
with the head of the “Typhonic Beast,” an animal with
a long, narrow snout and upstanding, square-topped
ears. Less often, they take the form of the crocodileheaded god Sobek, whom the Egyptians often linked
to Set, or the wolf-headed war-god Wepwawet, often
identified with Set’s son Anubis. Female vampires generally assume the form of the cobra-headed goddess
Renenet, wife of Sobek, or the hippopotamus-goddess
Taweret, sometimes considered a consort of Set. Both
were goddesses of pregnancy and childbirth. Setite
doctrine labels all four deities as Set’s eldest childer.
While assuming the Divine Image, the vampire becomes stronger, tougher, and more impressive. More
importantly, perhaps, the vampire’s will becomes more
powerful as he identifies with a divine forebear.
System: The character expends three blood points
and transforms into the Divine Image in one turn. In
the Divine Image, the vampire gains two dots each of
Strength and Stamina and a dot each of Charisma and
Manipulation, but her Appearance drops to 1. These
enhancements can push the vampire over his generational limit. The character also gains two full dots of
Willpower (to a maximum of 10). The Cainite can stay
in the Divine Image for a full scene.
A vampire has only one Divine Image form (unless
the player buys this power twice). The character does
not know what Divine Image he will manifest until he
invokes the power the first time, although the player
can freely choose the preferred form.

••••• ••• Heart Thief
The Serpentis power Heart of Darkness normally
takes hours to perform upon other vampires, and only
works at the dark of the moon. Some elders, however,
can pull the heart from another vampire’s chest with
a quick snatch. This does not destroy the victim, unless the attacker then destroys the stolen heart. Heart
Thief is not an easy power to use despite its speed, but
few Discipline effects can place one vampire in another’s power so suddenly and completely.
System: The character must expend one Willpower
point. Removing the heart of a reluctant vampire is a
difficult feat, comparable to staking: the attacker must
garner at least three successes on a Dexterity + Brawl
attack (difficulty 9). The victim may use Fortitude to
“soak” the attacker’s successes, but mundane Stamina
has no effect against this magical attack.
A vampire who loses his heart this way takes one
unsoakable level of aggravated damage, and receives

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

211

all the benefits and drawbacks of the Heart of Darkness
power. Resisting frenzy becomes easier (-2 difficulty)
and he cannot be staked by wood that impales his
breast. On the other hand, thrusting a stake through
the removed heart will instantly force the vampire into
torpor and exposing the heart to fire or sunlight will
bum the vampire to ash; even biting into the heart will
cause aggravated wounds to the vampire in question.

••••• •••• Shadow of Apep
Only Set and Set’s own childer can perform this terrifying power. These ancient monsters can take the form
of Set’s defeated enemy, Apep. The vampire becomes
a giant serpent of fluid, glittering Darkness — not mere
shadow, but anti-light, like the black force commanded
by Obtenebration. In this form, physical force cannot
harm the vampire: not claws or fangs, not bullets, not
explosions, nothing but fire, sunlight, or mystical powers. Physical barriers cannot easily stop the vampire,
whose shadowy form can seep through even the tiniest
crack. The vampire, however, can still exert physical
and supernatural force quite freely.
System: Taking the form of Apep costs a Willpower
point. The transformation takes three turns to complete; once the vampire has transformed, her body remains changed for one scene. In this form, the vampire
takes no damage from any physical attack: fists, weapons, or falling buildings pass through the vampire as if
she were a shadow. Fire and sunlight inflict the normal aggravated damage, however, and mystical powers (such as Thaumaturgy) still affect the transformed
vampire. The vampire’s new body gains three dots in
each Physical Attribute. Ignore generational limits for
this purpose. The transformed vampire can use her
Strength to make normal close combat attacks and
can bite for Strength + 2 dice of damage. The vampire
can also employ any Discipline that does not require
hands.

Thaumaturgy
Thaumaturgy encompasses blood magic and other
sorcerous arts available to Kindred. The Tremere Clan
is best known for their possession (and jealous hoarding) of this Discipline. The Tremere created Thaumaturgy by combining mortal wizardry with the power
of vampiric vitae, and as a result it is a versatile and
powerful Discipline. Although there are whispers of
the existence of Tremere antitribu in the Sabbat, other
Clans in the Sword of Caine have also researched and

212

developed access to such mystical might. Nevertheless,
the Tremere of the Camarilla remain this Discipline’s
masters.
Like Necromancy, the practice of Thaumaturgy is
divided into paths and rituals. Thaumaturgical paths
are applications of the vampire’s knowledge of blood
magic, allowing her to create effects on a whim. Rituals are more formulaic in nature, most akin to ancient
magical “spells.” Because so many different paths and
rituals are available to the arcane Tremere, one never
knows what to expect when confronted with a practitioner of this Discipline.
When a character first learns Thaumaturgy, the player selects a path for the character. That path is considered the character’s primary path, and she automatically receives one dot in it, as well as one Level One
ritual. Thereafter, whenever the character increases
her level in Thaumaturgy, her rating in the primary
path increases by one as well. Additional rituals are
learned separately, as part of a story; players need not
pay experience points for their characters to learn rituals up to the level equal to their overall rating in Thaumaturgy, though they must find someone to teach the
rituals in question. Path ratings never exceed 5, though
the overall Thaumaturgy score may. If a character
reaches a rating of 5 in her primary path and increases
her Thaumaturgy score afterward, she may allocate her
“free” path dot to a different path. (Experience costs
are covered on p. 124.)
Many Kindred fear crossing the practitioners of
Thaumaturgy. It is a very potent and mutable Discipline, and almost anything the Kindred wishes may be
accomplished through its magic.

Thaumaturgical Paths
Paths define the types of magic a vampire can perform. A vampire typically learns his primary path from
his sire, though it is not unknown for some vampires to
study under many different tutors.
As mentioned before, the first path a character learns
is considered her primary path and increases automatically as the character advances in the Discipline itself.
Secondary paths may be learned once the character
has acquired two or more dots in her primary path, and
they must be raised separately with experience points.
Furthermore, a character’s rating in her primary path
must always be at least one dot higher than any of her
secondary paths until she has mastered her primary
path. Once the character has achieved the fifth level

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

of her primary path, secondary paths may be increased
to that level.
Each time the character invokes one of the powers
of a Thaumaturgical path, the thaumaturge’s player
must spend a blood point and make a Willpower roll
against a difficulty equal to the power’s level +3. Only
one success is required to invoke a path’s effect — path
levels, not successes, govern the power of blood magic.
Failure on this roll indicates that the magic fails. A
botch causes some kind of loss or catastrophic backfire,
such as losing a Willpower point (or dot!), spontaneous combustion, or accidentally letting a living statue
run rampant. Thaumaturgy is an unforgiving art.
Various Sects and Clans have different access to each
path, but unless the Storyteller decides otherwise, it is
assumed the Tremere have some access to all of them.
(“Having access” does not mean the same thing as “easily gained,” especially within the Tremere power structure.) The paths start with one of the most common
(The Path of Blood), and thereafter are presented in alphabetical order. (The unusual “path” of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is also presented, although it is considered a separate Discipline – see p. 228 for details.)

The Path of Blood
Almost every Tremere studies the Path of Blood as
her primary path. It encompasses some of the most fundamental principles of Thaumaturgy, based as it is on
the manipulation of Kindred vitae. If a player wishes to
select another path as her character’s primary path, the
Storyteller may require additional reasoning (though
choosing a different path is by no means unheard of).

• A Taste for Blood
This power was developed as a means of testing a
foe’s might — an extremely important ability in the
tumultuous early nights of Clan Tremere. By merely
touching the blood of his subject, the caster may determine how much vitae remains in the subject and, if
the subject is a vampire, how recently he has fed, his
approximate Generation and, with three or more successes, whether he has ever committed diablerie.
System: The number of successes achieved on the
roll determines how much information the thaumaturge gleans and how accurate it is.

•• Blood Rage
This power allows a vampire to force another Kindred to expend blood against his will. The caster must

touch her subject for this power to work, though only
the lightest contact is necessary. A vampire affected
by this power might feel a physical rush as the thaumaturge heightens his Physical Attributes, might find
himself suddenly looking more human, or may even
find himself on the brink of frenzy as his stores of vitae
are mystically depleted.
System: Each success forces the subject to spend one
blood point immediately in the way the caster desires
(which must go towards some logical expenditure the
target vampire could make, such as increasing Physical
Attributes or powering Disciplines). Note that blood
points forcibly spent in this manner may exceed the
normal “per turn” maximum indicated by the victim’s
Generation. Each success gained also increases the
subject’s difficulty to resist frenzy by one. The thaumaturge may not use Blood Rage on herself to circumvent
generational limits.

••• Blood of Potency
The thaumaturge gains such control over his own
blood that he may effectively “concentrate” it, making it more powerful for a short time. In effect, he may
temporarily lower his own Generation with this power.
This power may be used only once per night.
System: One success on the Willpower roll allows
the character to lower his Generation by one step for
one hour. Each additional success grants the Kindred
either one step down in Generation or one hour of effect. Successes earned must be spent both to decrease
the vampire’s Generation and to maintain the change
(this power cannot be activated again until the original application wears off). If the vampire is diablerized
while this power is in effect, it wears off immediately
and the diablerist gains power appropriate to the caster’s actual Generation. Furthermore, any mortals Embraced by the thaumaturge are born to the Generation
appropriate to their sire’s original Generation (e.g., a
Tenth-Generation Tremere who has reduced his effective Generation to Eighth still produces EleventhGeneration childer).
Once the effect wears off, any blood over the character’s blood pool maximum dilutes, leaving the character at his regular blood pool maximum. Thus, if a
Twelfth-Generation Tremere (maximum blood pool
of 11) decreased his Generation to Ninth (maximum
blood pool 14), ingested 14 blood points, and had this
much vitae in his system when the power wore off, his
blood pool would immediately drop to 11.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

213

•••• Theft of Vitae
A thaumaturge using this power siphons vitae from
her subject. She need never come in contact with the
subject — blood literally streams out in a physical torrent from the subject to the Kindred (though it is often
mystically absorbed and need not enter through the
mouth).
System: The number of successes determines how
many blood points the caster transfers from the subject. The subject must be visible to the thaumaturge
and within 50 feet (15 meters). Using this power prevents the caster from being blood-bound, but otherwise counts as if the vampire ingested the blood herself. This power is spectacularly obvious, and Camarilla
princes justifiably consider its public use a breach of
the Masquerade.

••••• Cauldron of Blood
A thaumaturge using this power boils her subject’s
blood in his veins like water on a stove. The Kindred
must touch her subject, and it is this contact that simmers the subject’s blood. This power is always fatal to
mortals, and causes great damage to even the mightiest
vampires.
System: The number of successes gained determines
how many blood points are brought to boil. The subject suffers one health level of aggravated damage for
each point boiled (individuals with Fortitude may soak
this damage using only their Fortitude dice). A single
success kills any mortal, though some ghouls with access to Fortitude are said to have survived after soaking
all of the aggravated damage.

and Stamina. The number of successes on the roll to
activate the power is the number of turns these dots
remain. The player may spend a Willpower point to
increase this duration by one turn. This power cannot
be “stacked” — one application must expire before the
next can be made.

•• Wooden Tongues
A vampire may speak, albeit in limited fashion, with
the spirit of any inanimate object. The conversation
may not be incredibly interesting, as most rocks and
chairs have limited concern for what occurs around
them, but the vampire can get at least a general impression of what the subject has “experienced.” Note
that events which are significant to a vampire may not
be the same events that interest a lawn gnome.
System: The number of successes dictates the amount
and relevance of the information that the character receives. One success may yield a boulder’s memory of a
forest fire, while three may indicate that it remembers
a shadowy figure running past, and five will cause the
rock to relate a precise description of a local Gangrel.

••• Animate the Unmoving
Objects affected by this power move as the vampire
using it dictates. An object cannot take an action that
would be completely inconceivable for something with
its form — for instance, a door could not leap from
its hinges and carry someone across a street. However,
seemingly solid objects can become flexible within reason: Barstools can run with their legs, guns can twist
out of their owners’ hands or fire while holstered, and
humanoid statues can move like normal humans.

This path allows a vampire limited control over and
communion with inanimate objects. Elemental Mastery can only be used to affect the unliving — a vampire could not cause a tree to walk by using Animate
the Unmoving, for instance. Thaumaturges who seek
mastery over living things generally study paths such
as The Green Path (p. 215).

System: This power requires the expenditure of a
Willpower point with less than four successes on the
roll. Each use of this power animates one object no
larger than human-sized; the caster may simultaneously control a number of animate objects equal to his Intelligence rating. Objects animated by this power stay
animated as long as they are within the caster’s line of
sight or up to an hour, although the thaumaturge can
take other actions during that time.

• Elemental Strength

•••• Elemental Form

Elemental Mastery

The vampire can draw upon the strength and resilience of the earth, or of the objects around him, to increase his physical prowess without the need for large
amounts of blood.

The vampire can take the shape of any inanimate
object of a mass roughly equal to her own. A desk, a
statue, or a bicycle would be feasible, but a house or a
pen would be beyond this power’s capacity.

System: The player allocates a total of three temporary bonus dots between the character’s Strength

to counterfeit. At least three successes are required for

The elemental performs any task that
the caster sets for it, even one that
may take several nights to complete
or that places its existence at risk.

A vampire may summon one of the traditional spirits of the elements: a salamander (fire), a sylph (air),
a gnome (earth), or an undine (water). Some thaumaturges claim to have contacted elemental spirits of
glass, electricity, blood, and even atomic energy, but
such reports remain unconfirmed (even as their authors are summoned to Vienna for questioning). The
caster may choose what type of elemental he wishes to
summon and command.
System: The character must be near some quantity
of the classical element corresponding to the spirit
he wishes to invoke. The spirit invoked may or may
not actually follow the caster’s instructions once summoned, but generally will at least pay rough attention
to what it’s being told to do. The number of successes
gained on the Willpower roll determines the power
level of the elemental.
The elemental has three dots in all Physical and
Mental Attributes. One dot may be added to one of
the elemental’s Physical Attributes for each success
gained by the caster on the initial roll. The Storyteller
should determine the elemental’s Abilities, attacks,
and damage, and any special powers it has related to
its element.
Once the elemental has been summoned, the thaumaturge must exert control over it. The more powerful the elemental, the more difficult a task this is. The
player rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty of the
number of successes scored on the casting roll + 4),
and the number of successes determines the degree of
control:

The Green Path
The Green Path deals with the manipulation of
plant matter of all sorts. Anything more complex than
an algae bloom can theoretically be controlled through
the appropriate application of this path. Ferns, roses,
dandelions, and even ancient redwoods are all valid
targets for this path’s powers, and living and dead plant
matter are equally affected. While not as immediately
impressive as some other more widely practiced paths,
the Green Path (sometimes disparagingly referred to as
“Botanical Mastery”) is as subtle and powerful as the
natural world which it affects.

• Herbal Wisdom
With a touch, a vampire can commune with the
spirit of a plant. Conversations held in this manner are
often cryptic but rewarding — the wisdom and experience of the spirits of some trees surpasses that of the
oracles of legend. Crabgrass, on the other hand, rarely
has much insight to offer, but might reveal the appearance of the last person who trod upon it.
System: The number of successes rolled determines
the amount of information that can be gained from the
contact. Depending on the precise information that
the vampire seeks, the Storyteller might require the
player to roll Intelligence + Occult in order to interpret the results of the communication.

•• Speed the Season’s Passing
This power allows a thaumaturge to accelerate a plant’s
growth, causing roses to bloom in a matter of minutes or
trees to shoot up from saplings overnight. Alternately,
she can speed a plant’s death and decay, withering grass
and crumbling wooden stakes with but a touch.
System: The character touches the target plant. The
player rolls normally, and the number of successes determines the amount of growth or decay. One success
gives the plant a brief growth spurt or simulates the effects of harsh weather, while three noticeably enlarge
or wither it. With five successes, a full-grown plant
springs from a seed or crumbles to dust in a few minutes, and a tree sprouts fruit or begins decaying almost
instantaneously. If this power is used in combat, three
successes are needed to render a wooden weapon completely useless. Two successes suffice to weaken it, while
five cause it to disintegrate in the wielder’s hand.

••• Dance of Vines
The thaumaturge can animate a mass of vegetation
up to his own size, using it for utilitarian or combat purposes with equal ease. Leaves can walk along a desktop,
ivy can act as a scribe, and jungle creepers can strangle

216

opponents. Intruders should beware of Tremere workshops that harbor potted rowan saplings.
System: Any total amount of vegetation with a mass
less than or equal to the character’s own may be animated through this power. The plants stay active for one turn
per success scored on the roll, and are under the complete
control of the character. If used for combat purposes, the
plants have Strength and Dexterity ratings each equal
to half the character’s Willpower (rounded down) and
Brawl ratings one lower than that of the character.
Dance of Vines cannot make plants uproot themselves and go stomping about. Even the most energetic
vegetation is incapable of pulling out of the soil and
walking under the effect of this power. However, 200
pounds (100 kilograms) of kudzu can cover a considerable area all by itself….

•••• Verdant Haven
This power weaves a temporary shelter out of a sufficient
amount of plant matter. In addition to providing physical
protection from the elements (and even sunlight), the
Verdant Haven also establishes a mystical barrier which
is nearly impassable to anyone the caster wishes to exclude. A Verdant Haven appears as a six-foot-tall (twometer-tall) hemisphere of interlocked branches, leaves,

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

and vines with no discernible opening, and even to the
casual observer it appears to be an unnatural construction. Verdant Havens are rumored to have supernatural
healing properties, hut no Kindred have reported experiencing such benefits from a stay in one.

managed to learn the secrets of this path over the centuries. The Hands of Destruction has an infamous history, and some Tremere refuse to practice it due to rumors that it is demonic in origin.

• Decay

System: A character must be standing in a heavily
vegetated area to use this power. The Verdant Haven
springs up around the character over the course of three
turns. Once the haven is established, anyone wishing
to enter the haven without the caster’s permission
must achieve more than the caster’s original number of
successes on a single roll of Wits + Survival (difficulty
equal to the caster’s Willpower). The haven lasts until
the next sunset, or until the caster dispels or leaves it.
If the caster scored four or more successes, the haven is
impenetrable to sunlight unless physically breached.

System: If the roll is successful, the inanimate object touched by the thaumaturge ages 10 years for every
minute the Kindred touches it. If the vampire breaks
physical contact and wishes to age the object again,
another blood point must be spent and another roll
must be made. This power does not affect vampires.

••••• Awaken the Forest Giants

•• Gnarl Wood

This power accelerates the decrepitude of its target,
causing it to wither, rot, or otherwise break down. The
target must be inanimate, though dead organic matter
can be affected.

Entire trees can be animated by a master of the
Green Path. Ancient oaks can be temporarily given
the gift of movement, pulling their roots from the soil
and shaking the ground with their steps. While not as
versatile as elementals or other summoned spirits, trees
brought to ponderous life via this power display awesome strength and resilience.

This power warps and bends wooden objects.
Though the wood is otherwise undamaged, this power
often leaves the objects completely useless. This power
may also be used to swell or contract wood, in addition to bending it into unwholesome shapes. Unlike
other powers of this path, Gnarl Wood requires merely
a glance rather than physical contact.

System: The character touches the tree to be animated. The player spends a blood point and rolls normally. If the roll succeeds, the player must spend a blood
point for every success. The tree stays animated for one
turn per success rolled; once this time expires, the tree
puts its roots down wherever it stands and cannot be
animated again until the next night. While animated,
the tree follows the character’s verbal commands to
the best of its ability. An animated tree has Strength
and Stamina equal to the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating,
Dexterity 2, and a Brawl rating equal to the caster’s
own. It is immune to bashing damage, and all lethal
damage dice pools are halved due to its size.

System: Fifty pounds or twenty-five kilograms of visible wood may be gnarled for each blood point spent
on this power (the thaumaturge may expend as much
blood as she likes on this power, up to her per-turn
generational maximum). It is also possible to warp
multiple visible objects — like all the stakes a team of
vampire-hunters wields.

••• Acidic Touch
The vampire secretes a bilious, acidic fluid from any
portion of his body. The viscous acid corrodes metal,
destroys wood, and causes horrendous chemical burns
to living tissue.

Once the animating energy leaves a tree, it puts
down roots immediately, regardless of what it is currently standing on. A tree re-establishing itself in the
soil can punch through concrete and asphalt to find
nourishing dirt and water underneath, meaning that it
is entirely possible for a sycamore to root itself in the
middle of a road without any warning.

System: The player spends one blood point to create
the acid — the blood literally transmutes into the volatile secretion. One blood point creates enough acid to
burn through a quarter-inch or half a centimeter of steel
plate or three inches (seven centimeters) of wood. The
damage from an acid-augmented hand-to-hand attack
is aggravated and costs one blood point per turn to use.
A thaumaturge is immune to her own acidic touch.

Hands of Destruction

•••• Atrophy

This Path is practiced most commonly by the various
thaumaturges of the Sabbat. Though it is not widely
seen outside that Sect, a few Camarilla Tremere have

This power withers a victim’s limb, leaving only a desiccated, almost mummified husk of bone and skin. The effects
are instantaneous; in mortals, they are also irreversible.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

217

System: The victim may resist the effects of Atrophy
by scoring three or more successes on a Stamina + Athletics roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the limb is permanently and completely crippled. Partial resistance
is possible: One success indicates that the difficulty of
any roll involving the use of the arm increases by two,
though these effects are still permanent with regard to
mortals. Two successes signify that difficulties increase
by one. Vampires afflicted by this power may spend five
blood points to rejuvenate atrophied limbs. Mortals are
permanently crippled. This power affects only limbs or
parts of limbs (arms, legs, hands); it does not work on
victims’ heads, torsos, etc.

••••• Turn to Dust
This fearsome power accelerates decrepitude in its
victims. Mortals literally age at the mere touch of a
skilled thaumaturge, gaining decades in moments.
System: Each success on the roll ages the victim by
10 years. A potential victim may resist with a Stamina + Courage roll (difficulty 8), but must accumulate
more successes than the caster’s activation roll — it’s
an all-or-nothing affair. If the victim succeeds, he does
not age at all. If he does not acquire more successes
than the thaumaturge, he ages the full amount. Obviously, this power, while it affects vampires, has no detrimental effect on them (they’re immortal). At most, a
Kindred victim grows paler and withers slightly (-1 to
Appearance) for one night.

The Lure of Flames
This path grants the thaumaturge the ability to conjure forth mystical flames — small fires at first, but
skilled magicians may create great conflagrations. Fire
created by this path is not “natural.” In fact, many vampires believe the flames to be conjured from Hell itself.
The Lure of Flames is greatly feared, as fire is one of the
surest ways to bring Final Death upon a vampire. See
“Fire” (p. 297) for more information on how vampires
suffer from flame.
Fire conjured by The Lure of Flames must be released
for it to have any effect. Thus, a “palm of flame” does
not burn the vampire’s hand and cause an aggravated
wound (nor does it cause the caster to frenzy) — it
merely produces light. Once the flame has been released, however, it burns normally and the character
has no control over it.
System: The number of successes determines how
accurately the vampire places the flame in his desired
location (declared before the roll is made). One suc-

218

cess is all that is necessary to conjure a flame in one’s
hand, while five successes place a flame anywhere in
the Kindred’s line of sight. Less successes mean that
the flame appears somewhere at the Storyteller’s discretion — as a rough rule of thumb, the thaumaturge
can accurately place a flame within 10 yards or meters
of themselves per success.
Individual descriptions are not provided for each
level of this path — fire is fire, after all (including potentially causing frenzy in other vampires witnessing
it). The chart below describes the path level required
to generate a specific amount of flame. To soak the
damage at all, a vampire must have the Fortitude Discipline. Fire under the caster’s control does not harm
the vampire or cause him to frenzy, but fires started as
a result of the unnatural flame affect the thaumaturge
normally.

Neptune’s Might
Vampires are rarely associated with the ocean in
most mythologies, and most Kindred have nothing
to do with water in large quantities simply because
they have no reason to do so. Nevertheless, Neptune’s
Might has enjoyed a small, but devoted, following for
centuries among Camarilla thaumaturges. This path is
based primarily around the manipulation of standing
water, although some of its more disturbing effects depart from this principle.
Once a character reaches the third level of Neptune’s
Might, the player may choose to specialize in either
fresh water or salt water. Such specialization lowers all
Neptune’s Might difficulties by one when dealing with
the chosen medium but raises them by one when deal-

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

ing with the opposite. Blood is considered neither fresh
nor salty for this purpose, and difficulties in manipulating it are unaffected.

• Eyes of the Sea
The thaumaturge may peer into a body of water and
view events that have transpired on, in, or around it
from the water’s perspective. Some older practitioners
of this art claim that the vampire communes with the
spirits of the waters when using this power; younger
Kindred scoff at such claims.
System: The number of successes rolled determines
how far into the past the character can look.

The Storyteller may require a Perception + Occult
roll for the character to discern very small details in the
transmitted images. This power can only he used on
standing water; lakes and puddles qualify, but oceans,
rivers, sewers, and wine glasses do not.

•• Prison of Water
The thaumaturge can command a sufficiently large
quantity of water to animate itself and imprison a subject. This power requires a significant amount of fluid
to be fully effective, although even a few gallons can be
used to shape chains of animated water.
System: The number of successes scored on the roll
is the number of successes the victim must score on a
Strength roll (difficulty 8; Potence can add to this roll)
to break free. A subject may be held in only one prison
at a time, although the caster is free to invoke multiple
uses of this power upon separate victims and may dissolve these prisons at will. If a sufficient quantity of
water (at least a bathtub’s worth) is not present, the
difficulty of the Willpower roll to activate this power
is raised by one.

••• Blood to Water
The thaumaturge has now attained enough power
over water that she can transmute other liquids to this
basic element. The most commonly seen use of this
power is as an assault; with but a touch, the victim’s

blood transforms to water, weakening vampires and
killing mortals in moments.
System: The character must touch her intended victim. The player rolls Willpower normally. Each success
converts one of the victim’s blood points to water. One
success kills a mortal within minutes. Vampires who
lose blood points to this power also suffer dice pool
penalties as if they had received an equivalent number
of health levels of injury. The water left in the target’s
system by this attack evaporates out at a rate of one
blood point’s worth per hour, but the lost blood does
not return.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, other liquids may be
turned to water with this power (the difficulty for such
an action is reduced by one unless the substance is particularly dangerous or magical in nature). The character must still touch the substance or its container to use
this power.

•••• Flowing Wall
Tales of vampires’ inability to cross running water
may have derived in part from garbled accounts of this
power in action. The thaumaturge can animate water
to an even greater degree than is possible with the use
of Prison of Water, commanding it to rise up to form a
barrier impassable to almost any being.
System: The character touches the surface of a
standing body of water; the player spends three Willpower points and the normal required blood point and
rolls normally. Successes are applied to both width and
height of the wall; each success “buys” 10 feet/three
meters in one dimension. The wall may be placed anywhere within the character’s line of sight, and must be
formed in a straight line. The wall lasts until the next
sunrise. It cannot be climbed, though it can be flown
over. To pass through the barrier, any supernatural being (including beings trying to pass the wall on other
levels of existence, such as ghosts) must score at least
three successes on a single Willpower roll (difficulty
9).

••••• Dehydrate
At this level of mastery, the thaumaturge can directly attack living and unliving targets by removing the
water from their bodies. Victims killed by this power
leave behind hideous mummified corpses. This power
can also be used for less aggressive purposes, such as
drying out wet clothes — or evaporating puddles to
keep other practitioners of this path from using them.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

219

System: This power can be used on any target in the
character’s line of sight. The player rolls normally; the
victim resists with a roll of Stamina + Fortitude (difficulty 9). Each success gained by the caster translates
into one health level of lethal damage inflicted on the
victim. This injury cannot be soaked (the resistance
roll replaces soak for this attack) but can be healed
normally. Vampires lose blood points instead of health
levels, though if a vampire has no blood points this attack inflicts health level loss as it would against a mortal. The victim of this attack must also roll Courage
(difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by
the caster + 3) to be able to act on the turn following
the attack; failure means he is overcome with agony
and can do nothing.

Once a Kindred reaches a rating of 3, she may levitate herself and “fly” at approximately running speed,
no matter how much she weighs, though the weight
restrictions apply if she manipulates other objects or
subjects. Once a Kindred achieves 4, she may “throw”
objects at a Strength equal to her level of mastery of
this path.

Movement of the Mind

Invoking objects “out of thin air” has been a staple
of occult and supernatural legend since long before the
rise of the Tremere. This Thaumaturgical path enables
powerful conjurations limited only by the mind of the
practitioner.

This path gives the thaumaturge the ability to move
objects telekinetically through the mystic power of
blood. At higher levels, even flight is possible (but be
careful who sees you…). Objects under the character’s
control may be manipulated as if she held them — they
may be lifted, spun, juggled, or even “thrown,” though
creating enough force to inflict actual damage requires
mastery of at least the fourth level of this path. Some
casters skilled in this path even use it to guard their
havens, animating swords, axes, and firearms to ward
off intruders. This path may frighten and disconcert
onlookers.
System: The number of successes indicates the duration of the caster’s control over the object (or subject).
Each success allows one turn of manipulation, though
the Kindred may attempt to maintain control after
this time by making a new roll (she need not spend
additional blood to maintain control). If the roll is successful, control is maintained. If a thaumaturge loses or
relaxes control over an object and later manipulates it
again, her player must spend another blood point, as
a new attempt is being made. Five or more successes
on the initial roll means the vampire can control the
object for duration of the scene.
If this power is used to manipulate a living being, the
subject may attempt to resist. In this case, the caster
and the subject make opposed Willpower rolls each
turn the control is exercised.
Like The Lure of Flames, individual power levels are
not provided for this path — consult the chart below
to see how much weight a thaumaturge may control.

The Path of Conjuring

Objects summoned via this path bear two distinct
characteristics. They are uniformly “generic” in that
each object summoned, if summoned again, would look
exactly as it did at first. For example, a knife would be
precisely the same knife if created twice; the two would
be indistinguishable. Even a specific knife — the one a
character’s father used to threaten her — would appear
identical every time it was conjured. A rat would have
repeated “tiled” patterns over its fur, and a garbage can
would have a completely uniform fluted texture over
its surface. Additionally, conjured objects bear no
flaws: Weapons have no dents or scratches, tools have
no distinguishing marks, and cellphones all look like
they just came out of their packaging.
The limit on the size of conjured objects appears to
be that of the conjurer: nothing larger than the thaumaturge can be created. The conjurer must also have
some degree of familiarity with the object he wishes
to call forth. Simply working from a picture or imagination calls for a higher difficulty, while objects with
which the character is intimately familiar (such as the
knife described above) may actually lower the difficulty, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
When a player rolls to conjure something, the successes gained on the roll indicate the quality of the
summoned object. One success yields a shoddy, imperfect creation, while five successes garner the caster a
nearly perfect replica.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

• Summon the Simple Form
At this level of mastery, the conjurer may create
simple, inanimate objects. The object cannot have any
moving parts and may not be made of multiple materials. For example, the conjurer may summon a steel
baton, a lead pipe, a wooden stake, or a chunk of granite.
System: Each turn the conjurer wishes to keep the
object in existence, another Willpower point must be
spent or the object vanishes.

•• Permanency
At this level, the conjurer no longer needs to pay
Willpower costs to keep an object in existence. The
object is permanent, though simple objects are still all
that may be created.
System: The player must invest three blood points
in an object to make it real.

••• Magic of the Smith
The Kindred may now conjure complex objects of
multiple components and with moving parts. For example, the thaumaturge can create guns, bicycles,
chainsaws, or cellphones.
System: Objects created via Magic of the Smith are
automatically permanent and cost five blood points
to conjure. Particularly complex items often require a
Knowledge roll (Crafts, Science, Technology, etc.) in
addition to the basic roll.

•••• Reverse Conjuration
This power allows the conjurer to “banish” into nonexistence any object previously called forth via this
path.
System: This is an extended success roll. The conjurer must accumulate as many successes as the original
caster received when creating the object in question.
This can also be used by the thaumaturge to banish
object she created herself with this Path.

••••• Power Over Life
This power cannot create true life, though it can
summon forth impressive simulacra. Creatures (and
people) summoned with this power lack the free will
to act on their own, mindlessly following the simple
instructions of their conjurer instead. People created
in this way can be subject to the use of the Dominate
power Possession (p. 155), if desired.

System: The player spends 10 blood points. Imperfect and impermanent, creatures summoned via this
path are too complex to exist for long. Within a week
after their conjuration, the simulacra vanish into insubstantiality.

The Path of Corruption
The origins of this path are hotly debated among
those who are familiar with its intricacies. One theory
holds that its secrets were taught to the Tremere by demons and that use of it brings the practitioner dangerously close to the infernal powers. A second opinion
has been advanced that the Path of Corruption is a
holdover from the days when Clan Tremere was still
mortal. The third theory, and the most disturbing to
the Tremere, is that the path originated with the Followers of Set, and that knowledge of its workings was
sold to the Tremere for an unspecified price. This last
rumor is vehemently denied by the Tremere, which automatically makes it a favorite topic of discussion when
the matter comes up.
The Path of Corruption is primarily a mentally and
spiritually oriented path centered on influencing the
psyches of other individuals. It can be used neither to
issue commands like Dominate nor to change emotions in the moment like Presence. Rather, it produces
a gradual and subtle twisting of the subject’s actions,
morals, and thought processes. This path deals intimately with deception and dark desires, and those who
work through it must understand the hidden places
of the heart. Accordingly, no character may have a
higher rating in the Path of Corruption than he has in
Subterfuge.

• Contradict
The vampire can interrupt a subject’s thought processes, forcing the victim to reverse his current course
of action. An Archon may be caused to execute a prisoner she was about to exonerate and release; a mortal
lover might switch from gentle and caring to sadistic
and demanding in the middle of an encounter. The results of Contradict are never precisely known to the
thaumaturge in advance, but they always take the form
of a more negative action than the subject had originally intended to perform.
System: This power may be used on any subject
within the character’s line of sight. The player rolls as
per normal. The target rolls Perception + Subterfuge
(difficulty equal to the number of successes scored by
the caster + 2). Two successes allow the subject to real-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

221

ize that she is being influenced by some outside source.
Three successes let her pinpoint the source of the effect. Four successes give her a moment of hesitation,
neither performing her original action nor its inverse,
while five allow her to carry through with the original
action.
The Storyteller dictates what the subject’s precise
reaction to this power is. Contradict cannot be used in
combat or to affect other actions (at the Storyteller’s
discretion) that are mainly physical and reflexive.

•• Subvert
This power follows the same principle as does Contradict, the release of a subject’s dark, self-destructive
side. However, Subvert’s effects are longer-lasting than
the momentary flare of Contradiction. Under the influence of this power, victims act on their own suppressed temptations, pursuing agendas that their morals or self-control would forbid them to follow under
normal circumstances.
System: This power requires the character to make
eye contact (see p. 152) with the intended victim. The
player rolls normally. The target resists with a roll of
Perception + Subterfuge (difficulty equal to the target’s
Manipulation + Subterfuge). If the thaumaturge scores
more successes, the victim becomes inclined to follow
a repressed, shameful desire for the length of time described below.

The Storyteller determines the precise desire or
agenda that the victim follows. It should be in keeping with the Psychological Flaws that she possesses or
with the negative aspects of her Nature (for example,
a Loner desiring isolation to such an extent that she
becomes violent if forced to attend a social function).
The subject should not become fixated on following
this new agenda at all times, but should occasionally be
forced to spend a Willpower point if the opportunity to
succumb arises and she wishes to resist the impulse.

222

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

••• Dissociate
“Divide and conquer” is a maxim that is well-understood by the Tremere, and Dissociate is a powerful tool
with which to divide the Clan’s enemies. This power
is used to break the social ties of interpersonal relationships. Even the most passionate affair or the oldest
friendship can be cooled through use of Dissociate, and
weaker personal ties can be destroyed altogether.
System: The character must touch the target. The
player rolls normally. The target resists with a Willpower roll (difficulty of the thaumaturge’s Manipulation + Empathy). The victim loses three dice from
all Social rolls for a period of time determined by the
number of successes gained by the caster:
Successes
1 success

Result
Five minutes

2 successes

One hour

3 successes

One night

4 successes

Three nights

5 successes

One week

This penalty applies to all rolls that rely on Social
Attributes, even those required for the use of Disciplines. If this power is used on a character who has
participated in the Vaulderie or a similar ritual, that
character’s Vinculum ratings are reduced by three for
the duration of Dissociate’s effect.
Dissociate’s primary effect falls under roleplaying
rather than game mechanics. Victims of this power
should be played as withdrawn, suspicious, and emotionally distant. The Storyteller should feel free to require a Willpower point expenditure for a player who
does not follow these guidelines.

•••• Addiction
This power is a much stronger and more potentially
damaging form of Subvert. Addiction creates just that
in the victim. By simply exposing the target to a particular sensation, substance, or action, the caster creates a powerful psychological dependence. Many thaumaturges ensure that their victims become addicted to
substances or thrills that only the mystic can provide,
thus creating both a source of income and potential
blackmail material.
System: The subject must encounter or be exposed
to the sensation, substance, or action to which the
character wants to addict him. The thaumaturge then

touches his target. The player rolls normally; the victim resists with a Self-Control/Instinct roll (difficulty
equal to the number of successes scored by the caster
+ 3). Failure gives the subject an instant addiction to
that object.
An addicted character must get his fix at least once
a night. Every night that he goes without satisfying his
desire imposes a cumulative penalty of one die on all of
his dice pools (to a minimum pool of one die). The victim must roll Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty 8) every
time he is confronted with the object of his addiction
and wishes to keep from indulging. Addiction lasts for
a number of weeks equal to the thaumaturge’s Manipulation score.
An individual may try to break the effects of Addiction. This requires an extended Self-Control/Instinct
roll (difficulty of the caster’s Manipulation + Subterfuge), with one roll made per night. The addict must
accumulate a number of successes equal to three times
the number of successes scored by the caster. The victim may not indulge in his addiction over the time
needed to accumulate these successes. If he does so, all
accumulated successes are lost and he must begin anew
on the next night. Note that the Self-Control/Instinct
dice pool is reduced every night that the victim goes
without feeding his addiction.

••••• Dependence
Many former pawns of Clan Tremere claim to have
felt a strange sensation similar to depression when not
in the presence of their masters. This is usually attributed to the blood bond, but is sometimes the result of
the vampire’s mastery of Dependence. The final power
of the Path of Corruption enables the vampire to tie
her victim’s soul to her own, engendering feelings of
lethargy and helplessness when the victim is not in her
presence or acting to further her desires.
System: The character engages the target in conversation. The player rolls normally. The victim rolls
Self-Control/Instinct (difficulty equals the number of
successes scored by the caster + 3). Failure means that
the victim’s psyche has been subtly bonded to that of
the thaumaturge for one night per success rolled by the
caster.
A bonded victim is no less likely to attack his controller, and feels no particular positive emotions toward her. However, he is psychologically addicted to
her presence, and suffers a one-die penalty to all rolls
when he is not around her or performing tasks for her.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

223

Additionally, he is much less resistant to her commands, and his dice pools are halved when he attempts
to resist her Dominate, Presence (or other mental or
emotional control powers), or mundane Social rolls.
Finally, he is unable to regain Willpower when he is
not in the thaumaturge’s presence.

The Path of Mars
Those rare Sabbat who have retained Thaumaturgical
talents have turned their focus to the assistance of the
Sect in times of war. This path has proven useful, turning the tides of several confrontations with elder vampires. The path adopts a very martial stance, whereas
other blood magics tend to have subtler, less violent effects. It is rumored that some Camarilla Tremere have
learned this path, but very few of them have the right
temperament to wield this path effectively.

• War Cry
A vampire on the attack can focus his will, making
him less susceptible to battle fear or the powers of the
undead. The vampire shouts a primal scream to start the
effect, though some thaumaturges have been known to
paint their faces or cut themselves open instead.
System: For the duration of one scene, the vampire
adds one to his Courage Trait. Additionally, for the
purposes of hostile effects, his Willpower is considered
to be one higher (though this bonus applies only to the
Trait itself, not the Willpower pool). A character may
only gain the benefits of War Cry once per scene.

•• Strike True
The vampire makes a single attack, guided by the
unholy power of her Blood. This attack strikes its foe
infallibly.
System: By invoking this power, the player need
not roll to see if the vampire’s attack hits — it does,
automatically. Only Melee or Brawl attacks may be
made in this manner. These attacks are considered to
be one-success attacks; they offer no additional damage dice. Also, they may be dodged, blocked, or parried
normally, and the defender needs only one success (as
the attacks’ number of success is assumed to be one).
Strike True has no effect if attempted on multiple attacks (dice pool splits) in a single turn from one character.

••• Wind Dance
The thaumaturge invokes the power of the winds,
moving in a blur. She gains a preternatural edge in

224

avoiding her enemies’ blows, moving out of their way
before the enemy has a chance to throw them.
System: The player can dodge any number of attacks
with her full dice pool in a single turn. This advantage
applies only to dodges — if the character wishes to attack and dodge, the player must still split her dice pool.
This power lasts for one scene.

•••• Fearless Heart
The vampire temporarily augments his abilities as a
warrior. Through the mystical powers of blood magic,
the character becomes a potent fighting force.
System: Fearless Heart grants the vampire an extra
point in each of the Physical Attributes (Strength,
Dexterity, and Stamina). These Traits may not exceed
their generational maximums, though the player may
use blood points to push the character’s Traits even
higher. The effects last for one scene, and a character
may gain its benefits only once per scene. The vampire
must spend two hours in a calm and restful state following the use of Fearless Heart, or lose a blood point
every 15 minutes until he rests.

••••• Comrades at Arms
This ability extends the power of the previous abilities in the path. It allows any of the earlier effects to be
applied to a group such as a pack or War Party.
System: The player chooses one of the lower-level
powers in the path, invoking it as normal. Afterward,
he touches another character and (if the roll for Comrades at Arms is successful) bestows the benefit on her
as well. The same power may be delivered to any number of packmates, as long as the rolls for Comrades at
Arms are successful and the thaumaturge pays the appropriate blood costs.

The Path of Technomancy
The newest path to be accepted by the Tremere
hierarchy as part of the Clan’s official body of knowledge, the Path of Technomancy is a relatively recent
innovation, developed in the latter half of the 20th
century. The path focuses on the control of electronic
devices, from cellphones to laptops, and its proponents
maintain that it is a prime example of the versatility of
Thaumaturgy with regards to a changing world. More
conservative Tremere, however, state that mixing
Tremere magic with mortal science borders on treason
or even blasphemy, and some European Regents have
gone so far as to declare knowledge of Technomancy

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

grounds for expulsion from their chantries. The Inner
Council did approve the introduction of the path into
the Clan’s grimoires, but has yet to voice any opinion
on the conservative opposition to Technomancy.

The equipment is a total write-off;

Mortals are constantly developing new innovations,
and any vampire who would work Technomancy must
be able to understand that upon which he practices his
magic. The most basic power of this path allows the
thaumaturge to project his perceptions into a device,
granting him a temporary understanding of its purpose,
the principles of its functioning, and its means of operation. This does not grant permanent knowledge,
only a momentary flash of insight which fades within
minutes.
System: A character must touch the device in order
to apply this power. The number of successes rolled determines how well the character understands this particular piece of equipment. One success allows a basic
knowledge (on/off and simple functions), while three
successes grant competence in operating the device,
and five successes show the character the full range of
the device’s potential. The knowledge lasts for a number of minutes equal to the character’s Intelligence.
This power can also be used to understand a nonphysical technological innovation — generally a piece
of software — at +2 difficulty. The character must
touch the computer on which the software is installed
— simply holding the flash drive or CD-ROM is not
enough. Software applied remotely to a device (such
as through an app store) also cannot be analyzed until
it is installed.

•• Burnout
It is usually easier to destroy than to create, and sensitive electronics are no exception to this rule. Burnout
is used to cause a device’s power supply (either internal or external) to surge, damaging or destroying the
target. Burnout cannot be used to directly injure another individual, although the sudden destruction of
a pacemaker or a car’s fuel injection control chip can
certainly create a health hazard.
System: A character can use this power at a range
of up to 10 times her Willpower in yards or meters,
although a +1 difficulty is applied if she is not touching
the target item. The number of successes determines
the extent of the damage:

Large enough systems, such as a server cluster or
a passenger aircraft, impose a +2 to +4 difficulty (at
Storyteller discretion) to affect with this power. Additionally, some systems, such as military and banking
networks, may be protected against power surges and
spikes, and thus possess one to five dice (Storyteller
discretion again) to roll to resist this power. Each success on this roll (difficulty 6) takes away one success
from the Thaumaturgy roll.
Burnout may be used to destroy electronic data storage, in which case three successes destroy all information on the target item, and five erase it beyond any
hope of non-magical recovery.

••• Encrypt/Decrypt
Electronic security is a paramount concern of governments and corporations alike. Those thaumaturges
who are techno-savvy enough to understand the issues
at stake have become quite enamored of this power,
which allows them to scramble a device’s controls mystically, making it inaccessible to anyone else. Encrypt/
Decrypt also works on electronic media; a DVD under
the influence of this power displays just snow and static
if played back without the owner’s approval. Some neonates have taken to calling this power “DRM.”
System: The character touches the device or data
container that he wishes to encrypt. The player rolls
normally. The number of successes scored is applied as
a difficulty modifier for anyone who attempts to use the
protected equipment or access the scrambled information without the assistance of the character. The caster
can dispel the effect at any time by touching the target
item and spending a point of Willpower.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

225

This power may also be used to counter another
thaumaturge’s use of Encrypt/Decrypt. The player rolls
at +1 difficulty; each success negates one of the “owner’s.”
The effects of Encrypt/Decrypt last for a number of
weeks equal to the character’s permanent Willpower
rating.

•••• Remote Access
With this power, a skilled thaumaturge can bypass
the need for physical contact to operate a device. This
is not a form of telekinesis; the vampire does not manipulate the item’s controls, but rather touches it directly with the power of his mind.
System: This power may be used on any electronic
device within the character’s line of sight. The number of successes rolled is the maximum number of dice
from any relevant Ability that the character may use
while remotely controlling the device. (For instance, if
Fritz has Technology 5 and scores three successes while
using Remote Access on a keypad lock, he can only
apply three dots of his Technology rating to any rolls
that he makes through any use of the power.) Remote
Access lasts for a number of turns equal to the number
of successes rolled, and can only be used on one item
at a time.
If an item is destroyed while under the effects of Remote Access, the character takes five dice of bashing
damage due to the shock of having his perceptions
rudely shunted back into his own body.

••••• Telecommute
A progressive derivation of Remote Access, Telecommute allows a thaumaturge to project her consciousness into the Internet, sending her mind through
network connections as fast as they can transfer her.
While immersed in the network, she can use any other
Technomancy power on the devices with which she
makes contact.
System: The character touches any form of communications device: a cellphone, 3G-equipped netbook,
Wi-Fi tablet, or anything else that is connected directly
or indirectly to the Internet. The player rolls normally
and spends a Willpower point. Telecommute lasts for
five minutes per success rolled, and may be extended by
10 minutes with the expenditure of another Willpower
point. The number of successes indicates the maximum
range that the character can project her consciousness
away from her body:

3 successes

4 successes

5 successes

Anywhere in the world

While in the network, the character can apply any
other Path of Technomancy power to any device or
data with which she comes in contact. A loss of connection, either through the destruction of a part of the
network or simply a loss of cell signal, hurls her consciousness back to her body and inflicts eight dice of
bashing damage.
A character traveling through the Internet by means
of this power can use her Path of Technomancy powers
at a normal difficulty. Using any other abilities or powers while engaged thus is done at a +2 difficulty.

The Path of the
Father’s Vengeance
This path, based loosely on a powerful thaumaturge’s
interpretations of the Book of Nod, devotes itself to delivering justice to the race of Cainites. Each power supposedly has some precedent in the parables of the ancient book, and focuses on teaching the lessons of Caine
via the power of blood magic. Use of this path is hotly
debated in the Sabbat, as some consider it tantamount
to claiming to hold Caine’s right over all vampires oneself. Camarilla vampires don’t have the same knowledge
of the Book of Nod that the Sabbat do, but the path is
not entirely unheard of in Tremere chantries.
The power of this path comes not only from the
magic of blood, but also incantation of verses from the
Book of Nod. For any of these powers to take effect,
the caster must speak the actual condemnation. For example, to invoke the third-level power, the caster must
state plainly to his target that she may eat only ashes.
The subject must generally be able to hear the caster
for these powers to take effect, though writing them
and showing them to the subject will do.
These powers apply to vampires only. They do not affect mortals, ghouls, or any other supernatural creatures.

her husband and sire three times, thus becoming bond-

than a wretched scavenger, as he must consume literal
ashes, though he gains little sustenance from them.

System: If the subject has any blood bonds or Vinculi to other vampires, this power reveals them to the
caster. Although the caster may not know the vampires in question, this power does reveal the names and
gives rough psychic impressions of the individuals in
question.

System: The victim of this power can no longer consume blood, vomiting it up as he would mortal food or
drink. Instead, the victim can eat only ashes, and the
“blood points” he gains from this may be used only to
rise each night. Ashen “blood points” may not be used
to power Disciplines, raise Attributes, or feed ghouls
(though actual blood points in the character’s body at
the time this power is invoked may still be used for
such). One blood point’s worth of ash is roughly one
pint or half-liter, and any ash will do — cigarette ash,
campfire leftovers, or vampire corpses destroyed by fire
or sunlight. This power lasts for one week.

•• The Crone’s Pride
This power inflicts the curse of the crone, who bound
Caine to her as he fled his wife’s spurning. Hideously
ugly, the crone had to resort to trickery to get others to
help or serve her.
System: This power reduces the target’s Appearance
to zero. All Social rolls during this time generally fail,
unless the character attempts to intimidate or browbeat the subject. This power lasts for one night.

••• Feast of Ashes
Primarily used against wanton or excessive vampires,
this power temporarily removes a vampire’s dependency on blood. While some would say this negates the

Death. All but the dimmest of light causes the subject
excruciating pain, and some artificial forms of bright
light may even damage the vampire. Uriel delivered
God’s curse on Caine, shielding him in the blackness
of his wings.
System: The presence of any light makes the subject
uncomfortable, and bright light of any kind — flash-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

lights, headlights, etc. — inflict one health level of aggravated damage on the character for every turn he remains under its direct focus. Most vampires who suffer
this curse elect to sleep for the duration, hiding away in
the darkness of their havens until they can walk again
among the living without pain. This power lasts for
one week.

••••• Valediction
Many Sabbat rightfully fear this power, though very
few have ever seen it used. It levies a punishment for
breaking one of Caine’s greatest commandments —
the ban against diablerie. As most Sabbat attain their
power and station through some measure of diablerie,
they must reconcile their beliefs with the admonitions
of Caine, and this power engenders a great sense of humility.
System: When this power takes effect, the subject
immediately reverts to her original Generation. This
change may entail losing points in certain Traits due to
generational maximums. This power lasts for one week,
after which any Traits reduced to higher-Generation
maximums return to normal. It takes three turns to speak
the full verse that implements this power’s effects.

Thaumaturgical
Countermagic

Thaumaturgical Countermagic is only at full effectiveness when used against Thaumaturgy. It works with
halved dice pools against Necromancy and other mystical Disciplines, and is completely ineffective against
non-vampiric magics and powers.
Thaumaturgical Countermagic can be learned by
characters who are unable to learn Thaumaturgy (e.g.,
those with the Merit Magic Resistance). Any nonTremere character with a rating in this power automatically gains the Flaw Clan Enmity (Tremere), receiving no freebie points for it. This power cannot be taken
during character creation and cannot be spontaneously
developed. Whether the character has Thaumaturgy as
an in-Clan power or not, it costs the same as any other
non-Clan Discipline to learn.
•		
		
		
		
		
••		

This is less of a path than it is a separate Discipline,
as the power to resist Thaumaturgy can be taught independently of Thaumaturgy, even to those Kindred who
are incapable of mastering the simplest ritual. Though
the techniques of Thaumaturgical Countermagic are
not officially taught outside Clan Tremere, unofficial
methods are likely to exist. Any non-Tremere who
displays the ability to resist Thaumaturgy quickly becomes the subject of potentially fatal scrutiny from the
entirety of Clan Tremere.
System: Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treated as
a separate Discipline, although it uses the usual rules
for Thaumaturgy (including experience costs and the
fact that it is limited to only five levels). It cannot be
taken as a character’s primary path, and a rating in it
does not allow the character to perform rituals.
The use of Thaumaturgical Countermagic is treated
as a free action in combat and does not require a split
dice pool. To oppose a Thaumaturgy power or ritual, a
character must have a Thaumaturgical Countermagic
rating equal to or greater than the rating of that power

228

or ritual. The player spends a blood point and rolls the
number of dice indicated by the character’s Thaumaturgical Countermagic rating (difficulty equal to the
difficulty of the power in use). Each success cancels one
of the opposing thaumaturge’s successes.

affect him, his garments, and objects
on his person.
Four dice of countermagic.
Six dice of countermagic. The 		
character can attempt to cancel a
Thaumaturgy power that affects
anyone or anything in physical 		
contact with him.
Eight dice of countermagic.
Ten dice of countermagic. The 		
character can now attempt to cancel
a power or ritual that targets anything
within a radius equal to his 		
Willpower in yards or meters, or one
that is being used or performed within
that same radius.

Weather Control
Command over the weather has long been a staple
power of wizards both mortal and immortal, and this
path is said to predate the Tremere by millennia. The
proliferation of usage of this path outside the Clan tends
to confirm this theory; Weather Control is quite common outside the Tremere, and even outside the Cama-

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

rilla. Lower levels of this path allow subtle manipulations, while higher stages of mastery allow a vampire to
call up raging storms. The area affected by this power is
usually rather small, no more than three or four miles
(five to six kilometers) in diameter, and the changes
the power wreaks are not always immediate.
System: The number of successes rolled indicates
how long it takes the weather magic to take effect.
One success indicates an entire day may pass before the
weather changes to the thaumaturge’s liking, while a
roll with five successes brings an almost instant effect.
The difficulty of the Willpower roll necessary to invoke this power may change depending on the current
local weather conditions and the weather the character is attempting to create. The Storyteller should impose a bonus (-1 or -2 difficulty) for relatively minor
shifts, such as clearing away a light drizzle or calling
lightning when a severe thunderstorm is already raging. Conversely, a penalty (+1 or +2 difficulty) should
be applied when the desired change is at odds with the
current conditions, such as summoning the same light
drizzle in the middle of the Sahara Desert or calling
down lightning from a cloudless sky.
If the character tries to strike a specific target with
lightning, the player must roll Perception + Occult
(difficulty 6 if the target is standing in open terrain,
8 if he is under shelter, or 10 if he is inside but near a
window) in addition to the base roll to use Thaumaturgy. Otherwise the bolt goes astray, with the relative
degree of failure of the roll determining where exactly
the lightning strikes.
Effects of the power default to the maximum area
available unless the caster states that he’s attempting
to affect a smaller area. At Storyteller discretion, an
additional Willpower roll (difficulty 6) may be required
to keep the change in the weather under control.
Weather Control is not the sort of power that lends
itself well to indoor application. While certain of
the path’s uses (changes of temperature, high winds,
and possibly even fog) do make a certain amount of
sense in interior settings, others (precipitation of any
sort, lightning) don’t. The difficulty for all rolls to use
Weather Control indoors is at +2, and the Storyteller
should feel free to disallow any proposed uses that don’t
make sense.
Individual power descriptions are not provided for
this path, as the general principle is fairly consistent.

Instead, the strongest weather phenomenon possible at
each level is listed.
•		
		
		
		
		
		

Fog: Vision is slightly impaired and
sounds are muffled; a +1 difficulty is
imposed on all Perception rolls that
involve sight and hearing, and the
effective range of all ranged attacks
are halved.

		
		
		

Light breeze: A +1 difficulty is 		
imposed on all Perception rolls that
involve smell.

		
		
		
		

Minor temperature change: It is
possible to raise or lower the local
temperature by up to 10 degrees
Fahrenheit or 5 degrees Celsius.

••		
		
		
		
		
		

Rain or snow: As Fog, but 		
Perception rolls are impaired to a
much greater extent; the difficulty
modifier for all such rolls rises to +2.
In addition, the difficulty on all Drive
rolls increases by two.

•••		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		

High Winds: The wind speed 		
rises to around 30 miles per hour or
50 kilometers per hour, with gusts of
up to twice that. Ranged attacks
are much more difficult: + 1 to 		
firearm attacks and +2 to thrown
weapons and archery. In addition,
during fierce gusts, Dexterity rolls
(difficulty 6) may be required to
keep characters from being knocked
over by the winds. When gale-force
winds are in effect, papers go flying,
objects get picked up by the winds
and hurled with abandon, and other
suitably cinematic effects are likely.

		
		
		
		

Moderate temperature change: The
local temperature can be raised or
lowered by up to 20 degrees 		
Fahrenheit or 10 degrees Celsius.

Storm: This has the effects of both
Rain and High Winds.

Lightning Strike: This attack inflicts
10 dice of lethal damage. Body armor
does not add to the target’s dice pool
to soak this attack.

Rituals
Rituals are Thaumaturgical formulas, meticulously
researched and prepared, that create powerful magical
effects. Rituals are less versatile than paths, as their effects are singular and straightforward, but they are better suited to specific ends.
All thaumaturges have the ability to use rituals,
though each individual ritual must be learned separately. By acquainting herself with the arcane practice
of blood magic, the caster gains the capacity to manipulate these focused effects.
Thaumaturgical rituals are rated from 1 to 5, each
level corresponding to both the level of mastery of
Thaumaturgy the would-be caster must possess and the
relative power of the ritual itself. Unless stated otherwise, a ritual requires five minutes per level to cast.
Casting rituals requires a successful Intelligence
+ Occult roll, for which the difficulty equals 3 + the
level of the ritual (maximum 9). Only one success is
required for a ritual to work, though certain spells may
require more successes or have variable effects based
on how well the caster’s roll goes. Should a roll to activate a ritual fail, the Storyteller is encouraged to create strange occurrences or side effects, or even make it
appear that the ritual was successful, only to reveal its
failure at a later time. A botched ritual roll may even
indicate a catastrophic failure or summon an ill-tempered demon.
Rituals sometimes require special ingredients or reagents to work — these are noted in each ritual’s description. Common components include herbs, animal
bones, ceremonial items, feathers, eye of newt, tongue
of toad, etc. Acquiring magical components for a powerful ritual may form the basis for an entire story.
At the first level of Thaumaturgy, the vampire automatically gains a single Level One ritual. To learn
further rituals, the thaumaturge must find someone
to teach him, or learn the ritual from a scroll, tome,
or other archive. Learning a new ritual can take anywhere from a few nights (Level One ritual) to months
or years (Level Five ritual). Some mystics have studied
individual rituals for decades, or even centuries.

Level One Rituals
Bind the Accusing Tongue
This ancient ritual is said to have been one of the
first developed by the Tremere and a primary reason

230

for the lack of cohesive opposition to their expansion.
Bind the Accusing Tongue lays a compulsion upon
the subject that prevents him from speaking ill of the
caster, allowing the thaumaturge to commit literally
unspeakable acts without fear of reprisal.
System: The caster must have a picture or other image or effigy of the ritual’s target, a lock of the target‘s
hair, and a black silken cord. The caster winds the cord
around the hair and image while intoning the ritual’s
vocal component. Once the ritual is complete, the target must score more successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty of the caster‘s Thaumaturgy rating + 3) than the
caster scored in order to say anything negative about
the caster. The ritual lasts until the target succeeds at
this roll or the silk cord is unwound, at which point the
image and the lock of hair crumble to dust.

Blood Rush
This ritual allows the vampire to create the sensation
of drinking blood in himself without actually feeding.
The ritual can be used for pleasure, but it is more often used to prevent frenzy when confronted with fresh
blood. The vampire must carry the fang of a predatory
animal on his person for this ritual to work.
System: Performance of the ritual results in the
Beast being kept in check automatically. Blood Rush
allows the vampire to resist hunger-based frenzy for up
to one hour, at which point the Cainite feels hungry
again (assuming he did before). This ritual takes only
one turn to enact.

Communicate with Kindred Sire
By enacting this ritual, the caster may join minds
with her sire, speaking telepathically with him over
any distance. The communication may continue until
the ritual expires or until either party ends the conversation. The caster must possess an item once owned by
her sire for the ritual to work.
System: The caster must meditate for 30 minutes
to create the connection. Conversation may be maintained for 10 minutes per success on the activation
roll.

Defense of the Sacred Haven
This ritual prevents sunlight from entering an area
within 20 feet (six meters) of this ritual’s casting. A
mystical darkness blankets the area, keeping the baleful light at bay. Sunlight reflects off windows or magically fails to pass through doors or other portals. To
invoke this ritual’s protection, the caster draws sigils in

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

her own blood on all the affected windows and doors.
The ritual lasts as long as the thaumaturge stays within
the 20-foot (6-meter) radius.
System: This ritual requires one hour to perform,
during which the caster recites incantations and inscribes glyphs. One blood point is required for this
ritual to work.

Deflection of Wooden Doom
This ritual protects the caster from being staked,
whether she is resting or active. While this ritual is in
effect, the first stake that would pierce the vampire’s
heart disintegrates in the attacker’s hand. A stake
merely held near the caster is unaffected; for this ritual
to work, the stake must actively be used in an attempt
to impale the vampire.
System: The caster must surround herself with a circle of wood for a full hour. Any wood will work: furniture, sawdust, raw timber, 2’ x 4’s, whatever. The circle
must remain unbroken, however. At the end of the
hour, the vampire places a wooden splinter under her
tongue. If this splinter is removed, the ritual is nullified. This ritual lasts until the following dawn or dusk.

Devil’s Touch
Thaumaturges use this ritual to place curses upon
mortals who earn their ire. Using this ritual marks an
individual invisibly, causing all those who come in
contact with him to receive him poorly. The mortal is
treated as the most loathsome individual conceivable,
and all who deal with him do everything in their power
to make him miserable. Even bums spit at an afflicted
individual, and children taunt him and barrage him
with vulgarities.
System: The effects of this ritual last one night, disappearing as the sun rises. The mortal (it doesn’t work
on vampires) must be present when the ritual is invoked, and a penny must be placed somewhere on his
person (in a pocket, shoe, etc.).

Domino of Life
A vampire wanting or needing to simulate a human
characteristic can do so once Domino of Life is cast. For
one entire night, the vampire can eat, breathe, maintain a normal body temperature, assume a human flesh
tone, or display some other single trait of humankind
she desires. Note that only one trait can be replicated
in this fashion. The vampire must have a vial of fresh
human blood on his person to maintain this ritual.

System: Using this ritual adds one die to the caster’s
dice pools when attempting to pass as human. Unless onlookers are especially wary, the Domino of Life
should fool them into thinking the caster is mortal —
not that they should have any reason to suspect otherwise.

Engaging the Vessel of Transference
This ritual enchants a container to fill itself with
blood from any living or unliving being who holds it,
replacing the volume of blood taken with an equal
amount previously held inside the container. When
the ritual is enacted, the vessel (which must be between
the size of a small cup and a one-gallon/four-liter jug) is
sealed full of the caster’s blood and inscribed with the
Hermetic sigil which empowers the ritual. Whenever
an individual touches the container with his bare skin,
he feels a slight chill against his flesh but no further
discomfort. The container continues to exchange the
blood it contains until it is opened. The two most common uses of this ritual are to covertly create a blood
bond and to obtain a sample of a subject’s blood for
ritual or experimental purposes.
System: This ritual takes three hours to enact (reduced by 15 minutes for each success on the casting
roll) and requires one blood point (although not necessarily the caster’s blood), which is sealed inside the
container. The ritual only switches blood between itself and a subject if it is touched with bare skin — even
thin cotton gloves keep it from activating.
Individuals with at least four dots in Occult recognize the Hermetic sigil with two successes on an Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 8).

Illuminate the Trail of Prey
This ritual causes the path of the subject’s passing
to glow in a manner that only the vampire can see.
The tracks shine distinctly, but only to the eyes of the
caster. Even airplane trajectories and animal tracks
shine with unhealthy light. The ritual is nullified if the
target wades through or immerses himself in water, or
if he reaches the destination of his journey. The caster
must burn a length of white satin ribbon that has been
in her possession for at least 24 hours for this ritual to
take effect.
System: The thaumaturge must have a mental picture of or know the name of her prey. The individual’s
wake glows with a level of brightness dependent on
how long it has been since he passed that way — old
tracks burn less brightly, while fresh tracks blaze.

Incantation of the Shepherd

Widow’s Spite

This ritual enables the caster to mystically locate all
members of his herd. While intoning the ritual’s vocal
component, he spins in a slow circle with a glass object
of some sort held to each of his eyes. At the end of the
ritual, he has a subliminal sense of the direction and
distance to each of his regular vessels.

This ritual causes a pain, itch, or other significant
(but not deadly) sensation in the subject. Similar in
effect to legendary “voodoo doll” effects, this ritual is
used more out of scorn or malice than actual enmity. In
fact, it requires a wax or cloth doll that resembles the
target, which bleeds when the power takes effect.

System: This ritual gives the character the location
(relative to him) of every member of his Herd. If he
does not have the Herd Background, Incantation of the
Shepherd locates the closest three mortals from whom
the caster has fed at least three times each. This ritual
has a maximum range of 10 miles or 15 kilometers times
the character’s Herd Background, or five miles (eight
kilometers) if he has no points in that Background.

System: The ceremonial doll must resemble, however rudely, the victim of the ritual. It produces no mechanical effect, other than a simple physical stimulus.
The caster may determine where on the subject’s body
the pain or itch appears.

Purity of Flesh
The caster cleanses her body of all foreign material with this ritual. To perform it, she meditates on
bare earth or stone while surrounded by a circle of 13
sharp stones. Over the course of the ritual, the caster
is slowly purged of all physical impurities: dirt, alcohol,
drugs, poison, bullets lodged in the flesh, and tattoo
ink are equally affected, slowly rising to the surface of
the caster’s skin and flaking away as a gritty gray film
that settles within the circle. Any jewelry, makeup, or
clothes that the caster is wearing are also dissolved.
System: The player spends one blood point before
rolling. Purity of Flesh removes all physical items from
the caster’s body, but does not remove enchantments,
mind control, or diseases of the blood.

Wake with Evening’s Freshness
This ritual allows a vampire to awaken at any sign
of danger, especially during the day. If any potentially
harmful circumstances arise, the caster immediately
rises, ready to face the problem. This ritual requires the
ashes of burned feathers to be spread over the area in
which the Kindred wishes to sleep.
System: This ritual must be performed immediately
before the vampire goes to sleep for the day. Any interruption to the ceremonial casting renders the ritual ineffective. If danger arises, the caster awakens and may
ignore the Humanity/Path dice pool limit rule for the
first two turns of consciousness. Thereafter, the penalty
takes effect, but the thaumaturge will have already risen and will be able to address problematic situations.

232

Level Two Rituals
Blood Walk
A thaumaturge casts this ritual on a blood sample
from another vampire. Blood Walk is used to trace the
subject’s Kindred lineage and the blood bonds in which
the subject is involved.
System: This ritual requires three hours to cast, reduced by 15 minutes for each success on the roll. It
requires one blood point from the subject. Each success
allows the caster to “see back” one Generation (to a
limit of the Fourth Generation — the Third Generation do not give up their secrets so easily), giving the
caster both the true name of the ancestor and an image
of his face. The caster also learns the Generation and
Clan or bloodline from which the subject is descended.
With three successes, the caster also learns the identities of all parties with whom the subject shares a blood
bond, either as regnant or thrall.

Burning Blade
Developed during Clan Tremere’s troubled inception, Burning Blade allows a caster to temporarily enchant a melee weapon to inflict unhealable wounds on
supernatural creatures. While this ritual is in effect, the
weapon flickers with an unholy greenish flame.
System: This ritual can only be cast on melee weapons. The caster must cut the palm of her weapon hand
during the ritual — with the weapon if it is edged, otherwise with a sharp stone. This inflicts a single health
level of lethal damage, which cannot be soaked but
may be healed normally. The player spends three blood
points, which are absorbed by the weapon. Once the
ritual is cast, the weapon inflicts aggravated damage on
all supernatural creatures for the next few successful attacks, one per success rolled. Multiple castings of Burning Blade cannot be “stacked” for longer durations.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Furthermore, the wielder of the weapon cannot choose
to do normal damage and “save up” aggravated strikes
— each successful attack uses one aggravated strike
until there are none left, at which point the weapon
reverts to inflicting normal damage.

Donning the Mask of Shadows
This ritual renders its subject translucent; her form
appears dark and smoky, and the sounds of her footsteps are muffled. While it does not create true invisibility, the Mask of Shadows makes the subject much
less likely to be detected by sight or hearing.
System: This ritual may be simultaneously cast on a
number of subjects equal to the caster’s Occult rating;
each individual past the first adds five minutes to the
base casting time. Individuals under the Mask of Shadows can only be detected if the observer possesses a
power (such as Auspex) sufficient to penetrate Obfuscate 3. The Mask of Shadows lasts a number of hours
equal to the number of successes rolled when it is cast
or until the caster voluntarily lowers it.

Eyes of the Night Hawk
This ritual allows the vampire to see through the
eyes of a bird, and to hear through its ears. The bird

chosen must be a predatory bird, and the vampire must
touch it when initiating this ritual. At the end of this
ritual, the caster must put out the bird’s eyes, or suffer
blindness herself.
System: The vampire is able to mentally control
where the bird travels for the duration of the ritual.
The bird will not necessarily perform any other action
than flight — the caster cannot command it to fight,
pick up and return an object, or scratch a target. The
bird returns to the vampire after finishing its flight. If
the vampire does not put out the bird’s eyes, she suffers
a three-night period of blindness. This ritual ceases effect at sunrise.

Machine Blitz
Machines go haywire when this ritual is cast. It
takes effect instantly and lasts as long as the vampire
concentrates on it. This ritual may be used to kill car
engines, erase flash drives, drain the battery of a cellphone, stop life-support machines, et cetera. Essentially, Machine Blitz stops any machine more complex
than a rope-and-pulley. The thaumaturge must have a
scrap of rusted metal in her possession for this ritual to
work, though some vampires use a variant that requires
a knot steeped in human saliva to be untied.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

233

System: This ritual only stops machines; it does not
grant any control over them. The effects of this ritual
are invisible and appear to be coincidental.

Principal Focus of Vitae Infusion
This ritual imbues a quantity of blood within an
object small enough for the vampire to carry in both
hands. (The object may not be any larger than this,
though it may be as small as a dime.) After the ritual
is conducted, the object takes on a reddish hue and
becomes slick to the touch. At a mental command, the
caster may release the object from its enchantment,
causing it to break down into a pool of blood. This
blood may serve whatever purpose the vampire desires;
many thaumaturges wear enchanted baubles to ensure
they have emergency supplies of vitae.
System: An object may store only one blood point of
vitae. If a Kindred wishes to make an infused focus for
an ally, she may do so, but the blood contained within
must be her own. (If the ally then drinks the blood, he
is one step closer to the blood bond). The ally must be
present at the creation of the focus.

Recure of the Homeland
The vampire calls on the power of the earth to heal
grave wounds she may have received. The thaumaturge
must use at least a handful of dirt from the city or town
of her mortal birth and recite a litany of her mortal
family tree as she casts this ritual.
System: The Cainite must mix the earth with two
points of her own blood to make a healing paste. One
handful will heal one aggravated wound, and only one
handful can be used per night. This ritual can only be
used on the vampire who knows it.

Ward Versus Ghouls
Wary Tremere created this ritual to protect themselves from the minions of vengeful rivals. By invoking
this ritual, the caster creates a glyph that causes great
pain to any ghouls who come in contact with it. The
Kindred pours a point’s worth of blood over the object he wishes to ward (a piece of parchment, a coin,
a doorknob, etc.), and recites the incantation, which
takes 10 minutes. In 10 hours, the magical ward is complete, and will inflict excruciating pain on any ghoul
unfortunate enough to touch the warded object.
System: Ghouls who touch warded objects suffer
three dice of lethal damage. This damage occurs again
if the ghoul touches the object further; indeed, a ghoul
who consciously wishes to touch a warded object must
spend a point of Willpower to do so.

234

This ritual wards only one object — if inscribed on
the side of a car, the ward affects only that door or
fender, not the whole car. Wards may be placed on
weapons, even bullets, though this usually works best
on small-caliber weapons. Bullets often warp upon firing, however, and for a ward to remain intact on a fired
round, the player needs five successes on the Firearms
roll.

Warding Circle versus Ghouls
This ritual is enacted in a manner similar to that of
Ward versus Ghouls, but creates a circle centered on
the caster into which a ghoul cannot pass without being burned. The circle can be made as large and as permanent as the caster desires, as long as she is willing to
pay the necessary price. Many Tremere chantries and
havens are protected by this and other Warding Circle
rituals.
System: The ritual requires three blood points of
mortal blood. The caster determines the size of the
warding circle when it is cast; the default radius is 10
feet/3 meters, and every 10-foot/3-meter increase raises
the difficulty by one, to a maximum of 9 (one additional success is required for every increase past the number
necessary to raise the difficulty to 9). The player spends
one blood point for every 10 feet/3 meters of radius and
rolls. The ritual takes the normal casting time if it is to
be short-term (lasting for the rest of the night) or one
night if it is to be long-term (lasting a year and a day).
Once the warding circle is established, any ghoul
who attempts to cross its boundary feels a tingle on his

Other Warding Circle Rituals
The Tremere have access to several other
Warding Circle rituals: Warding Circle versus
Lupines (Level Three), Warding Circle versus
Kindred (Level Four), and Warding Circles
versus Spirits, Ghosts, and Demons (Level
Five). Each Warding Circle ritual must be
learned separately. The material components
required for each warding circle are the same
as those needed for the corresponding ward,
but in larger amounts. The effects against the
targeted beings are the same as for Warding
Circle versus Ghouls.

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

skin and a slight breeze on his face — a successful Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 8) identifies this as
a warding circle. If the ghoul attempts to press on, he
must roll more successes on a Willpower roll (difficulty
of the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating + 3) than the caster
rolled when establishing the ward. Failure indicates
that the ward blocks his passage and inflicts three dice
of bashing damage, and his next roll to attempt to enter the circle is at +1 difficulty. If the ghoul leaves the
circle and attempts to enter it again, he must repeat
the roll. Attempts to leave the circle are not blocked.

Level Three Rituals
Clinging of the Insect
This ritual allows the caster to cling to walls or ceilings, as would a spider. She may even crawl along these
surfaces (as long as they can support her). Use of this
power seriously discomfits mortal onlookers. The character must place a live spider under her tongue for the
duration of the ritual (though the spider may die while
in the thaumaturge’s mouth without canceling the
power).
System: The character may move at half her normal rate while climbing walls or ceilings. This power
lasts for one scene, or until the vampire spits out the
spider.

Flesh of Fiery Touch
This defensive ritual inflicts painful burns on anyone
who deliberately touches the subject’s skin. It requires
the subject to swallow a small glowing ember, which
does put off some vampires with low pain thresholds.
Some vain thaumaturges use this ritual purely for its
subsidiary effect of darkening the subject’s skin to a
healthy sun-bronzed hue.
System: Flesh of Fiery Touch takes two hours to cast
(reduced by 10 minutes per success). It requires a small
piece of wood, coal, or other common fuel source,
which ignites and is swallowed at the end of the ritual.
The subject who swallows the red-hot ember receives
a single aggravated health level of damage (difficulty 6
to soak with Fortitude). Until the next sunset, anyone
who touches the subject’s flesh receives a burn that inflicts a single aggravated health level of damage (again,
difficulty 6 to soak with Fortitude). The victim must
voluntarily touch the subject; this damage is not inflicted if the victim is touched or accidentally comes in
contact with the subject.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

235

This ritual darkens the subject’s skin to that which
would be obtained by long-term exposure to the sun in
a mortal. The tone is slightly unnatural and metallic,
and is clearly artificial to any observer who succeeds in
a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty 8).

Incorporeal Passage
Use of this ritual allows the thaumaturge to make
herself insubstantial. The caster becomes completely
immaterial and thus is able to walk through walls, pass
through closed doors, escape manacles, etc. The caster
also becomes invulnerable to physical attacks for the
duration of the ritual. The caster must follow a straight
path through any physical objects, and may not draw
back. Thus, a Kindred may walk through a solid wall,
but may not walk down through the earth (as it would
be impossible to reach the other side before the ritual
lapsed). This ritual requires that the caster carry a shard
from a shattered mirror to hold her image.
System: This ritual lasts a number of hours equal to
the number of successes scored on a Wits + Survival
roll (difficulty 6). The caster may prematurely end the
ritual (and, thus, her incorporeality) by turning the
mirror shard away so that it no longer reflects her image.

Mirror of Second Sight
This object is an oval mirror no less than four inches
(10 cm) wide and no more than 18 inches (45 cm) in
length. It looks like a normal mirror, but once created,
the vampire can use it to see the supernatural: It reflects the true form of Lupines and faeries, and enables
the owner to see ghosts as they move though the Underworld. The caster creates the mirror by bathing an
ordinary mirror in a quantity of her own blood while
reciting a ritual incantation.
System: The ritual requires one point of the vampire’s blood. Thereafter, the mirror reflects images of
other supernatural creatures’ true forms — werewolves
appear in their hulking man-wolf shapes, magi glow in
a scintillating nimbus, ghosts become visible (in the
mirror), and so on. Sometimes, the mirror also reveals
those possessed of True Faith in clouds of golden light.

Pavis of Foul Presence
The Tremere joke privately that this is their “ritual
for the Ventrue.” Kindred who invoke the Presence
Discipline on the subject of this ritual find the effects of
their Discipline reversed, as if they had used the power
on themselves. For example, a vampire using Presence
to instill fear in a Kindred under the influence of this

236

ritual feels the fear herself; a vampire summoning the
caster is instead drawn to the thaumaturge’s location.
This ritual is an unbroken secret among the Tremere,
and the Warlocks maintain that its use is unknown
outside their Clan. The magical component for this
ritual is a length of blue silken cord, which must be
worn around the caster’s neck.
System: This ritual lasts against a number of effects
equal to the successes rolled, or until the sunrise after it is enacted. Note that the Presence Discipline
power must actually succeed before being reversed by
the ritual. As such, only powers that specifically target
the caster (and thus, require a roll to succeed) can be
reversed — “passive” powers such as Majesty are not
affected.

Sanguine Assistant
Thaumaturges often need laboratory assistants whom
they can trust implicitly. This ritual allows the intrepid
vampire to conjure a temporary servant. To cast the
ritual, the thaumaturge slices open his arm and bleeds
into a specially prepared earthen bowl. The ritual sucks
in and animates whatever random unimportant items
the wizard happens to have lying around his workshop
— glass beakers, dissection tools, pencils, crumpled papers, semiprecious stones — and binds the materials
together into a small humanoid form animated by the
power of the ritual and the blood. Oddly enough, this
ritual almost never takes in any tool that the caster
finds himself needing during the assistant’s lifespan,
nor does it take the physical components of any other
ritual nor any living thing. The servant has no personality to speak of at first, but gradually adopts the
mannerisms and thought processes that the thaumaturge desires in an ideal servant. Sanguine Assistants
are temporary creations, but some vampires become
fond of their tiny accomplices and create the same one
whenever the need arises.
System: The player spends five blood points and
rolls. The servant created by the ritual stands a foot
(30 cm) high and appears as a roughly humanoid shape
composed of whatever the ritual sucked in for its own
use. It lasts for one night per success rolled. At the end
of the last night, the assistant crawls into the bowl used
for its creation and falls apart. The assistant can be reanimated through another application of this ritual; if

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

of the caster. It begins with no Social Attributes to
speak of, but gains one dot per night in Charisma and
Manipulation until its ratings are equal to those of the
caster. It has all of the caster’s Abilities at one dot lower than his own. A Sanguine Assistant is a naturally
timid creature and flees if attacked, though it will try to
defend its master’s life at the cost of its own. It has no
Disciplines of its own, but has a full understanding of
all of its master’s Thaumaturgical knowledge and can
instruct others if so commanded. A Sanguine Assistant
is impervious to any mind-controlling Disciplines or
magic, so completely is it bound to its creator’s will.

Shaft of Belated Quiescence
This ritual turns an ordinary stake of rowan wood
into a particularly vicious weapon. When the stake
penetrates a vampire’s body, the tip breaks off and begins working its way through the victim’s flesh to his
heart. The trip may take several minutes or several
nights, depending on where the stake struck. The stake
eludes attempts to dig it out, burrowing farther into the
victim’s body to escape surgery. The only Kindred who
are immune to this internal attack are those who have
had their hearts removed by Serpentis.
System: The ritual takes five hours to enact, minus
30 minutes per success. The stake must be carved of
rowan wood, coated with three blood points of the
caster’s blood, and blackened in an oak-wood fire.
When the ritual is complete, the stake is enchanted to
act as described above.
An attack with a Shaft of Belated Quiescence is performed as with a normal stake: a Dexterity + Melee
roll (difficulty 6, modified as per the normal combat
rules; the attack does not need to specifically target the
heart) with a lethal damage rating of Strength + 1. If
at least one health level of damage is inflicted after the
target rolls to soak, the tip of the stake breaks off and
begins burrowing. If not, the stake may be used to make
subsequent attacks until it strikes deep enough to activate.
Once the tip of the stake is in the victim’s body, the
Storyteller begins an extended roll of the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating (difficulty 9), rolling once per hour of
game time. Successes on this roll are added to the successes scored in the initial attack. This represents the
tip’s progress toward the victim’s heart. A botch indicates that the tip has struck a bone and all accumulated
successes are lost (including those from the initial attack roll). Removing the part of the body where the tip
impacted (such as a Tzimisce turning into blood or a

vampire cutting off their arm) may stop the tip’s progress, depending on the number of successes acquired
and the Storyteller’s discretion. When the shaft accumulates a total of 15 successes, it reaches the victim’s
heart. This paralyzes Kindred and is instantly fatal to
mortals and ghouls.
Attempts to surgically remove the tip of the shaft
can be made with an extended Dexterity + Medicine
roll made once per hour (difficulty 7 for Kindred and 8
for mortals). The surgeon must accumulate a number
of successes equal to those currently held by the shaft
in order to remove the tip. Once surgery begins, however, the shaft begins actively evading the surgeon’s
probes, and its rolls are made once every 30 minutes for
the duration of the surgery attempt. Each individual
surgery roll that scores less than three successes inflicts
an additional unsoakable level of lethal damage on the
patient.
Shaft of Belated Quiescence may be performed on
other wooden impaling weapons, such as spears, arrows, practice swords, and pool cues, provided that
they are made of rowan wood. It may not, however,
create a Bullet of Belated Quiescence.

Ward versus Lupines
This wards an object in a manner identical to that of
the Level Two ritual Ward Versus Ghouls, except that
it affects werewolves.
System: Ward versus Lupines behaves exactly as does
Ward versus Ghouls, but it affects werewolves rather
than ghouls. The ritual requires a handful of silver dust
rather than a blood point.

Level Four Rituals
Bone of Lies
This ritual enchants a mortal bone so that anyone
who holds it must tell the truth. The bone in question
is often a skull, though any part of the skeleton will
do — some casters use strings of teeth, necklaces of
finger joints, or wands fashioned from ribs or arms. The
bone grows blacker as it compels its holder to tell the
truth, until it has turned completely ebony and has no
magic left.
This ritual binds the spirit of the individual to whom
the bone belonged in life; it is this spirit who wrests
the truth from the potential liar. The spirit absorbs
the lies intended to be told by the bone’s holder, and
as it compels more truth, it becomes more and more
corrupt. If summoned forth, this spirit reflects the sins

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

237

it has siphoned from the defeated liar (in addition to
anger over its unwilling servitude). For this reason,
anonymous bones are often used in the ritual, and the
bone is commonly buried after it has been used to its
full extent. A specific bone may never be used twice
for this ritual, though different bones from the same
corpse can.
System: The bone imbued with this magical power
must be at least 200 years old and must absorb 10 blood
points on the night that the ritual is cast. Each lie
the holder wishes to tell consumes one of these blood
points, and the holder must speak the truth immediately thereafter. When all 10 blood points have been
consumed, the bone’s magic ceases to work.

Firewalker
This ritual imbues the vampire with an unnatural resistance to fire. Only a foolish vampire would actually
attempt to walk on or through fire, but this ritual does
grant an advanced tolerance to flame. Some Sabbat use
this ritual to show off, while other thaumaturges use
it only for martial concerns. To enact the ritual, the
caster must cut off the end of one of his fingers and
burn it in a Thaumaturgical circle.
System: Cutting off one’s finger does not do any
health levels of damage, but it hurts like hell and requires a Willpower roll to perform. This ritual may be
cast on other vampires (at the expense of the caster’s
fingertips...). If the subject has no Fortitude, he may
soak fire with his Stamina for the duration of this ritual. If the vampire has Fortitude, he may soak fire with
his Stamina + Fortitude for the duration of the ritual.
This ritual lasts one hour.

Heart of Stone
A vampire under the effect of this ritual experiences
the transformation suggested by the ritual’s name: his
heart is completely transmuted to solid rock, rendering him virtually impervious to staking. The subsidiary
effects of the transformation, however, seem to follow
the Hermetic laws of sympathetic magic: The vampire’s emotional capacity becomes almost nonexistent,
and his ability to relate to others suffers as well.
System: This ritual requires nine hours (reduced by
one hour for every success). It can only be cast on oneself. The caster lies naked on a flat stone surface and
places a bare candle over his heart. The candle burns
down to nothing over the course of the ritual, causing
one aggravated health level of damage (difficulty 5 to
soak with Fortitude).

238

At the end of the ritual, the caster’s heart hardens
to stone. The caster gains a number of additional dice
equal to twice his Thaumaturgy rating to soak any attack that aims for his heart and is completely impervious to the effects of a Shaft of Belated Quiescence (see
p. 237). Additionally, the difficulty to use all Presence
or other emotionally manipulative powers on him is
increased by three due to his emotional isolation. The
drawbacks are as follows: the caster’s Conscience/Conviction and Empathy scores drop to 1 (or to 0 if they
already were at 1) and all dice pools for Social rolls except those involving Intimidation are halved (including those required to use Disciplines). All Merits that
the character has pertaining to positive social interaction are neutralized. Heart of Stone lasts as long as the
caster wishes it to.

Splinter Servant
Another ritual designed to enchant a stake, Splinter
Servant is a progressive development of Shaft of Belated Quiescence. (The two rituals, however, are mutually exclusive.) A Splinter Servant consists of a stake
carved from a tree which has nourished itself on the
dead. The stake must be bound in wax-sealed nightshade twine. When the binding is torn off, the Splinter Servant leaps to life, animating itself and attacking
whomever the wielder commands — or the wielder, if
she is too slow in assigning a target. The servant splits
itself into a roughly humanoid form and begins singlemindedly trying to impale the target’s heart. Its exertions tear it apart within a few minutes, but if it pierces
its victim’s heart before it destroys itself, it is remarkably difficult to remove, as pieces tend to remain behind if the main portion is yanked out.
System: The ritual requires 12 hours to cast, minus one per success, and the servant must be created
as described above. When the binding is torn off, the
character who holds it must point the servant at its
target and verbally command it to attack during the
same turn. If this command is not given, the servant
attacks the closest living or unliving being, usually the
unfortunate individual who currently carries it.
A Splinter Servant always aims for the heart. It has
an attack dice pool of the caster’s Wits + Occult, a
damage dice pool of the caster’s Thaumaturgy rating,
and a maximum movement rate of 30 yards or meters
per turn. Note that these values are those of the caster
who created the servant, not the individual who activates it. A Splinter Servant cannot fly, but can leap
its full movement rating every turn. Every action it
takes is to attack or move toward its target; it cannot

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

dodge or split its dice pool to perform multiple attacks.
The servant makes normal stake attacks that aim for
the heart (difficulty 9), and its success is judged as per
the rules for a normal staking (see p. 280). A Splinter
Servant has three health levels, and attacks directed
against it are made at +3 difficulty due to its small size
and erratic movement patterns.
A Splinter Servant has an effective life of five combat turns per success rolled in its creation. If it has not
impaled its victim by the last turn of its life, the servant
collapses into a pile of ordinary, inanimate splinters.
Three successes on a Dexterity roll (difficulty 8) are
required to remove a Splinter Servant from a victim’s
heart without leaving behind shards of the stake.

Ward versus Kindred
This warding ritual functions exactly as do Ward
versus Ghouls and Ward versus Lupines, but it inflicts
injury upon Cainites.
System: Ward versus Kindred behaves exactly as
does Ward versus Ghouls, but it affects vampires rather
than ghouls. The ritual requires a blood point of the
caster’s own blood and does not affect the caster.

Level Five Rituals
Blood Contract
This ritual creates an unbreakable agreement between the two parties who sign it. The contract must
be written in the caster’s blood and signed in the blood
of whoever applies their name to the document. This
ritual takes three nights to enact fully, after which both
parties are compelled to fulfill the terms of the contract.
System: This ritual is best handled by the Storyteller, who may bring those who sign the blood contract
into compliance by whatever means necessary (it is
not unknown for demons to materialize and enforce
adherence to certain blood contracts). The only way
to terminate the ritual is to complete the terms of the
contract or to burn the document itself — attempts to
add a clause forbidding burning the contract have resulted in the contract spontaneously combusting upon
completion of the ritual. One blood point is consumed
in the creation of the document, and an additional
blood point is consumed by those who sign it.

Enchant Talisman
This ritual is the first taught to most Tremere once
they have attained mastery of their first path. Create

Talisman allows the caster to enchant a personal magical item (the fabled wizard’s staff) to act as an amplifier
for her will and thaumaturgical might. Many talismans
are laden with additional rituals (such as every ward
known to the caster). The physical appearance of a
talisman varies, but it must be a rigid object close to
a yard or a meter long. Swords and walking sticks are
the most common talismans, but some innovative or
eccentric thaumaturges have enchanted violins, shotguns, pool cues, and classroom pointers.
System: This ritual requires six hours per night for
one complete cycle of the moon, beginning and ending
on the new moon. Over this time, the vampire carefully prepares her talisman, carving it with Hermetic
runes that signify her true name and the sum total of
her thaumaturgical knowledge. The player spends one
blood point per night and makes an extended roll of
Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 8), one roll per week.
If a night’s work is missed or if the four rolls do not
accumulate at least 20 net successes, the talisman is
ruined and the process must be begun again.
A completed talisman gives the caster several advantages. When the character is holding the talisman, the
difficulty of all magic that targets her is increased by
one. The player receives two extra dice when rolling
for uses of the character’s primary path and one extra
die when rolling for the character’s ritual castings. If
the talisman is used as a weapon, it gives the player
an additional die to roll to hit. If the thaumaturge is
separated from her talisman, a successful Perception +
Occult roll (difficulty 7) gives her its location.
If a talisman is in the possession of another individual, it gives that individual three additional dice to roll
when using any form of magic against the talisman’s
owner. At the Storyteller’s discretion, rituals that target the caster and use her talisman as a physical component may have greatly increased effects.
A thaumaturge may only have one talisman at a
time. Ownership of a talisman may not be transferred
— each individual must create her own.

Escape to a True Friend
Escape to a True Friend allows the caster to travel to
the person whose friendship and trust she most values.
The ritual has a physical component of a yard-wide/
meter-wide circle charred into the bare ground or
floor. The caster may step into the circle at any time
and speak the true name of her friend. She is instantly
transported to that individual, wherever he may be at
the moment. She does not appear directly in front of

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

239

him, but materializes in a location within a few minutes’ walk that is out of sight of any observer. The circle
may be reused indefinitely, as long as it is unmarred.
System: This ritual takes six hours a night for six
nights to cast, reduced by one night for every two successes. Each night requires the sacrifice of three of the
caster’s own blood points, which are poured into the
circle. Once the circle is complete, the transport may
be attempted at any time. The caster may take one
other individual with her when she travels, or a maximum amount of “cargo” equal to her own weight.

Paper Flesh
This dreadful ritual enfeebles the subject, making
her skin brittle and weak. Humors rise to the surface
and flesh tightens around bones and scales away at the
slightest touch. Used against physically tough opponents, this ritual strips away the inherent resilience of
the vampiric body, leaving it a fragile, dry husk. The
thaumaturge must inscribe his subject’s true name
(which is much harder to discern for elders than it is
for young vampires) on a piece of paper, which he uses
to cut himself and then burns to cinders.
System: This ritual causes the subject’s Stamina and
Fortitude (if any) to drop to 1 each. For every Generation below Eighth, the subject retains one extra point
of Stamina or Fortitude (keeping Fortitude first, though
she may not exceed her original scores). For example, a
vampire of the Fourth Generation with Fortitude targeted by Paper Flesh would drop to a Stamina + Fortitude score of 6 (assuming the score was 6 or more to
begin with). This ritual lasts one night.

Ward versus Spirits
This warding ritual functions exactly as Ward versus
Ghouls, but it inflicts injury upon spirits. Several other
versions of this ward exist, each geared toward a particular type of non-physical being.
System: Ward versus Spirits behaves exactly as does
Ward versus Ghouls, but it affects spirits (including those
summoned or given physical form by Thaumaturgy Paths
such as Elemental Mastery). The material component
for Ward versus Spirits is a handful of pure sea salt.
The other versions of this ward, also Level Five rituals, are Ward versus Ghosts and Ward versus Demons.
Each of these three Level Five wards affects its respective target on both the physical and spiritual planes.
Ward versus Ghosts requires a handful of powdered
marble from a tombstone, while Ward versus Demons
requires a vial of holy water.

240

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Vicissitude
Vicissitude is the signature power of the Tzimisce,
and is rarely shared outside the Clan (though it is
known to some other Cainites of the Sabbat). Similar
to Protean in some ways, Vicissitude allows vampires
to shape and sculpt flesh and bone. When a Kindred
uses Vicissitude to alter mortals, ghouls, and vampires
of higher Generation, the effects of the power are permanent; vampires of equal or lower Generation can
choose to heal the effects of Vicissitude as though they
were aggravated wounds. A wielder of Vicissitude can
always reshape her own flesh.
The wielder must establish skin-to-skin contact and
must often manually sculpt the desired result for these
powers to take effect. This also applies to the use of the
power on oneself. Tzimisce skilled in Vicissitude are
often inhumanly beautiful; those less skilled are simply
inhuman.
There are rumors that Vicissitude is a disease rather
than a “normal” Discipline, but only the Fiends know
for sure, and they aren’t talking.
Note: Nosferatu always “heal” Vicissitude alterations, at least the ones that make them better-looking.
The ancient curse of the Clan may not be circumvented through Vicissitude. The same applies to physical
deformities from the Gangrel Clan weakness.

Body Crafts
Vampires who wish to use Vicissitude well
often specialize their knowledge of Medicine
in an art known as Body Crafts. This specialization enables its possessor to make all
manner of alterations to living and dead flesh
and bone. It also gives insight into more mundane techniques; many Tzimisce are skilled at
flaying, bone-carving, embalming, taxidermy,
tattooing, and piercing.

• Malleable Visage
A vampire with this power may alter her own bodily
parameters: height, build, voice, facial features, and
skin tone, among other things. Such changes are cos-

metic and minor in scope — no more than a foot (30
cm) of height gained or lost, for example. She must
physically mold the alteration, literally shaping her
flesh into the desired result.
System: The player must spend a blood point for
each body part to be changed, then roll Intelligence +
Medicine (difficulty 6). To duplicate another person or
voice requires a Perception + Medicine roll (difficulty
8), and five successes are required for a flawless copy;
fewer successes leave minute (or not-so-minute) flaws.
Increasing one’s Appearance Trait has a difficulty of 9,
and the vampire must spend an additional blood point
for each dot of Appearance increased beyond their natural total. A botch permanently reduces the Attribute
by one.

•• Fleshcraft
This power is similar to Malleable Visage, above, but
allows the vampire to perform drastic, grotesque alterations on other creatures. Tzimisce often use this power
to transform their servitors into monstrous guards, the
better to frighten foes. Only flesh (skin, muscle, fat,
and cartilage, but not bone) may be transformed.
System: After spending a blood point, the vampire must grapple the intended victim. The player of
the Flescrafting vampire makes a successful Dexterity + Medicine roll (difficulty variable: 5 for a crude
yank-and-tuck, up to 9 for precise transformations). A
vampire who wishes to increase another’s Appearance
Trait does so as described under Malleable Visage; reducing the Attribute is considerably easier (difficulty
5), though truly inspired disfigurement may dictate a
higher difficulty. In either case, each success increases
or reduces the Attribute by one.
A vampire may use this power to move clumps of
skin, fat, and muscle tissue, thus providing additional
padding where needed. For each success scored on a
Dexterity + Medicine roll (difficulty 8), the vampire
may increase the subject’s soak dice pool by one, at the
expense of either a point of Strength or a health level
(vampire’s choice).

••• Bonecraft
This terrible power allows a vampire to manipulate
bone in the same manner that flesh is shaped. In conjunction with Fleshcraft, above, this power enables a
Vicissitude practitioner to deform a victim (or herself)
beyond recognition. This power should be used in conjunction with the flesh-shaping arts, unless the vampire wants to inflict injury on the victim (see below).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

241

System: The vampire’s player must spend a blood
point and make a Strength + Medicine roll (difficulties
as above). Bonecraft may be used without the fleshshaping arts, as an offensive weapon. Each success
scored on the Strength + Medicine roll (difficulty 7)
inflicts one health level of lethal damage on the victim, as his bones rip, puncture, and slice their way out
of his skin.
The vampire may utilize this power (on herself or
others) to form spikes or talons of bone, either on the
knuckles as an offensive weapon or all over the body
as defensive “quills.” If bone spikes are used, the vampire or victim takes one health level of lethal damage
(the vampire’s comes from having the very sharp bone
pierce through his skin — this weaponry doesn’t come
cheaply). In the case of quills, the subject takes a number of health levels equal to five minus the number of
successes (a botch kills the subject or sends the vampire
into torpor). These health levels may be healed normally. Knuckle spikes inflict Strength +1 lethal damage. Defensive quills inflict a hand-to-hand attacker’s
Strength in lethal damage unless the attacker scores
three or more successes on the attack roll (in which
case the attacker takes no damage); the defender still
takes damage normally. Quills also enable the vampire
or altered subject to add two to all damage inflicted via
holds, clinches, or tackles.
A vampire who scores five or more successes on the
Strength + Medicine roll may cause a rival vampire’s
rib cage to curve inward and pierce the heart. While
this does not send a vampire into torpor, it does cause
the affected vampire to lose half his blood points, as
the seat of his vitae ruptures in a shower of gore.

•••• Horrid Form
Kindred use this power to become hideous and deadly monsters. The vampire’s stature increases to a full
eight feet (two and a half meters), the skin becomes a
sickly greenish-gray or grayish-black chitin, the arms
become apelike and ropy with ragged black nails, and
the face warps into something out of a nightmare. A
row of spines sprouts from the vertebrae, and the external carapace exudes a foul-smelling grease.
System: The Horrid Form costs two blood points to
awaken. All Physical Attributes increase by three, but
all Social Attributes drop to zero, except when dealing
with others also in Horrid Form. However, a vampire
in Horrid Form who is trying to intimidate someone
may substitute Strength for a Social Attribute. Damage inflicted in brawling combat increases by one due

242

to the jagged ridges and bony knobs creasing the creature’s hands.

••••• Bloodform
A vampire with this power can physically transform
all or part of her body into sentient vitae. This blood
is in all respects identical to the vampire’s normal vitae; she can use it to nourish herself or others, create
ghouls, or establish blood bonds. If all this blood is imbibed or otherwise destroyed, the vampire meets Final
Death.
System: The vampire may transform all or part of
herself as she deems fit. Each leg can turn into two
blood points worth of vitae, as can the torso; each arm,
the head, and the abdomen convert to one blood point
each. The blood can be reconverted to the body part,
provided it is in contact with the vampire. If the blood
has been utilized or destroyed, the vampire must spend
a number of blood points equal to what was originally
created to regrow the missing body part.
A vampire entirely in this form may not be staked,
cut, bludgeoned, or pierced, but can be burned or exposed to the sun. The vampire may ooze along, drip up
walls, and flow through the narrowest cracks, as though
she were in Tenebrous Form (p. 190).
Mental Disciplines may be used, provided no eye
contact or vocal utterance is necessary, although the
vampire can perceive her surroundings just fine (but
the perceptions are always centered on the largest pool
of blood). If a vampire in this form “washes” over a
mortal or animal, that mortal must make a Courage
roll (difficulty 8) or fly into a panic.

••••• • Chiropteran Marauder
Similar to Horrid Form, the Chiropteran Marauder
is a terrifying, bipedal bat, bearing a wickedly fanged
maw and veined, leathery wings. This power confers all
of the benefits of the Horrid Form, in addition to a few
others. The mere sight of the marauder is enough to
make mortals or weak-willed vampires flee in horror.
System: The vampire gains all the effects of the Horrid Form. Further, the Marauder’s fluted wings allow
flight at 25 mph (40 kph), during which the vampire
may carry, but not manipulate, objects no larger than
it can hold in its hands. If the player chooses to, she
may make a Strength + Medicine roll (difficulty 6) to
extend bony claws at the ends of the vampire’s wings.
These claws inflict Strength +2 aggravated damage.
Also, the vampire subtracts two from all hearing-based
Perception rolls (though he adds one to vision- based

CHAPTER FOUR: DISCIPLINES

Wits and Perception rolls). Assuming the mantle of
the Chiropteran Marauder costs three blood points.

••••• • Blood of Acid
At this level of mastery, the vampire has converted
his blood to a viscous acid. Any blood he consumes
likewise becomes acid, which is corrosive enough to
burn human (and vampiric flesh) as well as wood. This
effect is particularly potent when the vampire assumes
the Bloodform. One of the side effects of this power
is the complete inability to create new vampires and
ghouls, or give blood to another vampire — the acid
would corrode them as they drank it. The obvious benefit, however, is that would-be diablerists are likewise
unable to devour the Cainite’s blood.
System: Each acidified blood point that comes in
contact with something other than the vampire himself does five dice worth of aggravated damage. If the
vampire is injured in combat, his blood may spatter on
an opponent — foes must make Dexterity + Athletics
rolls to avoid the blood, which must be accomplished by
splitting their dice pools. (Unless an opponent knows
the vampire has this power, she’s unlikely to split her
dice pool on her first attack, which causes many Tzimisce to cackle with glee.)

••••• •• Cocoon
The Cainite can form an opaque cocoon from blood
and other fluids excreted from her body. The cocoon
hardens after a few moments, turning into a tough,
white shell. This cocoon provides considerable protection to the vampire, even shielding her from sunlight
and, to a limited degree, fire.
System: A vampire may only cocoon herself, and the
process takes 10 minutes. Additionally, creating a cocoon costs three blood points. The cocoon offers complete protection from sunlight, and provides a number
of dice of soak equal to twice the vampire’s unmodified
Stamina against all damage, aggravated or otherwise.

It lasts as long as the Cainite wishes, and she may dissolve it at her whim, emerging from a pulpy, bloody
paste. A vampire contained within a cocoon may still
use mental Disciplines that do not require eye contact
or other conditions to be met.

••••• ••• Breath of the Dragon
The vampire becomes like one of the terrible draculs
of the Old World, able to exhale a deadly gout of flame.
This flame does not hurt the vampire himself, though
he may become trapped in flames if it engulfs flammable objects.
System: The flaming cloud affects a six-foot area, doing two dice of aggravated damage to anyone in the
flames’ circumference. This fire may cause combustible
items to ignite, and it may ignite victims who suffer fire
damage as per the fire rules on page 297.

••••• •••• Earth’s Vast Haven
This power, developed in the nights when the Tzimisce were the terrible masters of Eastern Europe,
allows the vampire to sink into and disperse himself
through the ground. Unlike the Protean power of Earth
Meld, however, the vampire actually dissolves his body
into the ground; nothing short of a wide-area explosion can affect him, and he may not be dug up bodily.
In addition, from sunset to sunrise, the vampire may
see and hear everything happening in his environment
through his mystical connection to the land. The mere
fact that this power exists terrifies many Tzimisce, who
are secretly unsure of whether or not the diablerie of
their Antediluvian was successful.
System: This power costs six blood points to activate, and it lasts as long as the vampire wishes to remain contained within the soil. As per the Cocoon,
the vampire may use mental Disciplines that do not
require physical solvency or eye contact. He may communicate mentally with anyone who wanders into the
area under which he rests.

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

Chapter Five:
Rules
"For surely it is better to rule in the darkness
than to humble myself falsely in the light."
- The Erciyes Fragments

It may seem odd for a “storytelling game” to have a
specific set of rules that govern how the story plays out,
but remember that the “game” portion of the hobby
shares equal billing with the “storytelling” aspect.
Game rules exist to impart a sense of fairness among
the story participants. When two players attempt to have
an interaction with the world, they know they’re doing
it with the same opportunity, if not the same chances of
success. They may have different dice pools, for example,
or different modifiers affecting what they’re trying to accomplish, but ultimately, they’re interacting with the
world on consistent terms they know will be consistent.
The dice, then, are the agents of fate, not an arbitrary rules system that changes depending on who’s
adjudicating the action. Dramatic fear and uncertainty
come from using the rules wisely in conjunction with
the situations created by the Storyteller.
Luckily, Vampire uses only a few basic rules to get things
done, but these rules can have countless permutations in
the context of the game. This chapter covers the very
basics, such as rolling dice; more specific, detail-oriented
rules can be found throughout the book. Don’t worry about
mastering all the permutations at once — learn these basic
rules first, and then everything else will come naturally.

The Golden Rule
After twenty years, this is still the most important
rule of all, and the only real rule worth following: The
rules are what you make of them. You should fashion this
game into whatever you need it to be. Whether you’re
running a nearly diceless chronicle of in-character socialization or a long-running tactical campaign with
each player controlling a small coterie of vampires, if
the rules in this book interfere with your enjoyment
of the game, change them. The world is far too big —
it can’t be reflected accurately in any set of inflexible
rules. This book is nothing more than a collection of
guidelines, suggested but not mandatory ways of capturing the World of Darkness in the format of a game.
You’re the arbiter of what works best in your game —
mutually determined in play with the Storyteller and
other players — and you’re free to use, alter, abuse,
or ignore these rules at your leisure. Besides, there are
scores of fan communities online that delight in tinkering with the rules to get just the experience they
want, and the exact rule you’re looking for may be just
a Google search away.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Rolling Dice
Vampire uses 10-sided dice. You can find these in
most game stores or through online retailers, or use a
number of software options (including quite a few apps
for smartphones). The Storyteller may need a number of dice; players need plenty as well, but can share
among themselves. Ten dice are all that a beginning
character will need at a given time.
You roll dice whenever the outcome of an action is
in doubt or the Storyteller thinks there’s a chance your
character might fail. Your character’s strengths and
weaknesses affect the number of dice you roll, and thus
directly affect your chances of success. While the dice
are present to give a sense of chance or destiny to a
situation that calls for a roll, they do so objectively for
everyone, so that every player has a fair shake to succeed at her character’s actions, or to fail interestingly.
That last bit is important. If the potential for failure isn’t interesting, the Storyteller should question
whether a roll is even necessary. Calling for a roll slows
down the pace of the game session. Moderating the
pace of the story can be one of the Storyteller’s best
techniques, but Storytellers shouldn’t toss a dice roll
into the proceedings just to alter the tempo. If a roll
of the dice doesn’t create multiple possible interesting
outcomes, there’s not much benefit in calling for one.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, a situation might not
need a roll to proceed with a reasonable outcome.
Consider the use of dice rolls in the following examples:
The characters find themselves in the back room
of a nightclub where an unmarked envelope contains
a clue critical to the plot. Initially, this seems like a
situation that would require, say, a Wits + Investigation roll, but with further consideration, the characters
should probably ultimately find the envelope without
the Storyteller necessitating a dice roll. If the characters don’t find the critical clue, after all, the story can’t
progress. Does the Storyteller really want to trust the
entire future of the storyline to whether or not the dice
turn up in the players’ favor? In fact, with a little different planning, the Storyteller could probably have
avoided this situation altogether, perhaps rewarding
the players’ characters with the envelope at the conclusion of some other challenge — say, among the belongings of a ghoul they overpower or in the library of the
Primogen while they’re snooping around her haven.

246

The characters engage in combat with a Storyteller
character: This is perhaps the archetypal example of
using dice to generate a situation of chance and tension. Here, the outcome isn’t pre-ordained, nor is it
paced at the sole outcome of the Storyteller’s choice.
Combat (and, indeed, most forms of conflict) occur at
the whim of the dice so the players feel risk. They don’t
have story immunity guaranteeing their success or survival. They may ace the engagement — or they may
end up staked, bound, and in the cellar of the Tremere
diablerist.
A character conducts occult research into a necromantic ritual: This is an example of what would
almost certainly be an extended action (see p. 251).
The role of the dice here determines, as is the function
of the extended action rules, how long the occult research actually takes. Does the occultist have a burst of
insight and complete his blasphemous ritual in a single
month? Or do his grisly depredations take half a year to
yield their ghastly results?

Actions
Over the course of a game, a character will do many
things. Some of these tasks are considered actions,
while others aren’t. Actions are anything that might
produce an interesting outcome to the direction the
story takes. Trying to use a Discipline on the Prince,
hiding in the shadows to ambush a rival pack, scaling
a cemetery wall, attempting to forge a damning note
from the Toreador Primogen, rending one’s claws
through the guts of a frenzied Tzimisce — these are
all examples of actions. One action typically takes one
turn to complete. (See p. 254 for more information on
increments of game time.)
In most cases, speaking and conversations aren’t
considered actions. Although interesting developments may certainly arise from things the Kindred say
to one another or to the other residents of the World
of Darkness, talking is typically free in terms of game
mechanics. The Storyteller may rule otherwise, such as
whether a vampire manages to scream out the location
where the Methuselah has the ghouls trapped before
the sunlight burns him to ash, but for the most part,
the game places as few limitations as possible on communication among players and characters.
It’s easy enough to attempt an action — just tell
the Storyteller what your character’s trying to do and
how she plans to go about it. Most actions — cross-

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

ing the street or loading a pistol, for instance — are
easy enough to be considered automatically successful. However, if you’re trying to cross a four-lane highway full of speeding trucks, or trying to reload while
you’re hanging from a fire escape by one hand, there’s
a chance you might fail. So when there’s reasonable
doubt whether an action will succeed or not, you may
have to roll dice to determine the results.
If you need only one success to accomplish an action,
the action in question is called a simple action. Actions
that require more successes or longer periods of time
to complete are called extended actions. See p. 251 for
more information on extended actions.

Reflexive Actions
In some cases, taking a particular significant action
doesn’t actually take any appreciable amount of time.
These actions often come as a result of or are triggered
by other actions. In game terms, these are called reflexive actions, and performing one may break the normal sequence of play and action resolution. A reflexive
action doesn’t require “taking an action” as described
above to accomplish. Your character can perform one
whenever the opportunity arises, and may also take his
normal action, without any penalty.
For instance, spending a blood point to increase an
Attribute is considered to take less than a second of
game time — no dice are rolled, and your character
can do this while doing something else. Soaking —
withstanding the damage from an attack — is likewise
a reflexive action. Making a Humanity roll is a reflexive action, though it may well lead to other, standard
actions.
In most cases, the only prerequisite for performing
a reflexive action is that the character be conscious
(or otherwise capable of choosing to take the action,
in the case of dream sequences or other deviations
from consciousness that still allow choice) in order to
choose to do so. Unless otherwise specified, a character
may perform any number of reflexive actions, and they
don’t get in the way of anything else she may want to
do in a turn.

Ratings
Although your character’s personality is limited only
by your imagination, his capabilities are defined by his
Traits — all of his innate and learned aptitudes and

abilities. Each Trait is described by a “dot” rating of 1
to 5 (usually); a 1 in a Trait is barely competent, while
a 5 is the pinnacle of human achievement. Most people’s Traits range from 1 to 3; a 4 in a Trait indicates an
exceptional person, while a 5 is nearly incomparable
— among humans, at any rate. Think of this as similar
to the “star” rating system of movie reviews and restaurants — a 1 is barely passable while a 5 is superb. It’s
also possible to have a zero in a Trait, which usually
represents a skill that the character never learned, but
some exceptions (such as the hideous Nosferatu’s lack
of an Appearance Trait) do occur.

Dice Pools
Whenever you roll dice, you roll one die for every dot
your character possesses in the appropriate Trait. For
instance, if your character is trying to find something
and he has three dots in Perception, you would roll
three dice. However, you almost never simply roll the
number of dice you have in an Attribute. Raw potential is modified by skill, after all, and so the most common rolls in the game involve adding the dice gained
from an Attribute to the dice gained from an Ability.
For instance, if your character were trying to trick
the Nosferatu elder’s ghoul into revealing her master’s
location, the Storyteller might have you roll Manipulation + Subterfuge: an Attribute plus an Ability. In
this case, you might take three dice for your Manipulation of 3, plus as many dice as your character has in
Subterfuge — say, two — so you get two more dice
from that. Thus, you roll a total of five dice to determine your character’s success or failure at confounding the ghoul. These dice are called the dice pool: the
total number of dice you roll for a single action. Most
often, you’ll calculate a dice pool for only one action
at a time, though you can modify it to be able to perform multiple tasks in a turn (for more information, see
“Multiple Actions,” below).
Not every roll requires an Ability to be added to an
Attribute. For example, lifting an object is a pure application of Strength alone, while a Humanity roll to

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

247

test for moral degradation obviously draws its dice pool
solely from the Humanity Trait.
If your dice pool involves a Trait whose maximum
rating is 10 (such as Humanity, Path, or Willpower),
you can’t add any other Traits to your dice pool. It’s effectively impossible for a normal human being to have
more than 10 dice in a dice pool.
Elder vampires, on the other hand.…

Multiple Actions
Occasionally, a player will want her character to perform more than one action in a turn. For example, a
character may be trying to search through a notebook
to find a password while creeping stealthily through a
hallway, or might be trying to sidestep an incoming
attack while firing a pistol into her assailant’s gut. In
such situations, the player can attempt actions normally, though all actions become more difficult as the
character’s attention is split among them.
The player declares the total number of actions he
wishes his character to attempt and determines which
of those dice pools is the smallest. He may then allocate that number dice among the actions as he sees fit.
Example: You want your character to hang a sharp
right turn in a stolen taxi cab while simultaneously screaming at the surprised cabbie in the passenger seat to calm the
hell down or you’ll tear him in half. This is a Dexterity +
Drive roll (for which your character has seven dice) and
a Charisma + Intimidation roll (for which your character
has five dice). Five dice is the smaller dice pool, and you
may thus divide five dice among the number of actions you
want to take. That is, you may allocate these five dice as
you see fit between the driving maneuver and intimidating
the cabbie.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, certain action combinations that are wildly disparate may incur a difficulty
increase (see below) on top of the split dice pool limitations. Composing a stirring poem while showering an
enemy with a hail of bullets is a task not lightly undertaken. As well, at the Storyteller’s discretion, splitting
dice pools to a certain degree may well just be plain
impossible.
Vampires with the Discipline of Celerity (p. 142)
may take multiple actions without subtracting dice
from their dice pools. These extra actions may not
themselves be divided into multiple actions.

248

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

Difficulties
There’s no point in rolling dice unless you know what
results you’re looking for. Whenever you try to perform
an action, the Storyteller will decide on an appropriate
difficulty number and tell you her decision. A difficulty
is always a number between 2 and 10 (but generally
between 3 and 9). Each time you score that number or
higher on one of your dice, you’re considered to have
gained a success. For example, if an action’s difficulty is
a 6 and you roll a 3, 3, 8, 7 and 10, then you’ve scored
three successes. The more you get, the better you do.
You need only one success to perform most actions successfully, but that’s considered a marginal success. If
you score three or more, you succeed completely. Also,
a result of a 10 is always a success, no matter the difficulty number.
The following charts should give you a good idea of
how to combine difficulties and degrees of success.

Degrees of Success
One Success
			
			
			

Marginal (getting a 		
broken refrigerator to 		
keep running until the 		
repairman arrives)

Two Successes
			
			

Moderate (making a 		
handicraft that’s ugly but
useful)

Three		
		
			

Complete (fixing 		
something so that it’s 		
good as new)

Four		
			
			
			

Exceptional (increasing
your car’s efficiency in 		
the process of repairing 		
it)

Five or More
			

Phenomenal (creating a
masterwork)

Difficulties
The Storyteller is the final authority on how difficult
attempted actions are — if the task seems impossible,
he’ll make the difficulty appropriately high, while if the
task seems routinely easy, the difficulty will be low (if
the Storyteller decides you even have to roll at all). A
difficulty 3 task is so easy that it probably doesn’t merit
a die roll, but a fluke failure or extraordinary success
might sometimes make it worth the chance.

Three
		

Trivial (scanning a small crowd 		
for a familiar face)

Four

Easy (following a trail of blood)

Five
		

Straightforward (seducing some		
one who’s already “in the mood”)

Six		

Standard (firing a gun)

Seven
		

Challenging (locating where 		
those agonized whispers are 		
coming from)

Eight
		

Difficult (convincing a cop that
this isn’t your cocaine)

At difficulty 10, the results curve becomes very anomalous – indeed, there are a few dice pools for which the
likelihood of botching actually increases over having a
smaller (and thus theoretically “worse”) dice pool. Be careful when assigning such a high difficulty to an action.

Nine
		

Extremely difficult (walking a 		
tightrope)

Failure

Naturally, the lower the difficulty, the easier it is to
score successes, and vice versa. Six is the default difficulty, indicating actions neither exceptionally tricky
nor exceptionally easy to accomplish. If the Storyteller
or rulebook ever calls for you to make a roll, but doesn’t
give you a specific difficulty number, assume the task is
difficulty 6.

If you score no successes on a roll, your character
fails his attempted action: He misses his punch. The
file is encrypted too well. The Prince doesn’t believe
her alibi. Failure, while usually disappointing, is not so
catastrophic as a botch (below).
Example: Your character is attempting to eavesdrop on
the greasy-looking guy with a bag of pills who’s talking to
the blonde in the corner of the bar, and is trying to look
nonchalant by the pool table. The Storyteller tells you to

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

249

roll your character’s Wits + Subterfuge (difficulty 7). You
roll and the dice turn up 2, 5, 6, 6, 4, 3 — no successes.
The Storyteller rules that the greasy guy notices you making an awkward show of pretending to chalk your cue
and stops talking to the girl, staring your character down
instead. He doesn’t draw a weapon or bolt for the back
door, but whatever this deal is isn’t going any further….
Storytellers, bear in mind that failure is simply that:
failure. All it means is that the attempt didn’t produce
the desired result. Judge the narrative accordingly, but
a failure probably doesn’t in itself result in any harm
to the character unless the circumstances would dictate such. A failed attempt to jump the gap between
two buildings probably doesn’t result in a breakneck
plummet, but perhaps the character lands clumsily on
a fire escape below the intended rooftop, or maybe she
knocks the wind out of herself and is desperately hanging onto the ledge.

Botches
Bad luck can ruin anything. One more basic of a roll
is a “botch.” Whenever one of the dice comes up as a
1, it cancels out a success. Completely. Take the die
showing 1 and one of the dice showing a success and
set them aside. In this manner, an otherwise successful
action may be reduced to failure.
Occasionally, truly bad fortune strikes. If none of
your dice comes up a success, and one or more dice are
dice showing 1, the roll is a botch. If you score at least
one success, even if that success is canceled out and
additional 1s remain, it’s just a simple failure.
A botch is much worse than a normal failure — it’s
dramatic misfortune. For instance, rolling a botch
when trying to fast-talk the Sheriff might make him
think you’d better go see the Prince to explain yourself.
Botching a Stealth roll when breaking into an apartment makes so much racket the neighbor calls the police. Botching an Animal Ken roll enrages the animal.
Botching an Athletics roll means you gauged the width
of the gap between the two buildings incorrectly... and
look at all that chain-link fence and razor wire rising up
to meet you. The Storyteller decides exactly what goes
wrong; a botch may produce a minor inconvenience or
might result in wholesale catastrophe.
Of course, some Storytellers may find that botches
are cropping up a little too frequently in their chronicles (the laws of probability often warp around dice,
as any veteran roleplayer can attest). In that case, it’s
the Storyteller’s privilege to give everyone, player and

250

Storyteller character alike, one botch “free” — in other words, the first botched roll of the session doesn’t
count. This rule tends to make unlife a little easier on
the players — but then again, there’s less chance of
their enemies suffering a run of bad luck as well.…
Example: Your character is desperately fleeing from the
Archbishop’s most zealous Paladins, and all that’s standing between him and the safety of his haven is a freight
elevator that leads up to the service docks of the meatpacking plant. You roll your character’s Stamina + Athletics
(difficulty 8), hoping to outpace your pursuers to the
elevator and get 9, 1, 1, 8, 1. The 1s outnumber the successes, but because you rolled any successes at all to begin
with, the action simply fails. The Storyteller rules that you
make it to the elevator — but it’s two floors up.
You dash toward the staircase, but you’re not so lucky as
the chase continues. The Stamina + Athletics dice come up
1, 3, 4, 3, 7. This time, not only did a “1” occur, but no
successes were scored at all, so the action is a botch. The
Storyteller rules that the Sabbat thought you might try to
run away like a punk bitch, and backed a forklift into the
stairwell, blocking it entirely. No choice but to turn around
and face them....
Botching is a place where some creativity on the
part of the Storyteller goes a long way. There’s nothing wrong with having a botch signify a dropped gun
or stalling out a car in a chase, but a botch might also
be an odd fluke that happens at an incongruous time
or a butterfly effect that may haunt the chronicle at
a later point. Instead of dropping the gun, maybe a
botched firearms roll signifies that the gun went off to
close to the shooter’s face, blinding or deafening her.
Maybe the botched Drive roll suggests that, as the car
fishtailed around the corner, the captive Toreador in
the back seat made a break for it or the manila envelope full of the incriminating photos fell out the open
window. Botches should create a new dramatic twist to
the scene in which they occur. They don’t have to be
reliable pratfalls.

Automatic Success
Sometimes rolling dice is unnecessary, particularly
when the task is a relatively simple one for a character,
or when there’s not much at dramatic stake to necessitate determining how well a character succeeds or
fails. Remember, anything that streamlines play and
reduces distractions is a good thing. Vampire employs
a simple system for automatic successes, allowing you

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

to skip rolling for tasks that your character would find
frankly mundane.
Simply put, if the number of dice in your dice pool is
equal to or greater than the task’s difficulty, your character automatically succeeds. No dice roll is necessary.
Mind you, this does not work for all tasks, and never
works in combat or other stressful situations. Furthermore, an automatic success is considered marginal, just
as if you’d gotten only one success on the roll. If quality
is an issue — the dramatic necessity mentioned earlier — you might want to roll the dice pool anyway to
try for more successes (although you still risk potential
failure). But for simple and often-repeated actions, this
system works just fine.
There’s another way to get an automatic success on
a roll: Simply spend a Willpower point (p. 267). You
can do this only once per turn, and since you have a
limited supply of Willpower you can’t do this too often,
but it can certainly help when you’re under pressure to
succeed.

Trying It Again
Failure often produces stress, which often leads to
further failure. If a character fails an action, he may
usually try it again (after all, failing to pick a lock does
not mean the character may never try to pick the lock
again). In such cases, though, the Storyteller should
increase the difficulty number of the second attempt by
one. (Note that the Storyteller may choose not to increase this difficulty, at her discretion.) If the attempt is
failed yet again, the difficulty of a third attempt should
increase by two, and so on. Eventually, the difficulty
will be so high that the character has no chance of succeeding: The lock is simply beyond her ability to pick
and she’s frustrated with the whole affair.
Examples of when to use this rule are: climbing a
fence, searching a computer archive, or interrogating
a prisoner. After all, if you couldn’t find a handhold,
discern the proper file name, or get the prisoner to talk
the first time, there’s a reasonable chance you might
not be able to do it at all.
Sometimes the Storyteller shouldn’t invoke this rule.
For example, failing to shoot somebody with a gun, detect an ambush, or keep on another driver’s tail are
to be expected in stressful situations. Such failure does
not automatically lead to frustration and failed future
attempts. The intent with the Trying It Again rules is
to increase the likelihood of either success or interesting failure.

Example: Your character has been “asked” to do a
little bit of liaising between an up-and-coming Ventrue
and a pack of Gangrel who claim the domain the Ventrue wants as her own. You’re meeting the pack’s bigshot
behind a coffee shop in an ethnic ghetto, and things aren’t
going well. You try to put a positive spin on the Ventrue’s
interest in the Gangrel domain, so the Storyteller suggests
that you roll Wits + Streetwise (difficulty 6) to gracefully
describe the Gangrel domain as a liability they’d be better
off letting go. You roll the dice, but your effort fails, and
the Gangrel leader objects to your characterization of his
domain as a shit-stained urban blight. You try to make
amends, but this time the Storyteller tells you the difficulty
is 7. Your character has some backpedaling to do, but you
can’t backpedal so far that you make the Gangrel want to
stay. Good luck.

Complications
The preceding rules should be enough to get you
going, and for chronicles that favor storytelling over
dice-rolling, they might be all you ever need. However,
they don’t necessarily cover all instances — for example, what if you’re trying to do something while a Storyteller character is actively trying to stop you? What if
a fellow Tremere tries to help you uncover a ritual?
The various ways to complicate matters below are
intended to bring extra color to games. You don’t have
to use them, but they might add more realism and suspense to your game.
The following complications are relatively simple and
generic, usable to describe a wide variety of actions. For
situation-specific complications, see Chapter Six.

Extended Actions
Sometimes completing a task takes longer than the
increment of time in which the Storyteller chooses to
conduct the scene. When you need multiple successes
to score even a marginal success, you’re undertaking
an extended action. For example, a Nosferatu might
spend all night listening in on a conversation between
to scheming Kindred, or a Gangrel might be engaged
in fleeing (or pursuing…) mortal police for a prolonged
period of time.
In an extended action, you roll your dice pool over
and over at subsequent intervals, trying to collect
enough successes to succeed. For example, your character is trying to dig a temporary haven in the forest

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

251

floor, using only his bare hands. The Storyteller tells
you that you need 15 successes to hollow out a den
that provides sufficient protection from the sun. You’ll
eventually succeed, but the longer you go, the more
chance there is of you botching and collapsing the
tunnel. What’s more, if you have only so many turns
before dawn, the speed with which you finish your task
becomes doubly important. The Storyteller in all cases
is the final authority on which tasks are extended actions and which aren’t.
You can usually take as many turns as you want to
finish an extended action (but situations being what
they are in Vampire, you won’t always have that luxury). If you botch a roll, however, you probably have
to start over again from scratch, and likely have some
other resultant catastrophe to worry about. Depending
on what you’re trying to do, the Storyteller may even
rule that you can’t start over again at all; you’ve failed
and that’s that.
Because extended actions are often quite apropos
for describing certain feats, they’re used frequently in
Chapter Six. However, because of the amount of dicerolling involved, extended actions should probably be
kept out of the more intense sessions of roleplaying.
Note that the interval for a roll in an extended action
need not be only a turn. It can be any segment of game
time as determined by the Storyteller. For example, a
Giovanni searching tombs for corpses with special qualities might roll once to determine the progress made
in a night’s grave robbing. A Ventrue might attempt a
long-term seduction of a rival’s mortal daughter. Many
protracted Discipline powers (like Conditioning) invoke extended actions that take place over a long period of time. For more information on time intervals
and how they relate to game systems, see p. 254.
Example: Veronica Abbey-Roth is trying to drum up
a large portion of capital for a certain upcoming project
of hers. Even though she has Resources 4, the Storyteller
rules that she’d have to liquidate much of her belongings
to get the money she wants. So Veronica decides to play
fast and dirty with her money, running a number of illegal
operations and playing a very intricate game with the
stock market to raise the money she needs. The Storyteller
decides that for Veronica to reach her goal, Lynn will have
to score 18 successes on an extended Wits + Finance roll
(difficulty 7 — this is an intrinsically tricky way to earn
money). What’s more, since this sort of thing takes time,
she can make only one roll per night of game time.

252

Veronica has Wits 3 and Finance 4, so Lynn rolls seven
dice each night. She gets three successes on her first roll —
things are opening up nicely. On her second roll, she gets
two successes, for a total of five. Unfortunately, luck isn’t
with her on the third roll. She gets 3, 4, 1, 6, 4, 1, 6 — a
botch! The Storyteller rules that one of Veronica’s brokers
has gone sour, and she’s actually lost money on the transaction. But the efforts of three nights’ work have been neatly
condensed into five minutes or so of real time. As the game
continues, Veronica is left with a tighter budget for a while,
and the choice of trying again (and running the risk of attracting the Justice Department’s attention) or abandoning
her grandiose plot.…

Resisted Actions
A simple difficulty number might not be enough to
represent a struggle between characters. For instance,
you may try to batter down a door while a character on the other side tries to hold it closed. In such
a case, you’d make a resisted roll — each of you rolls
dice against a difficulty (often determined by one of
your opponent’s Traits), and the person who scores the
most successes wins.
However, you’re considered to score only as many
successes as the amount by which you exceed your opponent’s successes. In other words, the opponent’s successes eliminate your own, just as 1s do. If, for example, you
score four successes and your opponent scores three,
you’re considered to have only one success: a marginal
accomplishment. It’s difficult to achieve an outstanding success on a resisted action simply because someone else is working to prevent you from achieving your
objective. Even if your opponent can’t beat you, he can
still diminish the effect of your efforts.
Some actions (debating an opponent in front of an
assembled Elysium, a cat-and-mouse pursuit) may be
both extended and resisted. In such cases, one or the
other of the opponents must achieve a certain number
of successes to succeed. Each success above the rival’s
total number in a given turn is added to a running tally.
The first to achieve the designated number of successes
wins the contest.
Example: Veronica, prowling for trouble at the latest
Camarilla soiree, has determined by night’s end to spite
her rival, a Ventrue by the name of Giselle. Giselle arrived at the fête with her latest childe in tow: Tony, a
talented and delicious young man with a medical license
and a much-vaunted pedigree. Veronica decides that there
would be nothing more amusing than stealing Giselle’s

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

childe away from her for the evening — of course, that’ll
take some doing, as Giselle will be watching him like a
hawk.
Lynn (Veronica’s player) and the Storyteller roleplay
out much of the initial three-way conversation (as well as
the covert knife-edged glances) between Veronica, Giselle,
and Tony. Finally, the Storyteller has Lynn roll Veronica’s
Manipulation (3) + Subterfuge (3), resisted by Giselle’s
Manipulation (3) + Subterfuge (4). Lynn rolls six dice versus a difficulty of 7 (Giselle’s Manipulation + Subterfuge).
The Storyteller rolls Giselle’s seven dice versus difficulty 6
(Veronica’s Manipulation + Subterfuge). Lynn manages
to score four successes, while Giselle remarkably manages
only three. Giselle’s successes subtract from Lynn’s, leaving Lynn with one success. Tony opts to make the rounds
with Veronica, although her marginal success means he
casts a few longing glances Giselle’s way.…

Teamwork
You don’t always have to go it alone. If the situation warrants (usually during an extended action such
as staking out a suspected Sabbat or decoding an Aramaic inscription), characters can work together to collect successes. If the Storyteller decides that teamwork
is possible for the task in question, two or more characters can make rolls separately and add their successes
together. Their players do this by each rolling their
own character’s appropriate dice pool (they do not
combine their Traits into one dice pool).

Teamwork can be effective in many situations — restraining the frenzied Gangrel, gathering some physical
resource, or doing research in the library, for instance.
However, it can actually prove to be a hindrance in
certain situations (including most social interaction
such as fast-talking or seducing a subject, where too
many people can overwhelm a single subject). As well,
one person’s botch can bollix the whole attempt.

Using the Storyteller Dice
Pool System
One of the greatest strengths of the Storyteller system is its flexibility. Storytellers should keep the versatile nature of the core dice pool rule system in mind
when establishing challenges and resolving conflict. A
given situation might have multiple possible resolutions under the dice pool system. For example, a car
chase might be resolved using the contested action
system, or it might be resolved with extended actions,
with each participant in the chase “racing” to accumulate a number of successes before the other.
The best advice to Storytellers here is to use what
best suits the pacing and objectives of the story. If the
players are getting antsy, let them roll some dice. If
they’re more interested in the interpersonal relations
of the session, use a simpler resolution with less attention to dice rolls.

there’s no “right” way to resolve a dramatic situation.
Go with what feels right, what emphasizes your troupe’s
tastes for narrative or gameplay, and what gets the best
response from everyone at the table. The system isn’t
a blunt instrument to be wielded by the Storyteller
against the players at the table; it’s the tool that you
mutually employ to tell a thrilling story.

of any number of scenes interconnected by downtime
(see below); essentially, like a chapter in a novel or an
act in a play.

Time

• Chronicle — A series of stories connected by the
characters themselves and their ongoing narrative, possibly even by a common theme or overarching plot.

Over the course of the game, time is presumed to
pass as it would in the normal world — Tuesday follows Monday, month after month, and so on. However, there’s no need to devote attention to every second
ticking away. There’s a huge difference between the
speeds at which time in the game world and real time
pass. Over a four-hour game session, a week, month, or
even year might pass in the setting of the game — or
the entire session might be spent detailing the events
of an action-packed half-hour. You can play out a combat turn by turn, taking it in three-second increments,
or you can let months pass away in a few minutes of
real time. In the Storyteller system, the passage of time
without players taking any real actions is called “downtime,” and learning to use this little trick can help the
pacing of a Storyteller’s chronicle immensely.
To help maintain a general sense of the passage of
time without resorting to tedious charts and the like,
Vampire uses six basic units to describe game time:
• Turn — The amount of time you need to take a
fairly simple action. This can range anywhere from
three seconds to three minutes, depending on the pace
of a given scene.
• Scene — Like the basic division of plays and movies, a scene is a compact period of action and interaction that takes place in a single location. This could be
the storming of a Tremere chantry, or a moonlit conversation on a park bench. There are exactly as many
turns in a scene as the scene requires — there might
not even be any turns if the scene consists of nothing
but dialogue and character interaction. As well, the
length of a turn can vary from one scene to the next in
a chronicle. A combat scene might have frenzied action with short turns, while a suspenseful scene might
have a slower pace in which the turns culminate in a
burst of revelation.

• Story — A full tale, complete with introduction,
rising action, and climax. Some stories can take several chapters to complete. Others can be finished in
one. Some short stories are effectively vignettes that
are nothing more than a single scene.

• Downtime — Time that is “glossed over” with description rather than played out turn by turn or scene
by scene. If the Storyteller says, “You wait in the foyer for four hours before the Prince’s ghoul summons
you,” rather than actually letting the characters play
out their wait, the Storyteller is considered to be invoking downtime. Downtime allows trivial or tedious
passages of time to be played through quickly. If the
Storyteller allows it, players may conduct simple, unchallenged activities during downtime — “You stop by
your haven to pick up the Inquisitor’s rosary before you
arrive at the Prince’s manor.” Alternatively, a situation
that begins as downtime might become a turn, scene,
or even story if the players decide to undertake something dramatic in what the Storyteller thought would
be glossed-over time. Finally, such bursts of downtime
might be explored by players outside the troupe — see
p. 361 for more.

Examples of Rolls
The Storyteller rules system is designed with flexibility in mind, and as a result, there are about 270
combinations of Attributes and Abilities. This daunting number is just the beginning, too — you can certainly use Hobby Talent, Professional Skill, and Expert
Knowledge (see Chapter Three) to devise more Abilities if you think there’s need. In this manner, you have
a huge variety of rolls to simulate actions — whatever
you think is most appropriate. The following examples
of rolls are meant to give you some idea of the possibilities that might come up in a game.
• You want to conduct yourself flawlessly at the governor’s formal dinner (and you can’t actually eat anything). Roll Dexterity + Etiquette (difficulty 8).

• Chapter — An independent part of a story, virtually always played out in one game session. It consists

CHAPTER FIVE: RULES

• You’re miles from your haven, and the sun will
be up soon. Roll Wits + Survival (difficulty 7) to find
shelter for the day.

• Did she just threaten you? Roll Perception + Intimidation (difficulty 5) to figure out what that Lick
meant by that comment.

• You try to distract the bodyguard with your left
hand while surreptitiously slipping your knife back into
your belt with your right. Roll Dexterity + Subterfuge
(difficulty of the bodyguard’s Perception + Alertness).

• You try to get his attention by driving your knife
through his hand and into the oak bar. Roll Strength +
Melee (difficulty 6).

• You lock gazes with the gang leader, trying to cow
him into submission before his gang — and he wants to
do the same to you. Make a Charisma + Intimidation
roll, resisted by his Charisma + Intimidation.
• The ritual requires three days of nonstop chanting.
Can you stay awake even through the daylight hours to
finish it? Roll Stamina + Occult (difficulty 9).
• You need to board up the door to your haven in
record speed — and it needs to be durable, too. Roll
Wits + Crafts (difficulty 7).
• You’ve got access to the chantry library for exactly one night — you’d better find the name you want
quickly, but there are a lot of books here. Roll Wits +
Occult (difficulty 8) every hour; you need to achieve
15 successes.
• It’s not the message of the song, but it’s how good
you look singing it. Roll Appearance + Performance
(difficulty 6) to have your choice of groupies.
• How long can you remain motionless in the bushes
while the guards chat about the football game? Roll
Stamina + Stealth (difficulty 7). Each success allows
you to hold still for one hour.
• It would be foolish to threaten your rival openly
while in the confines of Elysium. Roll Manipulation +
Intimidation (difficulty 8) to properly veil your threat
without leaving her in doubt as to your intentions.
• Suddenly, a man pushes a crate out of the van
you’ve been chasing — roll Wits + Drive (difficulty 6)
to swerve out of the way in time.
• Can you distract the guard dogs while you slip in?
Roll Manipulation + Animal Ken (difficulty 8).

• You try to pull alongside the fleeing Mercedes so
your friends can leap aboard. Make an extended Dexterity + Drive roll, resisted by the Mercedes driver’s
Wits + Drive. If you accumulate five total successes
more than his total successes, you’re in position. If he
accumulates a total of five more successes than you get,
he escapes.
• The new gang in town’s been awfully good at
picking out Kindred-run operations to take over. Roll
Charisma + Streetwise (difficulty 8) to see what people
know about them. The more successes you get, the
more information you receive, but the legwork will
take an entire night regardless.
• What sort of alarm system does this place have?
Roll Perception + Larceny (difficulty 6).
• Whose story will the Prince believe — yours or
your enemy’s? Roll Manipulation + Expression, resisted by your rival’s Manipulation + Expression.
• You try convincing the clerk of the court that
you’re an IRS auditor and that you need to see the
court records. Roll Manipulation + Finance (difficulty
8).
• Can you read the German edition of The Book of
Nod without losing something in the translation? Roll
Intelligence + Academics (difficulty 8).
• You have to keep running if you’re going to outdistance your pursuers. Make an extended Stamina +
Athletics roll (difficulty 7); if you collect 15 successes,
you’ve outlasted them.
• You need to convince the judge to release you before the sun rises. Roll Charisma + Law (difficulty 8) to
make a plea eloquent enough.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Chapter Six:
Systems
and Drama
“Mortals thought they were fighting their own wars, but it is
for us that they spilt their blood.”
-The Book of Nod

While Vampire’s focus is on roleplaying and character interaction, dramatic scenes often involve some element of dice rolling. As Chapter Five shows, the basic
Storyteller rules are designed to streamline this process
as much as possible, allowing you to pay attention to
the story. To assist you and the Storyteller further, this
chapter covers more specific dice mechanics, including
general dramatic systems, combat, injury, and recovery.
If, in your chronicles, you come up with a resolution
system you like better, by all means use it, as discussed
on p. 245 (“The Golden Rule”). Also — particularly
when dealing with social actions like seductions and
diplomacy — the dice should never get in the way of
roleplaying. If a player has his character make a particularly inspired (or painful) speech, deliver a particularly smooth (or cheesy) opening line, or come up with
a brilliant (or laughable) alibi, feel free to let the character succeed (or fail) automatically, regardless of what
the dice and Traits say.

Dramatic Systems
The only things limiting your actions are your imagination and your character’s skill. During a game session,

characters — both player and Storyteller personalities
— may attempt numerous diverse and complicated activities. The Storyteller is responsible for keeping all
of this action organized while determining success or
failure for all characters.
Dramatic systems simplify the Storyteller’s job by
supplying rules for a number of common activities.
Generally, a character attempting to accomplish a task
adds together an Attribute and an Ability. If a task falls
within a character’s specialty (p. 96), that character
gains two successes in place instead of one for each
“10” the player achieves on his roll.
Storytellers should, and will undoubtedly have to,
invent their own dramatic systems for new situations.
The list of systems below is in no way exhaustive, but
provides a solid foundation on which to base events.
Bear in mind that for rolls involving Talents and Skills,
characters lacking a specific Ability may default to the
Attribute on which the Ability is based (albeit at +1
difficulty for Skill-based actions).
Most of these systems involve taking one or more
actions (p. 246) over one or more turns (p. 254). A
number of these systems may be tried again if the first
attempt is unsuccessful. Subsequent efforts may suffer

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

257

a difficulty penalty, at the Storyteller’s discretion (see
“Trying It Again,” p. 251).

Automatic Feats
Automatic feats require the character to take an
action, but don’t involve a dice pool roll under most
circumstances. The following are common automatic
feats. Storytellers may decide that other feats are automatic, at their discretion.
• Blood Use (Healing, Augmenting Attributes,
etc.): Vampire characters may spend blood to heal
themselves. To do so, the character must concentrate
and do nothing else for one full turn. A character may
attempt to heal while performing other actions, but
this requires success on a Stamina + Survival reflexive
roll (difficulty 8). Failing this roll means the vampire
loses all expended blood points with no effect, while
a botch causes the vampire to lose both an additional
blood point and an additional health level. Spending
blood to raise Physical Attributes or power Disciplines
may be done automatically, without the need for concentration. A character may spend an amount of vitae
equal to her per-turn rating, as dictated by her Generation (p. 270).
• Getting to Your Feet: Characters may rise from
the ground in one turn without making a roll. If a character wishes to get to her feet while doing something
else in the same turn, she must take a multiple action
(see “Multiple Actions,” p. 248) with a Dexterity +
Athletics roll (difficulty 4) to rise successfully.
• Movement: Characters may choose to walk, jog,
or run. If walking, a character moves at seven yards/
meters per turn. If jogging, a character moves at (12 +
Dexterity) yards/meters per turn. If all-out running, a
character moves at (20 + [3 x Dexterity]) yards/meters
per turn.
Characters may move at up to half maximum running speed, then subsequently attack or perform another action; see p. 274 for particulars. Characters may
also wish to move while taking another action. This is
possible, but each yard or meter moved subtracts one
from the other action’s dice pool.
Note that injured characters (p. 282) cannot move
at maximum speed.
• Readying a Weapon: This can involve drawing
a weapon or reloading a gun with a prepared clip. In
most cases, no roll is required, so long as the character
takes no other action that turn. If the character wishes
to ready a weapon while doing something else in the

258

same turn, the player must reduce his dice pool (see
“Multiple Actions,” p. 248) and roll Dexterity + Melee
or Firearms (difficulty 4) for the readying attempt.
• Starting a Car: This takes an action, but requires
no roll.
• Yielding: The character allows the character with
the next-highest initiative (p. 271) to act. She may
still act at the end of the turn. If all characters (player
and Storyteller) yield during a turn, no one does anything that turn.

Physical Feats
These systems cover actions involving the three
Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina). These feats typically require a roll. Remember that
Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence add dice to Physical
Attributes when making many of these rolls.
• Climbing [Dexterity + Athletics]: When your
character climbs an inclined surface (rocky slope, side
of building), roll Dexterity + Athletics. Climbing is
typically an extended roll. For an average climb with
available handholds and nominal complications, your
character moves 10 feet (three meters) for every success. The Storyteller adjusts this distance based on the
climb’s difficulty (easier: 15 feet/five meters per success; more difficult: five feet/two meters per success).
The number of handholds, smoothness of the surface,
and environmental factors can all affect rate of travel.
A short, difficult climb may have the same difficulty
as a long, easy climb. The extended action lasts until
you’ve accumulated enough successes to reach the desired height. Botching a climbing roll can be bad: Your
character may only slip or get stuck, or she may fall.
If the character activates the Protean power of Feral
Claws, constructs bone spurs with the Vicissitude power of Bonecraft, or uses a similar power to assist them,
all climbing difficulties are reduced by two.
• Driving [Dexterity/Wits + Drive]: A Drive roll
isn’t needed to steer a vehicle under normal circumstances, assuming your character has at least one dot
in the Drive Skill. That said, bad weather, the vehicle’s speed, obstacles, and complex maneuvers can
challenge even the most competent drivers. Specific
difficulties based on these circumstances are up to the
Storyteller, but should increase as the conditions become more hazardous.
For example, driving in heavy rain is +1 difficulty,
but going fast while also trying to lose pursuers increases the difficulty to +3. Similarly, maneuvering in heavy

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

traffic is +1, but doing so at a breakneck pace while
avoiding pursuit bumps the difficulty to +3. A failed
roll indicates trouble, requiring an additional roll to
avoid crashing or losing control. Characters in control
of a vehicle, and who have no dots in the Drive Skill,
need a roll for almost every change in course or procedure. On a botch, the vehicle may spin out of control
or worse.
Because different cars handle differently — some are
designed for speed and handling while others are designed for safety — the following chart helps calculate
the difficulty for any maneuver. Generally, for every 10

miles or 15 kilometers per hour over the safe driving
speed of a vehicle, the difficulty of any maneuver is
increased by one. Exceedingly challenging stunts and
bad road conditions should also increase the difficulty
accordingly. The maximum number of dice a driver can
have in her dice pool when driving is equal to the maneuver rating of the vehicle. Simply put, even the best
driver will have more trouble with a dump truck than
she will with a Ferrari.
• Carrying Capacity [Strength]: A character can
carry 25 lbs/10 kg per point of Strength without penalty. Should a character exceed this total, every action

involving physical skills incurs an automatic +1 difficulty due to the added weight. Also, every 25 lbs/10
kg over the limit halves the character’s base movement
(see “Movement,” p. 258). A character bearing a total
weight of double her Strength allocation can’t move.
This system is a guideline, intended to reflect being
laden by bulk and weight, so the Storyteller should not
call for an inventory accounting every time your character picks up a pen.
• Hunting [Various]: It is the nature of the vampire to hunt. For each hour the vampire spends search-

ing for human prey, allow the player to make a roll
against a difficulty based on the area in which the vampire hunts. The Attribute and Ability combination
used should correspond to the method by which the
player describes the character’s hunting technique. For
example, Appearance + Subterfuge might represent a
lusty tryst at a nightclub that ends in one of the lovers slaking her thirst, Stamina + Athletics would suggest a harrowing chase across a swath of city parkland,
and Wits + Streetwise might be interpreted as a deadly
game of cat-and-mouse.

Success on this roll indicates that the vampire has
found and subdued prey, in a manner appropriate to
her methods and the area. She may now ingest as many
blood points as she wishes to take from the victim (or,
if the Storyteller prefers, a single die’s worth of blood
points). Failure indicates that the hour is spent looking fruitlessly, while a botch indicates a complication
(perhaps the character accidentally kills a vessel, picks
up a disease, enters the domain of a rival vampire, or
suffers assault from a street gang). If a botch does occur,
the Storyteller should quickly set up the scene and let
the character try to work her way out of trouble. Storytellers and players should both be creative in proposing
and describing the hunt to make it dramatic and exciting. After all, finding prey isn’t necessarily the hard
part — it’s holding on to one’s Humanity or preserving
the Masquerade when the Beast hungers.
If the character catches prey, but currently has fewer
blood points in her body than [7 minus Self-Control or
Instincts], the character is considered to be hungry and
a frenzy check (p. 298) is necessary — Self-Control to
see if the character frenzies, or Instincts to see if the
character can control her frenzy while feeding. If the
player fails this roll, the character continues to gorge
on the vessel until she is completely sated (at full blood
pool), the victim dies from blood loss, or she somehow
manages to regain control of herself.
The Fame and Domain Backgrounds reduce difficulties of hunting rolls by one per dot (to a minimum of
3), while the Herd Background adds one die per dot
in the Background (so long as one’s herd could conceivably be in the area). However, Storytellers may
increase hunting difficulties for particularly inhuman
vampires (Nosferatu, some Gangrel, vampires with
Humanity ratings of 4 or below, or who are on Paths
of Enlightenment), as such monsters find it difficult to
blend in with a crowd.
For more information on hunting scenes, see p. 365.
• Intrusion [Dexterity/Perception + Larceny]: Intrusion covers breaking and entering, evading simple

260

security devices, picking locks, cracking safes — and
preventing others from doing the same. When bypassing active security, your roll must succeed on the first attempt, and failure activates any alarms present (opening
manual locks may be attempted multiple times, though).
Intrusion rolls can range from 5 (standard locks) to 9
(Fort Knox), depending on a security system’s complexity (the Storyteller decides the actual difficulty). Certain
tasks might require a minimum level of Larceny Skill for
the character to have any chance of succeeding (e.g.,
Larceny 1 might let you pick a simple lock, but not crack
a safe). Bear in mind that most intrusion tasks require
lockpicks or other appropriate tools. On a botch, the
character’s clumsy break-in attempt goes horribly awry.
Setting up security measures is a standard action, but
multiple successes achieved in the effort increase the
system’s quality (essentially adding to the difficulty for
it to be breached).
Note, here, that the Larceny Skill comes into question when evading the physical, mechanical aspects of
the intrusion effort. Dealing with the technology behind the systems themselves involves the Technology
Knowledge. The intrusion example is an example of
getting into or out of somewhere, not rewiring alarm
systems or confounding surveillance camera feeds.
• Jumping [Strength, or Strength + Athletics for a
running jump]: Typically, jump rolls are made versus a
difficulty of 3. Each success on a jump roll launches your
character two feet/50 cm vertically or three feet/one meter horizontally. To jump successfully, a character must
clear more distance than the distance between her and
her destination. On a failure, the character fails to clear
the required distance, but the player may make a Dexterity + Athletics roll (typically versus difficulty 6) to allow
the character to grab onto a ledge or other safety as she
falls. On a botch, your character may slip on the precipice, leap right into a wall, or fall to her doom.
If the player makes a Perception + Athletics roll (difficulty 6, three successes required) before attempting a
jump, he may gauge exactly how many successes are
needed to make the leap.
• Lifting/Breaking [Strength]: The following chart
provides the minimum Strength needed to deadlift
various weights or break objects without a die roll.
Characters of lower Strength may roll to affect heavier
weights than their Strength ratings allow for. The roll
is made not with Strength, but with Willpower, and is
difficulty 9. Each success advances the character by one
level on the chart.

Characters can work together to lift an object. This
is a “teamwork roll” for which the individual players
roll separately and combine any resulting successes.
Lifting is all or nothing — if you fail the roll, nothing
happens. At the Storyteller’s discretion, your character’s effective Strength may be raised if all she wants
to do is drag something a short distance instead of pick
it up. On a botch, your character may pull a muscle or
drop the object on her own foot.
• Opening/Closing [Strength]: Opening a door with
brute force calls for a Strength roll (difficulty 6 to 8,
depending on the material of the door). A standard interior door requires only one success to bash open or
slam shut. A reinforced door generally takes five successes. A vault door might take 10 or more successes.
These successes may be handled as an extended action.
While teamwork is possible (and recommended), a
door can still be forced open through a single individual’s repeated hammering. A botch causes a health level
of lethal damage to your character’s shoulder.
Certain doors (metal vault doors and the like) may
require a Strength minimum just to make an attempt.
• Pursuit [Dexterity + Athletics/Drive]: Vampires
must often pursue their terrified prey, and sometimes
they themselves must flee. Generally, pursuit can be
resolved automatically by using the formulas for calculating movement (p. 258); if one party is clearly faster

than another, the faster party catches or evades the
slower party eventually. However, dramatic situations
may occur if two characters are of equal or nearly equal
speeds, or if one character is slower but might lose the
faster character or make it to safety before she catches
him. In these cases, use the system below.
Basic pursuit is an extended action. The target starts
with a number of free extra successes based on his distance from the pursuer. This breaks down as follows:
on foot, one for every two yards/meters ahead of pursuers; in vehicles, one for every 10 yards/meters ahead of
pursuers. For chases involving vampires and mortals,
remember that mortals tire, but the undead do not.
The target and pursuers make the appropriate roll
(depending on the type of pursuit) each turn, adding
new successes to any successes rolled in previous turns.
When the pursuer accumulates more total successes
than the target has, she catches up and may take further actions to stop the chase. As the target accumulates successes, he gains distance from his pursuers and
may use that lead to lose his opponents. Each success
that the quarry accumulates beyond the pursuer’s total
acts as a +1 difficulty to any Perception roll a pursuer
must make to remain on the target’s tail. The Storyteller may call for the pursuer to make a Perception roll
at any time (though not more than once each turn).
If the pursuer fails this roll, her target is considered to

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

261

have slipped away (into the crowd, into a side street).
On a botch, the pursuer loses her quarry immediately.
If the quarry botches, he stumbles or ends up at a dead
end.

Vampires caught in shallow water during the day will
take damage from sunlight (assume that a submerged
vampire has protection equivalent to being under
cloud cover).

• Shadowing [Dexterity + Stealth/Drive]: Shadowing someone requires that your character keep tabs on
the target without necessarily catching her — without
being noticed. At the Storyteller’s discretion, or if the
target suspects she’s being pursued, the target’s player
can roll Perception + Alertness whenever she has a
chance to spot her tail (the Storyteller decides when
such an opportunity arises). The pursuer’s player opposes this with a Dexterity + Stealth roll (or Dexterity
+ Drive, if the shadower is in a vehicle). The difficulty
for both rolls is typically 6, but can be modified by conditions (heavy crowds, empty streets, etc.). The target
must score at least one more success than her shadow
does to spot the tail; if she does, she may act accordingly.

• Throwing [Dexterity + Athletics]: Objects (Molotov cocktails, knives, beer bottles) with a mass of two
pounds/one kilogram or less can be thrown a distance
of Strength x 5 yards/meters. For every additional two
pounds/one kilogram of weight that an object has, this
distance decreases by five yards/meters (particularly
heavy objects don’t go very far). As long as the object’s mass doesn’t reduce throwing distance to zero,
your character can pick up and throw it. If an object
can be lifted, but its mass reduces throwing distance
to zero, the object can be hurled aside at best — about
one yard or meter of distance. Obviously, if an object
can’t be lifted, it can’t be thrown at all (refer instead to
“Lifting/Breaking,” p. 260).

Shadowers who have trained together can combine
their separate rolls into one success total.
• Sneaking [Dexterity + Stealth]: A sneaking
character uses Dexterity + Stealth as a resisted action
against Perception + Alertness rolls from anyone able
to detect her passing. The difficulty of both rolls is typically 6. Unless observers score more successes than the
sneaking character does, she passes undetected. Noise,
unsecured gear, lack of cover, or large groups of observers can increase Stealth difficulty. Security devices,
scanners, or superior vantage points may add dice to
Perception + Alertness rolls. On a botch, the character
stumbles into one of the people she’s avoiding, accidentally walks into the open, or performs some other
act that compromises her.
Note that vampires using the Obfuscate Discipline
(p. 184) may not have to make rolls at all.
• Swimming [Stamina + Athletics]: Assuming your
character can swim at all (being able to do so requires
one dot of Athletics), long-distance or long-duration
swimming requires successful swimming rolls versus a
difficulty determined by water conditions. After all,
although vampires can’t drown, they are corpses and
thus have little buoyancy. The first roll is necessary
only after the first hour of sustained activity, and only
one success is needed. If a roll fails, the character loses
ground — perhaps pulled out of her way by a current.
If a roll botches, she starts to sink, or might even be hit
by a heedless motorboat.

262

The Storyteller may reduce throwing distances for
particularly unwieldy objects or increase them for aerodynamic ones. Throwing an object with any degree of
accuracy requires a Dexterity + Athletics roll versus difficulty 6 (to half maximum range) or 7 (half maximum
to maximum range). This difficulty can be adjusted for
wind conditions and other variables at the Storyteller’s
discretion. On a botch, your character may drop the
object or strike a companion with it, or she might toss
something that wasn’t what she intended to throw, after all….

Mental Feats
These systems cover tasks involving the three Mental Attributes (Perception, Intelligence, and Wits), as
well as tasks using the Virtues, Humanity and Paths,
and Willpower. Mental tests can provide you with information about things your character knows but you,
the player, don’t. Still, you should depend on your creativity when solving problems — not on dice rolls.
• Awakening [Perception, Humanity/Path]: Vampires are nocturnal creatures and find it difficult to
awaken during the day. A vampire disturbed in his haven while the sun is in the sky may roll Perception (+
Auspex rating, if the vampire has it) versus difficulty
8 to notice the disturbance. Upon stirring, the vampire must make a Humanity or Path roll (difficulty 8).
Each success allows the vampire to act for one turn.
Five successes mean the vampire is completely awake
for the entire scene. Failure indicates the vampire slips
back into slumber, but may make the Perception roll

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

to reawaken if circumstances allow. A botch means the
vampire falls into deep sleep and will not awaken until
sundown.
While active during the day, the vampire may have
no more dice in any dice pool than his Humanity or
Path rating.
• Creation [variable]: Some vampires were artists,
musicians, writers, or other creative types in life. Others spend centuries trying to rekindle the spark of passion that undeath has taken from them. Certainly, the
society of the Damned has gazed upon many wondrous
(and horrific) works of art never seen by human eyes.
When trying to create something, a variety of rolls
can be used, depending on what it is the character
wishes to create. Perception (to come up with a subject worthy of expression) + Expression or Crafts (to
capture the feeling in an artistic medium) is a common
roll. In all cases, the player must decide the general parameters of what she wants her character to create — a
haiku about roses, a portrait of the Prince, an epigram
for the Archbishop’s sermon, etc.
The difficulty is variable, depending on the nature
of the creation (it’s easier to write a limerick than a
Petrarchan sonnet). The number of successes governs

the quality of the creation: With one success, the character creates a mediocre, uninspired, but not terrible
work, while with five successes the character creates
a literary or artistic masterpiece. Some works (novels,
large sculptures, vast murals) might require extended
success rolls. On a botch, the character creates what
she knows is the greatest work ever known to Kindred
or kine (while everyone else who sees it immediately
realizes what crap it actually is), or perhaps she embarrasses a patron, leaves out a pivotal figure, or goes off
on a tangent that neglects her original intent and is
thus unsuitable for her original purposes.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, a vampire who creates
a particularly inspired masterwork might be eligible for a
rise in Humanity or certain Paths, via experience points.
Likewise, a creative epiphany may be suitable for working through and curing a derangement (see p. 290).
• Computer Use [Intelligence/Wits + Computer]:
Most business and political transactions involve the
use of computers, which can give neonates a surprising
advantage in the Jyhad. In times when almost everyone
carries some sort of computer, the edge truly belongs to
those who can collect information as it is needed, as
well as quickly disseminating it. Haughty elders may

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

263

sneer at fledglings hunched over their smartphones instead of dispensing bon mots at Elysium, but if those
fledglings are using social media to coordinate an ambush on one of those hated elders once court comes to
a close, it’s undeniable that a little computer savvy can
even the odds that formerly favored the elders greatly.
Generally, Computer rolls are those that collect, display, or transfer information. Creating physical results
(like remotely turning off a security system or activating a restricted elevator) is usually the purview of the
Technology Knowledge. Of course, a single end result
can sometimes be achieved by multiple methods.
Using computers typically falls under two distinct
types of behavior.
The first type is comparatively benign or personal use.
Tasks such as performing research, writing software,
building a website, or participating in social networks
can involve Computer in their dice pools if using the
computer is the primary component of the action. For
example, performing search-engine research on a topic
might invoke an Intelligence + Computers roll to yield
facts, while a botch would turn up completely misleading information. In most cases, these won’t see much
stressful dice-pool action unless performed in bizarre
circumstances or with devices the user isn’t familiar
with. Additionally, what constitutes a computer can
vary wildly, from a netbook in a cafe to a smartphone
on the go to a traditional desktop machine.
Storytellers, life in a modern world inherently involves a certain quantity of computer use, so ask if it’s
really necessary to have a player roll to check his email
unless there are interesting dramatic outcomes of failure. Note, too, that in some cases, even though the
character is using a computer, the Computer Knowledge might not be the relevant Ability. For example, a
player trying to join an online community of vampire
hunters is probably using Wits + Subterfuge or Charisma + Expression, even though she’s at a keyboard.
The second type of behavior is generally referred to as
“hacking.” In game terms, hacking is subverting computer security to obtain information that someone has
made secure in order to control that information. Even
more broadly, hacking can also describe turning a device or computer program against or beyond its original
intent. Often, the result of this latter type of hacking is
also to gain information, but in some cases, the hacker
seeks to create a specific result. He might display a message on a screen that wouldn’t normally receive it or
create a nonexistent mortgage on the Ventrue Primo-

264

gen’s haven and marking it as in foreclosure. Resolve
these situations in the same way as information-driven
hacking, for the sake of simplicity.
A would-be hacker’s player rolls Intelligence or Wits
+ Computer versus a variable difficulty (6 for standard
systems, up to 9 for complicated situations like corporate server clusters, old government mainframes, and
the like). Successes indicate the number of dice (up
to the normal dice pool) that can be rolled to interact
with the system once it’s been breached.
Actively blocking a hacker is a resisted action; the
opponent with the most successes wins. On a botch,
the character may alert security to her presence or
even reveal her identity to the system she’s trying to
breach.
Remember, too, that hacking is almost always an extended action. Storytellers, set the number of successes
for extended actions via hacking high — it’s all too
tempting for players to use this as the “do anything I
want because, you know, computers” Ability. It should
take far more than a single success to evict a Kindred
from her haven or to delete one’s own birth records,
for example.
• Investigation [Perception + Investigation]: Any
search for clues, evidence, or hidden contraband involves Investigation. The Storyteller may add to the
difficulty of investigations involving obscure clues or
particularly well-concealed objects. One success reveals basic details, while multiple successes provide
detailed information and may even allow deductions
based on physical evidence. On a botch, obvious clues
are missed or even destroyed accidentally.
• Repair [Dexterity/Perception + Crafts]: Depending on the precise specialty, the Crafts Skill allows for
repairs of everything from pottery to automobile engines (though not computers). Before repairing a device that’s on the fritz, your character must identify its
problems (accomplished as a standard research roll; see
below). Then, if repair is required, the Storyteller sets
the difficulty of the repair roll. This difficulty depends
on the problem’s severity, whether the proper tools or
any replacement parts are on hand, and if adverse conditions exist. An inspired research roll may offset these
factors somewhat. A simple tire change is difficulty 4,
while rebuilding an entire engine might be difficulty
9. Basic repairs take at least a few turns to complete.
More complex repairs are extended actions that last
10 minutes for each success needed. On a botch, your
character may simply waste time and a new part, or
may make the problem worse.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

• Research [Intelligence + Academics/Occult/Science]: Research is performed when searching computer
databases for historical facts, when looking for obscure
references in ancient documents, or when trying to
learn the true name of a Methuselah. In all cases, the
number of successes achieved determines the amount
of information discovered; one success gives you at
least basic information, while extra successes provide
more details. The Storyteller may assign a high difficulty for particularly obscure data. On a botch, your
character may not find anything at all or may uncover
completely erroneous information.

lation when perpetrating a scam or with Perception
when trying to detect one (a scam can range from impersonating the authorities to using forged papers). All
parties involved, whether detecting the lie or telling it,
make an appropriate roll (typically difficulty 7). The
scam’s “marks” must roll higher than the perpetrator to
detect any deception. False credentials and other convincing props may add to the difficulty of uncovering
the dupe, while teamwork may help reveal the scam.
Hacking and/or intrusion rolls may be called for to pull
off an inspired scam successfully. On a botch, the entire plan falls apart.

• Tracking [Perception + Survival]: Unlike shadowing, tracking requires you to follow physical evidence to find a target. Discovering footprints, broken
twigs, blood trails, or other physical signs leads the
tracker right to the subject. Following such a trail is
a standard action; multiple successes provide extra information (subject’s rate of speed, estimated weight,
number of people followed). The quarry can cover her
tracks through a successful Wits + Survival roll. Each
success on this roll adds one to the difficulty of tracking her. Abnormal weather, poor tracking conditions
(city streets, Elysium), and a shortage of time also add
to tracking difficulty. On a botch, your character not
only loses the trail, but destroys the quarry’s signs of
passage.

• Fast-Talk [Manipulation + Subterfuge]: When
there’s no time for subtlety, baffle them with nonsense.
The target can be overwhelmed with a rapid succession
of almost-believable half-truths. Hopefully, the subject
believes anything she hears just to get away from the
babble — or becomes so annoyed that she ignores your
character completely. This is a resisted action — your
character’s Manipulation + Subterfuge against the target’s Willpower. The difficulty of both rolls is typically
6, and whoever scores more successes wins. On a tie,
more babbling is needed. On a botch, your character
goes too far, angering the target and rambling without
effect.

Social Feats
These systems cover tasks involving the three Social
Attributes (Charisma, Manipulation, and Appearance). Roleplaying usually supersedes any Social skill
roll, for better or worse. Storytellers may ignore the Social systems when a player exhibits particularly good,
or excruciatingly bad, roleplaying.
• Carousing [Charisma + Empathy]: You influence
others (particularly potential vessels) to relax and have
fun. This might include showing a potential ally a good
time, loosening an informant’s tongue, or making instant drinking buddies who come to your aid when a
brawl starts. The difficulty is typically 6 (most people
can be persuaded to loosen up, regardless of intellect
or will), though it might be higher in the case of large
(or surly) groups. Certain Natures (Bon Vivant, Curmudgeon) can also influence the roll’s difficulty. On a
botch, your character comes off as an obnoxious boor,
or people begin to question why your character hasn’t
touched her own food and drink.…
• Credibility [Manipulation/Perception + Subterfuge]: The Subterfuge Talent is used with Manipu-

• Interrogation [Manipulation + Empathy/Intimidation]: Anyone can ask questions. With interrogation, you ask questions and have leverage. Interrogating someone peacefully (Manipulation + Empathy)
involves asking strategic questions designed to reveal
specific facts. This method is a resisted action between
your character’s Manipulation + Empathy and the
subject’s Willpower. Both actions are typically made
against a difficulty of 6. Rolls are made at key points
during questioning, probably every few minutes or at
the end of an interrogation session.
Violent interrogation (Manipulation + Intimidation)
involves torturing the victim’s mind and/or body until
she reveals what she knows. This is a resisted action
between your character’s Manipulation + Intimidation
and the target’s Stamina + 3 or Willpower (whichever
is higher). Rolls are made every minute or turn, depending on the type of torture used. The subject loses
a health level for every turn of physical torture, or one
temporary Willpower point per turn of mental torture.
The combined effect of physical and mental torture
has devastating results. A botched roll can destroy the
subject’s body or mind.
Two or more interrogators can work together, combining successes; this works even if one interrogator

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

265

is using Empathy while another is using Intimidation
(the classic “good cop/bad cop” ploy).
Whatever the interrogation method used, if you roll
more successes in the resisted action, the target divulges additional information for each extra success rolled.
If your extra successes exceed the victim’s permanent
Willpower rating, she folds completely and reveals everything she knows. The extent and relevance of shared
information are up to the Storyteller (details are often
skewed to reflect what the subject knows or by what
she thinks her interrogator wants to hear).
• Intimidation [Strength/Manipulation + Intimidation]: Intimidation has two effects. Intimidation’s passive effect doesn’t involve a roll; it simply gives your
character plenty of space — whether on a bus or in a
bar. The higher your Intimidation rating, the wider the
berth that others give him.
Intimidation’s active application works through subtlety or outright threat. Subtlety is based on a perceived
threat (losing one’s job, being arrested, pain and agony
later in life). Roll Manipulation + Intimidation in a resisted action against the subject’s Willpower (difficulty
6 for both rolls); the target must get more successes or
be effectively cowed.
The blatant form of intimidation involves direct
physical threat. In this case, you may roll Strength
+ Intimidation in a resisted roll (difficulty 6) against
either the subject’s Willpower or her Strength + Intimidation (whichever is higher). On a botch, your
character looks patently ridiculous and doesn’t impress
anyone in attendance for the rest of the scene.
• Oration [Charisma + Leadership]: From a general’s rousing speeches to a politician’s slick double-talk,
the capacity to sway the masses creates and destroys
empires. When your character speaks to an audience,
from a small board meeting to a large crowd, roll Charisma + Leadership. Difficulty is typically 6; the Storyteller may increase the difficulty for a huge, cynical,
dispassionate, or openly hostile audience. Oration is
hit or miss — your character either succeeds or fails.
On a botch, your character may damage her reputation
or even be assaulted by the audience.
If the character has time to prepare a speech beforehand, the Storyteller may roll the character’s Intelligence + Expression (difficulty 7). Success on this roll
reduces the subsequent Charisma + Leadership difficulty by one. Failure has no effect, while a botch actually increases the Charisma + Leadership difficulty (the
character inserts a gaffe into the speech).

266

• Performance [Charisma + Performance]: Vampires are certainly egotistical creatures, and some among
their number are actors, poets, musicians, or other sorts
of entertainers. When a character performs live before
an audience, roll Charisma + Performance (difficulty
7). As with oration, the audience’s mood can increase
the difficulty, as can the performance’s complexity.
One success indicates an enjoyable, if uninspired, effort, while additional successes make the performance
a truly memorable event to even the surliest crowd. On
a botch, your character forgets lines, hits the wrong
chord, or otherwise flubs.
• Seduction [variable]: Vampires are master seducers, for their very sustenance often depends on coaxing
potential prey into an intimate liaison. The particular
situation and style of the seduction determine which
Ability is used.
Seduction is an involved process involving several
different rolls and Abilities:
• First roll (approach/opening remarks): The player
rolls Appearance + Subterfuge versus a difficulty equal
to the subject’s Wits + 3. Each success beyond the first
adds one die to the vampire’s dice pool for the second
roll. A failure means the subject expresses his disinterest; a botch means the subject might grow disgusted or
angry.
• Second roll (witty repartee): The player rolls Wits
+ Subterfuge versus a difficulty equal to the subject’s
Intelligence + 3. Again, each success beyond the initial one adds one die to the dice pool for the final roll.
If the roll fails, the subject breaks off the contact, but
might prove receptive at a later date (after all, the first
impression was good).
• Third roll (suggestive/intimate conversation): The
player rolls Charisma + Empathy versus a difficulty of
the subject’s Perception + 3. If the third roll succeeds,
the subject is enamored with the character and agrees
to accompany her to a private spot. What happens
next is best handled with roleplaying.
On a botch, the vampire likely ends up with a drink
in her face.

Spending Willpower
Willpower is one of the most active and important
Traits in Vampire. Because there are so many ways to
expend, regain, and use Willpower, it fluctuates more
than any other Trait (besides blood pool) in the game.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Willpower is a very versatile Trait, so make sure you
understand how to use it.
• A player may spend one of her character’s Willpower points to gain an automatic success on a single
action. Only one point of Willpower may be used in
a single turn in this manner, but the success is guaranteed and may not be canceled, even by botches. By
using Willpower in this way, it is possible to succeed at
a given action simply by concentrating. For extended
rolls, these extra successes may make the critical difference between accomplishment and failure.
Note: You must declare that you are spending a
Willpower point before you make an actual roll for
a character’s action; you can’t retroactively cancel a
botch by spending a Willpower point at the last minute. Also, the Storyteller may declare that a Willpower
point may not be spent on a given action (such as attacking in combat).
• Sometimes, the Storyteller may rule that a character automatically takes some action based on instinct
or urge — for example, stepping back from a chasm or
leaping away from a patch of sunlight filtering through
a window. The Storyteller may allow a player to spend
a Willpower point and avoid taking this reactive maneuver. It should be noted that the impulse may return at the Storyteller’s discretion; a player may need
to spend multiple Willpower points over the course of
a few turns to stay on task. Sometimes the urge may be
overcome by the force of the character’s will; at other
times, the character has no choice but to follow his instinct (i.e., the character runs out of Willpower points
or no longer wishes to expend them).
• A Willpower point may be spent to prevent a derangement from manifesting, with the Storyteller’s
permission. Eventually, if enough Willpower points are
spent (as determined by the Storyteller), the derangement may be overcome and eliminated, as enough
denial of the derangement remedies the aberration.
Malkavians may never overcome their initial derangement, though Willpower may be spent to deny it for a
short period of time.
• By spending a Willpower point, wound penalties
can be ignored for one turn. This allows a character to
override pain and injury in order to take one last-ditch
action. However, an incapacitated or torpored character may not spend Willpower in this manner.

Regaining Willpower
Willpower may be recovered as well as spent. The
following situations earn the character back a point

or more of Willpower, though a character’s Willpower pool may never exceed her Willpower rating. The
only way to increase a character’s Willpower rating is
through experience-point expenditure.
Generally, a character’s Willpower pool may be replenished whenever the character fulfills a goal or has
an opportunity to restore her self-confidence. Ultimately, specific instances of Willpower restoration are
up to the Storyteller. For this reason, Storytellers are
advised to be prudent in allowing characters to regain
Willpower; it is a powerful and versatile Trait, and permitting players to rely on it too much strips much of
the challenge from a story.
• Characters’ Willpower pools replenish fully at the
end of a given story (and that’s story, not session). The
Storyteller may restrict this by requiring that the characters achieve (or partially achieve) a goal or otherwise
boost their self-esteem. For example, if the characters
didn’t destroy a powerful and corrupt elder but did
manage to obstruct his immediate plans, allow them to
replenish their Willpower pools.
• (Storyteller’s Option) Characters regain one Willpower point each night when they first rise. This is
easy on the bookkeeping, and allows a steady stream
of Willpower replenishment (not to mention the fact
that players are already writing on that part of the
character sheet when they mark off their nightly blood
consumption).
• (Storyteller’s Option) If a character attains some
extraordinary goal or fulfills an outstanding objective,
the Storyteller may reward her with a point of Willpower. For example, if a character manages to deter
a team of vampire-hunters from her sire’s haven, the
Storyteller may award a Willpower point to that character.
• (Storyteller’s Option) If a character behaves in a
manner that fulfills her Nature Archetype, the Storyteller may reward the character with one to three Willpower points (as stated in the Archetype descriptions).
For example, if a Rebel character rabidly opposes a
powerful elder, and that elder is later revealed to be
a Sabbat spy, that character may be given a point of
Willpower.
Storytellers are encouraged to create their own systems or modify our systems to suit their troupe’s style
of play. Indeed, the manner in which a Storyteller allows, or refuses to allow, Willpower replenishment can
determine the overall mood of the chronicle.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

267

Using Blood Pool
Vampires must subtract one blood point from their
blood pools every night, whether they rise for the evening or not, as the unnatural magics animating their
dead bodies consume the vitae they have taken from
their prey. Blood points may also be spent in a variety
of ways, and may be replenished only by consuming
blood.
Blood pool also affects Self-Control (or Instinct)
rolls, which come into play when a character’s frenzy
becomes imminent. A player may never roll more dice
for a Self-Control or Instinct roll than the character
has blood pool. For example, if a character has only
two blood points left, her player may roll only two dice
for a Self-Control roll, even if the character’s SelfControl rating is 4. Voracious vampires just don’t fight
the Beast very well.

Spending Blood Pool
As previously mentioned, every vampire expends
one blood point each night when she awakens, whether or not she actually goes out and about. Characters
may also use blood points in a variety of other ways.
A vampire may spend only a certain number of blood
points per turn; this number is dependent on the vampire’s Generation. See the Generation chart (p. 270)
to determine this number.
• A vampire may spend one blood point to heal
one normal (bashing or lethal) health level of damage. Characters must be resting and relatively inactive
for this healing to take place, though this recovery is
rapid: One blood point per turn may be spent to heal
one health level, though vampires of lower Generations may heal as many health levels per turn as they
can spend blood points.
Note that blood expenditure is the only way that
vampires can heal wounds. Just as their immortality
prevents the Kindred from aging and dying naturally,
so it also inhibits the recuperative processes natural to
a living body.
• A player may spend one blood point to increase a
single Physical Attribute (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina) by one dot for the duration of the scene. The player
must announce at the beginning of the turn that he is
doing this. A player may spend as many blood points on
increasing Physical Attributes as the vampire may use
in a turn (based upon Generation), but may only freely
increase these Traits up to one higher than their gen-

268

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

erational maximum (i.e., a Tenth-Generation vampire
may increase Traits to a maximum of 6). With effort, a
character may increase a Physical Attribute to above
this limit, but each dot above the limit lasts for only
three turns after the character stops spending blood.
This enables vampires to perform truly amazing physical feats, such as throwing cars, moving preternaturally
quickly, and withstanding blows that would fell trees.
Note: No character may increase Physical Attributes
above 10.
• A vampire may give a number of blood points to
another Kindred, thereby enabling the recipient to use
the blood as if it were her own. This is often a grisly
prospect, as the “donor” must open his own vein and
physically deliver the blood to the needy Kindred. Of
course, if a vampire is ever in a situation in which she
needs blood, she’s likely all out of it herself, and may
frenzy and take too much from the donor. Blood gifts
should be given with care.
If a vampire (or mortal) partakes of another Kindred’s blood three times, she becomes bound to that
vampire through the mystical properties of vitae. This
is known as the blood bond. For more on blood bonds,
see p. 286.
• A vampire may gift a mortal or animal with a dose
of his vitae, allowing the mortal in question to inject or
ingest it. For so long as the mortal retains the Kindred
vitae in her system, she is considered a ghoul (see the
Appendix, p. 496, for more on ghouls).
• Though most vampires (with the exception of
Nosferatu) appear much as they did in life, they still
display certain corpselike features; for example, their
skin is unnaturally cold and grows more ashen with
age, and they do not breathe. By spending a variable
number of blood points, a vampire may will himself
to appear more human for a scene: flushing his skin,
drawing breath, even becoming capable of engaging in
sexual intercourse (this last, while helpful in certain
types of feeding, in no way means that the vampire
may inseminate a mortal or become pregnant; a corpse
is still a corpse, after all). Performing these actions for
a scene requires an expenditure of blood points equal
to (8 minus Humanity); thus, Kindred with Humanity
ratings of 8 or higher may accomplish these feats automatically, while vampires with low Humanity find the
process exceedingly arduous.
Only vampires with Humanity may use blood in this
manner; vampires on a Path have forsaken their human sides entirely.

• Blood may be spent to fuel certain vampiric Disciplines. Consult Chapter Four or Chapter Ten to see
which individual powers require blood expenditure.

Earning Blood Pool
Vampires replenish blood pool by taking it from others. “Others” need not be human, though a vampire
who is too squeamish to take sustenance from the kine
is often ridiculed by his peers — vampires are predators, after all, no matter how unnatural.
Drinking blood is a risky proposition. As vampires
gorge on the vitae of their victims, there is always the
chance that they may take too much. Unhygienic
vampires may communicate disease by exposing a vessel to bacteria and viruses carried in other blood that
still stains their fangs. A vampire may take only 20 percent of a vessel’s blood (2 blood points for a normal
human) and leave it relatively safe. Taking half of a
vessel’s blood necessitates hospitalization for that vessel. Taking all a vessel’s blood will kill it.
A vampire may take up to three blood points from a
given vessel in a turn. The shorter the turn, the more
forcefully the Kindred steals the vitae. It is generally
impossible to take more than three blood points from a
vessel in three seconds (the shortest a turn gets), though
some Nosferatu with hideously distended mouths are
able to take more through sheer surface area bleed.
Most vampires drink their victim’s blood slowly, so as
to savor the luscious fluid and draw as much pleasure as
possible out of the experience.
Once the Kindred breaks her vessel’s skin with her
fangs, that vessel no longer resists the vampire (if he
did in the first place). Indeed, the ecstasy caused by
the vampire’s bite is called the Kiss, and it engenders
as much exquisite, subtly painful pleasure in vampires
as it does in mortals. Exceptionally strong-willed mortals (9+ Willpower) may continue to resist, but even
these vessels eventually succumb to the pleasure. Some
Kindred and kine even develop lusts for the Kiss and
actively seek out those who will drink their blood.
Note: While Kindred find the Kiss pleasurable, they
may resist it more readily than mortals can. Any Kindred, regardless of Willpower, may make a Self-Control/Instincts roll (difficulty 8) to avoid succumbing
to the Kiss. This enables vampiric victims of diablerie
(p. 293) to have a chance at fighting back.
Wounded characters typically have less blood than
healthy characters. Assume that a normal-sized human
has one fewer blood point in his system for each health
level of damage he currently suffers. Mortals regain one

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

269

blood point per day (unless, of course, they are infused
with vitae from some other source). Vampires do not
lose blood points to wounds in this manner, though
they often spend blood to heal wounds they have suffered.
The blood of animals is not as nourishing as the blood
of humans. Though an animal may physically have a
greater volume of blood than a man, vampires draw less
sustenance from it. Hence, animals have fewer blood
points, even if they have more blood.
Old blood is never as nourishing as fresh blood. In
fact, many vampires refuse to drink old blood, whether
it comes from human corpses, blood banks, or a vampire’s private reserve. However, the blood of other vampires, particularly elders, is quite potent. When drinking from elder vampires, each blood point taken may
be so concentrated that it is actually worth two — or
more! — normal blood points in use. Thus it is possible
to obtain a vast amount of blood points by partaking of

elder blood, though such prized vitae is rarely available
to neonates or even ancillae. Essentially, elders have
greater blood pools not because they are bodily larger
than younger vampires, but because the blood they ingest is more concentrated in their ancient veins. Werewolf blood is similarly potent.

Max Trait Rating: This indicates the highest permanent Trait rating (excluding Humanity/Path ratings and Willpower ratings) a vampire of the given Generation can have. This is especially important
with regard to Disciplines and Attributes.
Blood Pool Max: The maximum number of blood points a vampire may keep in her system. Remember that elder vampires concentrate their blood — while the volume of blood in their bodies is no greater
than any other vampire’s, each pint of blood is worth more than one point.
Blood Points/Turn: This indicates how many blood points a vampire can spend in a single turn.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Combat Systems
Combat in Vampire attempts to capture the drama
of violent conflict without downplaying its grim reality.
Every effort has been made to create a system has the
feeling of dynamic, vicious combat while still leaving
room for the unique (and often spectacular) elements
that vampires bring to it.
The Storyteller should be flexible when arbitrating
combat situations; no rules can fully reflect the variety of situations encountered in warfare. If these systems slow the game or cause bickering, don’t use them.
Combat systems are meant to add depth to the game,
not create conflict between the players and the Storyteller.

Types of Combat
There are two types of combat, each involving the
same basic system with minor differences:
• Close Combat: This covers unarmed combat
(Dexterity + Brawl) and melee (Dexterity + Melee).
Unarmed combat can involve a down-and-dirty bar
brawl or an honorable test of skill. Opponents must be
within touching distance (one yard/meter) to engage
in unarmed combat. Melee involves handheld weapons, from broken bottles to swords. Opponents must
be within two yards/meters of each other to engage in
melee.
• Ranged Combat: Armed combat using projectile
weapons — pistols, rifles, shotguns, etc. Opponents
must normally be within sight (and weapon range) of
each other to engage in a firefight.

Combat Turns
In combat, many things happen at virtually the same
time. Since this can make things a bit sticky in a game,
combat is divided into a series of three-second turns.
Each combat turn has three stages — Initiative, Attack, and Resolution — to make it easier to keep track
of things.

Stage One: Initiative
This stage organizes the turn and is when you declare
your character’s action. Various actions are possible
— anything from leaping behind a wall to shouting a
warning. You must declare what your character does,
in as much detail as the Storyteller requires.
Everyone, player and Storyteller character alike, rolls
one die and adds it to their initiative rating (Dexterity +

Describing the Scene
Before each turn, the Storyteller should
describe the scene from each character’s
perspective. Sometimes this will be a wrap-up
of the last turn, making what occurred clear
to all players. This constant description is essential to avoid confusion.
This is the Storyteller’s chance to organize
and arrange events so that all goes smoothly
when the players interact with the environment she has created. The Storyteller should
make her descriptions as interesting as possible, leaving open all sorts of possibilities for
characters’ actions.

Wits); the character with the highest result acts first,
with the remaining characters acting in decreasing order of result. (Storytellers looking for a slightly faster
or more predictable system can choose to use Dexterity + Wits + 6 for each character’s initiative, forgoing the die roll.) If two characters get the same total,
the one with the higher initiative rating goes first. If
initiative ratings are also the same, the two characters
act simultaneously. Wound penalties subtract directly
from a character’s initiative rating, while Celerity dots
that aren’t being used for extra actions add to it (see
Celerity, p. 142).
Although you declare your character’s action now
(including stating that your character delays her action to see what someone else does), you wait until the attack stage to implement that action. At this
time, you must also state if any multiple actions will
be performed, if Disciplines will be activated, and/or if
Willpower points will be spent. Characters declare in
reverse order of initiative, thus giving faster characters
the opportunity to react to slower characters’ actions.
All of your character’s actions are staged at her rank
in the order of initiative. There are three exceptions to
this rule: The first is if your character delays her action,
in which case her maneuvers happen when she finally
takes action. Your character may act at any time after
her designated order in the initiative, even to interrupt another, slower character’s action. If two charac-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

271

ters both delay their actions, and both finally act at the
same time, the one with the higher initiative rating for
the turn acts first.
The second breach of the initiative order occurs in
the case of a defensive action (see “Aborting Actions”
and “Defensive Maneuvers,” both on p. 274), which
your character may perform at any time as long as she
has an action left.
Finally, all additional actions that turn (including
actions gained through Celerity) occur at the end of
the turn. If two or more characters take multiple actions, the actions occur in order of initiative rating. An
exception is made for defensive multiple actions, such
as multiple dodges, which happen when they need to
happen in order to avert attack.

Stage Two: Attack
Attacks are the meat of the combat turn. An action’s
success or failure and potential impact on the target are
determined at this stage. You use a certain Attribute/
Ability combination depending on the type of combat
in which your character is engaged:
• Close Combat: Use Dexterity + Brawl (unarmed)
or Dexterity + Melee (armed).
• Ranged Combat: Use Dexterity + Firearms (guns)
or Dexterity + Athletics (thrown weapons).
Remember, if your character doesn’t have points in
the necessary Ability, simply default to the Attribute
on which it’s based (in most cases, Dexterity).
In ranged combat, your weapon may modify your dice
pool or difficulty (due to rate of fire, a targeting scope,
etc.); check the weapon’s statistics for details.
Most attacks are made versus difficulty 6. This can be
adjusted for situational modifiers (long range, cramped
quarters), but the default attack roll is versus 6. If you
get no successes, the character fails her attack and inflicts no damage. If you botch, not only does the attack
fail, but something nasty happens: The weapon jams or
explodes, the blade breaks, an ally is hit, and so on.

Stage Three: Resolution
During this stage, you determine the damage inflicted
by your character’s attack, and the Storyteller describes
what occurs in the turn. Resolution is a mixture of
game and story; it’s more interesting for players to hear
“Your claws rip through his bowels; he screams in pain,
dropping his gun as he clutches his bloody abdomen”
than simply “Uh, he loses four health levels.” Attack
and damage rolls are merely ways of describing what

272

happens in the story, and it’s important to maintain
the narrative of combat even as you make the die roll.
Normally, additional successes gained on a Trait roll
simply mean that you do exceptionally well. In combat, each extra success you get on an attack roll equals
an additional die you add automatically to your damage dice pool. This creates cinematic and often fatal
combat.

Damage Types
All attacks have specific damage ratings, indicating the number of dice to roll for the attack’s damage
(called the damage dice pool). Some damage dice pools
are based on the attacker’s Strength, while others are
based on the weapon used. Damage dice rolls are made
versus difficulty 6. Each success on the damage roll inflicts one health level of damage on the target. However, the damage applied may be one of three types:
• Bashing: Bashing damage comprises punches and
other blunt trauma that are less likely to kill a victim
(especially a vampire) instantly. All characters use
their full Stamina ratings to resist bashing effects, and
the damage heals fairly quickly. Bashing damage is applied to the Health boxes on your character sheet with
a “/.”
• Lethal: Attacks meant to cause immediate and fatal injury to the target. Mortals may not use Stamina to
resist lethal effects, and the damage takes quite a while
to heal. Vampires may resist lethal damage with their
Stamina. Lethal damage is applied to the Health boxes
on your vampire’s character sheet with a “X.”
• Aggravated: Certain types of attacks are deadly
even to the undead. Fire, sunlight, and the teeth and
claws of vampires, werewolves, and other supernatural
beings are considered aggravated damage. Aggravated
damage cannot be soaked except with Fortitude, and it
takes quite a while to heal. Aggravated damage is applied to the Health boxes on your character sheet with
an asterisk (“*”).
Damage dice pools can never be reduced to lower
than one die; any attack that strikes its target has at
least a small chance of inflicting damage before a soak
roll is made. Moreover, damage effect rolls cannot
botch; a botched roll simply means the attack glances
harmlessly off the target. Specifics on applying damage
effects are described on pp. 284-285.

Soak
Characters can resist a certain degree of physical
punishment; this is called soaking damage. Your char-

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

acter’s soak dice pool is equal to her Stamina. A normal human can soak only bashing damage (this reflects
the body’s natural resilience to such attacks). A vampire (or other supernatural being) is tougher, and can
thus use soak dice against lethal damage. Aggravated
damage may be soaked only with the Discipline of Fortitude. Fortitude also adds to the defender’s soak rating
against bashing or lethal damage (so a character with
Stamina 3 and Fortitude 2 has five soak dice against
bashing and lethal damage, but only two soak dice
against aggravated damage).

Combat Summary Chart
Stage One: Initiative
• Roll initiative (or add 6 to the initiative
rating). Everyone declares their actions. The
character with the highest initiative performs
her action first. Actions can be delayed to any
time later in the order of initiative.
• Declare any multiple actions, reducing dice
pools accordingly. Declare Discipline activation and Willpower expenditure.
Stage Two: Attack
• For unarmed close-combat attacks, roll
Dexterity + Brawl.
• For armed close-combat attacks, roll Dexterity + Melee.
• For ranged combat, roll Dexterity + Firearms (guns) or Dexterity + Athletics (thrown
weapons).
• A character can abort to a defensive action
(block, dodge, parry) at any time before her
action is performed, as long as you make a
successful Willpower roll (or a Willpower
point is spent).
Stage Three: Resolution
• Determine total damage effect (weapon
type or maneuver), adding any extra dice
gained from successes on the attack roll.
• Targets may attempt to soak damage, if
possible.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

273

After an attack hits and inflicts damage, the defender
may make a soak roll to resist. This is considered a reflexive action; characters need not take an action or
split a dice pool to soak. Unless otherwise stated, soak
rolls are made versus difficulty 6. Each soak success subtracts one die from the total damage inflicted. As with
damage rolls, soak rolls may not botch, only fail.

then adds any extra successes from the resisted roll to
her attack dice pool. On a tie, the attacker still attacks
first, although the target may perform a defensive maneuver. If the defender gets more successes, he spots
the ambush, and both parties determine initiative normally. Targets already involved in combat cannot be
ambushed.

Armor

• Blind Fighting/Fire: Staging attacks while blind
(or in pitch darkness) usually incurs a +2 difficulty, and
ranged attacks cannot be accurately made at all. Powers such as Heightened Senses (p. 134) and Eyes of the
Beast (p. 199) mitigate this penalty.

Armor adds to your character’s soak. The armor’s rating combines with your base soak for purposes of reducing damage. Light armor offers a small amount of
protection, but doesn’t greatly hinder mobility. Heavy
armor provides a lot of protection, but can restrict flexibility.
Armor protects against bashing, lethal, and aggravated damage from teeth and claws; it does not protect
against fire or sunlight. Armor is not indestructible. If
the damage rolled in a single attack equals twice the
armor’s rating, the armor is destroyed.
Armor types, their ratings, and other specifics are described on p. 280.

Combat Maneuvers
These maneuvers give you a variety of choices in
combat. Roleplaying combat is more entertaining if
you can visualize your character’s moves instead of
simply rolling dice. Most of these maneuvers take one
action to execute.

General Maneuvers
• Aborting Actions: You can abandon your character’s declared action in favor of a defensive action
as long as your character hasn’t acted in the turn. Actions that can take the place of a previously declared
action include block, dodge, and parry. A successful
Willpower roll versus difficulty 6 (or the expenditure of
a Willpower point) is required for a character to abort
an action and perform a defensive one instead. When
spending Willpower for an abort maneuver, a character may declare the Willpower expenditure at the time
of the abort. A Willpower roll to abort is considered a
reflexive action. (See “Defensive Maneuvers,” below,
for descriptions of block, dodge, and parry.)
• Ambush: Ambushes involve surprising a target to
get in a decisive first strike. The attacker rolls Dexterity + Stealth in a resisted action against the target’s
Perception + Alertness. If the attacker scores more successes, she can stage one free attack on the target; she

274

• Flank and Rear Attacks: Characters attacking
targets from the flank gain an additional attack die.
Characters attacking from the rear gain two additional
attack dice.
• Movement: A character may move half of her running distance (see “Movement,” p. 258) and still take
an action in a turn. Other maneuvers such as leaping
or tumbling may be considered separate actions, depending on their complexity.
• Multiple Actions: If you declare multiple actions,
declare the total number of actions you wish to attempt
and determine which of the dice pools is the smallest.
Then, divide that number of dice between all of your
actions. If a character performs only defensive actions
in a turn, use the appropriate block, dodge, or parry system. See Chapter Five, p. 248 for more information.
• Targeting: Aiming for a specific location incurs
an added difficulty, but can bypass armor or cover, or
can result in an increased damage effect. The Storyteller should consider special results beyond a simple
increase in damage, depending on the attack and the
target.

Defensive Maneuvers
It’s a given that your character tries to avoid being hit
in combat — that’s why everyone makes attack rolls to
try to hit you. Sometimes, though, all your character
wants to do is avoid attacks. You may announce a de-

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Maneuver Characteristics
Maneuvers are typically performed versus
difficulty 6. Maneuvers with specific combat
effects may modify your attack roll, difficulty,
or damage dice pool.
Traits: The Trait combination used for the
action taken. If your character doesn’t have
a rating in the needed Ability, default to its
base Attribute.
Accuracy: The dice added to the roll to hit
an opponent. A “+3” adds three dice to the
dice pool for that attack.
Difficulty: Any additions or subtractions to
an attack’s difficulty (which is most often 6).
A “+2” means the difficulty of an attack, if
initially 6, is increased to 8.
Damage: The damage dice pool used.

fensive action at any time before your character’s opponent makes an attack roll, as long as your character
has an action left to perform. You can declare a defensive action on your character’s turn in the initiative,
or can even abort to a defensive maneuver. You must
make a successful Willpower roll (or may simply spend
one point of Willpower) to abort. If the Willpower roll
fails, your character must carry out the action that you
declared originally.
There are three types of defensive actions: block,
dodge, and parry. Your character can defend against
virtually any kind of attack with these three maneuvers. However, your character may not be able to
avoid every single attack that’s directed at her. She
can’t dodge when there’s no room to maneuver, and
she can’t block or parry if she doesn’t know an attack
is coming.
Each defensive maneuver uses the same basic system:
The defensive action is a resisted roll against the opponent’s attack roll. Unless the attacker gets more total
successes, he misses. If the attacker gets more successes, those that he achieves in excess of the defender’s
successes, if any, are used to hit (the attacker doesn’t
necessarily use all the successes he rolled). So if the defender has fewer successes than the attacker does, the

defender’s maneuver can still reduce the effectiveness
of the attack, even if the maneuver can’t counteract it
completely.
• Block: A Dexterity + Brawl maneuver using your
character’s own body to deflect a hand-to-hand bashing attack. Lethal and aggravated attacks cannot be
blocked unless the defender has Fortitude or is wearing
armor.
• Dodge: A Dexterity + Athletics maneuver useful for avoiding attacks of all types. Your character
bobs and weaves to avoid Melee or Brawl attacks (if
there’s no room to maneuver, she must block or parry
instead). In gunfights, your character moves at least
one yard/meter and ends up behind cover (if there’s no
room to maneuver or no cover available, she can drop
to the ground). If your character remains under cover
or prone, cover rules apply against further Firearms attacks (see “Cover,” p. 278).
• Parry: A Dexterity + Melee maneuver using a
weapon to block a Brawl or Melee attack. If a character makes a Brawl attack and the defender parries with
a weapon that normally causes lethal damage, the attacker can actually be hurt by a successful parry. If the
defender rolls more successes than the attacker does
in the resisted action, the defender rolls the weapon’s
base damage plus the parry’s extra successes as a damage dice pool against the attacker.
Block, dodge, and parry can be performed as part of
a multiple action in your character’s turn (punching
then blocking, shooting then dodging, parrying then
striking). Using a multiple action to act and defend is
advantageous because your character can still accomplish something in a turn besides avoiding attacks.
Rather than having to divide your dice pool among
multiple defensive actions, you may declare that your
character spends an entire turn defending. The normal
multiple-action rules are not used in this case. Instead,
you have a full dice pool for the first defensive action,
but lose one die, cumulatively, for each subsequent defense action made in the same turn. It is still difficult
to avoid several incoming attacks, but not as difficult as
trying to attempt multiple things at once.
Remember that any actions, including defensive
ones, versus multiple attackers still suffer difficulty
penalties (see “Multiple Opponents,” p. 276).

Close Combat Maneuvers
This is simply a listing of the common maneuvers
used in close combat; feel free to develop your own

moves (with the Storyteller’s approval). All hand-tohand attacks inflict bashing damage unless stated otherwise. The damage inflicted by melee attacks depends
on the weapon type (see the Melee Weapons Chart,
p. 280). It is typically lethal, though clubs and other
blunt instruments inflict bashing damage. All references to Strength also gain the benefit of Potence, as
detailed on p. 192.
Difficulty and damage for these maneuvers may be
modified at the Storyteller’s discretion, depending on
the combat style the character uses. As always, drama
and excitement take precedence over rules systems.
• Bite: This maneuver is available only to vampires
(or other supernatural creatures with sharp teeth, such
as werewolves). A bite maneuver is a “combat” bite,
intended to cause damage rather than drain blood. Bite
damage is aggravated. To use a bite attack, the vampire
must first perform a successful clinch, hold, or tackle
maneuver (see below). On the turn following the successful attack, the player may declare the bite attempt
and make a roll using the modifiers below.
Alternatively, a player can declare her vampire’s bite
to be a “Kiss” attack. A Kiss is resolved in the same way
as a normal bite, but inflicts no health levels of damage. Upon connecting with a Kiss, the vampire may
begin to drain the victim’s blood at the normal rate,
and the victim is typically helpless to resist (see p. 269
for specifics). Following the Kiss, a vampire may, if she
chooses, lick the puncture wound of the Kiss closed,
thereby removing any evidence that she has fed.
Traits: Dexterity + Brawl

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: +1			

Damage: Strength +1

• Claw: This attack is available to vampires with
claws, such as those from the Protean power of Feral
Claws or bone spurs constructed with the Vicissitude
power of Bonecraft. A few other supernatural creatures,
such as werewolves, also have claws. A claw attack inflicts aggravated damage (if Feral Claws) or lethal damage (if a Vicissitude-constructed weapon).
Traits: Dexterity + Brawl

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Strength +1

• Clinch: On a successful attack roll, the attacker
goes into a clinch with the target. In the first turn, the
attacker may roll Strength damage. In each subsequent
turn, combatants act on their orders in the initiative.
A combatant can inflict Strength damage automatically or attempt to escape the clinch. No other actions
are allowed until one combatant breaks free. To escape

276

a clinch, make a resisted Strength + Brawl roll against
the opponent. If the escaping character has more successes, she breaks free; if not, the characters continue
to grapple in the next turn.
Traits: Strength + Brawl

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Strength

• Disarm: To strike an opponent’s weapon, the attacker must make an attack roll at +1 difficulty. If successful, the attacker rolls damage normally. If successes
rolled exceed the opponent’s Strength rating, the opponent takes no damage but is disarmed. A botch usually means the attacker drops her own weapon or is
struck by her target’s weapon.
Traits: Dexterity + Melee

Difficulty: +1

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Special

• Hold: This attack inflicts no damage, as the intent
is to immobilize rather than injure the subject. On a
successful roll, the attacker holds the target until the
subject’s next action. At that time, both combatants
roll resisted Strength + Brawl actions; the subject remains immobilized (able to take no other action) until
she rolls more successes than the attacker does.
Traits: Strength + Brawl

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: None

• Kick: Kicks range from simple front kicks to aerial
spins. The base attack is at +1 difficulty and inflicts the
attacker’s Strength +1 in damage. These ratings may
be modified further at the Storyteller’s discretion, increasing in damage and/or difficulty as the maneuver
increases in complexity.
Ability: Dexterity + Brawl

Difficulty: +1

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Strength +1

• Multiple Opponents: A character who battles
multiple opponents in close combat suffers attack and
defense difficulties of +1, cumulative, for each opponent after the first (to a maximum of +4).
• Strike: The attacker lashes out with a fist. The
base attack is a standard action and inflicts the character’s Strength in damage. The Storyteller may adjust
the difficulty and/or damage depending on the type of
punch: hook, jab, haymaker, karate strike.
Traits: Dexterity + Brawl

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Strength

• Sweep: The attacker uses her own legs to knock
the legs out from under her opponent. The target takes
Strength damage and must roll Dexterity + Athletics

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

(difficulty 8) or suffer a knockdown (see “Maneuver
Complications,” p. 279).
The attacker can also use a staff, chain, or similar implement to perform a sweep. The effect is the same, although the target takes damage per the weapon type.

• Tackle: The attacker rushes her opponent, tackling him to the ground. The attack roll is at +1 difficulty, and the maneuver inflicts Strength +1 damage.
Additionally, both combatants must roll Dexterity
+ Athletics (difficulty 7) or suffer a knockdown (see
“Maneuver Complications,” p. 279). Even if the target’s Athletics roll succeeds, he is unbalanced, suffering +1 difficulty to his actions for the next turn.
Traits: Strength + Brawl

Difficulty: +1

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Strength +1

• Weapon Length: It is difficult to get in range with
a punch or knife if someone else is wielding a sword or
staff. A character being fended off with a longer weapon must close in one yard/meter before striking, losing
a die from her attack roll in the process.

• Weapon Strike: A slashing blow, thrust, or jab,
depending on the weapon used. See the Melee Weapons Chart, p. 280, for particulars.
Traits: Dexterity + Melee

Difficulty: Normal

Accuracy: Normal		

Damage: Weapon type

Ranged Combat Maneuvers
Many physical conflicts involve ranged weapons.
The following maneuvers allow for a number of useful actions during a firefight. Don’t feel limited by this
list; if the need arises, try developing a new maneuver
(at the Storyteller’s discretion). Refer to the Ranged
Weapons Chart, p. 281, for specific information.
• Aiming: The attacker adds one die to her attack
dice pool on a single shot for each turn spent aiming.
The maximum number of dice that can be added in
this way is equal to the character’s Perception, and a
character must have Firearms 1 or better to use this
maneuver. A scope adds two more dice to the attacker’s pool in the first turn of aiming (in addition to those
added for Perception). The attacker may do nothing
but aim during this time. Additionally, it isn’t possible
to aim at a target that is moving faster than a walk.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• Automatic Fire: The weapon unloads its entire
ammunition clip in one attack against a single target.
The attacker makes a single roll, adding 10 dice to her
accuracy. However, the attack roll is at a +2 difficulty
due to the weapon’s recoil. Extra successes add to the
damage dice pool, which is still treated as equivalent
to one bullet. An attacker using automatic fire may not
target a specific area of the body.
This attack is permissible only if the weapon’s clip is
at least half-full to begin with.
Traits: Dexterity + Firearms Difficulty: +2
Accuracy: +10		

Damage: Special

• Cover: Cover increases an attacker’s difficulty to
hit a target (and often the target’s ability to fire back).
Difficulty penalties for hitting a target under various
types of cover are listed below. A character who fires
back from behind cover is also at something of a disadvantage to hit, as he exposes himself and ducks back
under protection. Firearms attacks made by a defender
who is under cover are at one lower difficulty than listed below. (If a listed difficulty is +1, then the defender
suffers no penalty to make attacks from under that
cover.) If your character hides behind a wall, attackers’
Firearms rolls have a +2 difficulty. Your character’s attacks staged from behind that wall are at +1 difficulty.
Note that difficulties for combatants who are both
under cover are cumulative. If one combatant is prone
and one is behind a wall, attacks staged by the prone
character are at +2 difficulty, while attacks staged by
the character behind the wall are also at +2 difficulty.

• Reloading: Reloading takes one full turn and requires the character’s concentration. Like any other
maneuver, reloading can be performed as part of a multiple action.
• Strafing: Instead of aiming at one target, fully-automatic weapons can be fired across an area. Strafing
adds 10 dice to accuracy on a standard attack roll, and
empties the clip. A maximum of three yards/meters
can be covered with this maneuver.
The attacker divides any successes gained on the attack roll evenly among all targets in the covered area
(successes assigned to hit an individual are added to
that target’s damage dice pool, as well). If only one
target is within range or the area of effect, only half
the successes affect him. The attacker then assigns any
leftover successes as she desires. If fewer successes are
rolled than there are targets, only one may be assigned
per target until they are all allocated.
Dodge rolls against strafing are at +1 difficulty.
Ability: Dexterity + Firearms Difficulty: +2
Accuracy: +10		

Damage: Special

• Three-Round Burst: The attacker gains two additional dice on a single attack roll, and expends three
shots from the weapon’s clip. Only certain weapons
may perform this maneuver; see the Ranged Weapons
Chart for particulars. Attacks are made at +1 difficulty
due to recoil. As with automatic fire, the damage dice
pool is based on one bullet from the weapon in question.
Ability: Dexterity + Firearms Difficulty: +1

• Multiple Shots: An attacker with a fast firearm
may try to take more than one shot in a turn. The attacker can divide his attack dice pool by how many
shots she wants to fire at a similar number of targets,
up to the weapon’s rate of fire (multiple attacks against
the same target are covered under maneuvers like “Automatic Fire” and “Three-Round Burst”). Each attack
is then rolled separately.
Accuracy: Special

• Two Weapons: Firing two weapons is considered
performing a multiple action, complete with dividing the dice of the lowest pool between two different
targets. Additionally, the attacker suffers +1 difficulty
for the attack with her off-hand (unless she’s ambidextrous). Each attack is rolled and resolved separately
— multiple attacks made against the same target are
covered by maneuvers such as “Automatic Fire” and
“Three-Round Burst.”

The target must spend her next available turn shaking off the attack’s effects. Only damage successes that
penetrate the defender’s soak attempt count toward

Maneuver Complications
The following are common combat complications.
The Storyteller should add any others as the situation
warrants.

• Immobilization: Add two dice to attack rolls made
on an immobilized (i.e., held by someone or something)
but still struggling target. Attacks hit automatically if
the target is completely immobilized (tied up, staked,
or otherwise paralyzed).

• Blinded: Add two dice to attack rolls made against
a blinded target. Furthermore, blind characters are at
+2 difficulty on all actions.
• Dazed: If, in a single attack, the attacker rolls a
number of damage successes greater than the target’s
Stamina (for mortals) or Stamina + 2 (for vampires
and other supernatural beings), the victim is dazed.

• Knockdown: The victim falls down. After suffering a knockdown, the subject makes a Dexterity +
Athletics roll. If successful, she may get back on her

feet immediately, but her initiative is reduced by two
in the next turn. On a failed roll, the subject spends
her next action climbing to her feet, if she chooses to
rise. On a botch, she lands particularly hard or at a severe angle, taking an automatic health level of bashing
damage.

• Stake Through Heart: A vampire can indeed be
incapacitated by the classic wooden stake of legend.
However, the legends err on one point: A Kindred
impaled through the heart with a wooden stake is not
destroyed, but merely paralyzed until the stake is removed.

Maneuvers like tackle and sweep are intended to
knock an opponent down. However, an especially
powerful attack of any kind may send the target to the
ground. Such instances are best left to the Storyteller’s
discretion, and should occur only when appropriately
cinematic or suitable to the story.

To stake a vampire, an attacker must target the heart
(difficulty 9). If the attack succeeds and inflicts at least
three health levels of damage, the target is immobilized. An immobilized victim is conscious (and may use
perception powers, such as those in the Auspex Discipline), but may not move or spend blood points.

Armor adds its rating to the character’s soak
dice pool against bashing damage, lethal
damage, and aggravated damage from fangs
and claws. It does not protect against fire
or sunlight. However, armor also subtracts
a number of dice from dice pools related to
bodily coordination and agility (most Dexterity-based dice pools). This is reflected in the
penalty listing. Attackers may make targeting
rolls to hit unprotected portions of a defender
and thus ignore the armor (Storyteller assigns
difficulty penalty — typically +1 or +2).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Health
As mentioned in Chapter Three, your character has a
Health Trait comprising seven health levels. Although
vampires are immortal and do not die naturally, sufficient injury can incapacitate them, drive them into
lengthy periods of dormancy, or even kill them once
more (this time for good).

The Health Chart
The Health chart on the character sheet helps you
track your character’s current physical condition. It
also lists the penalty imposed on your dice pool for
each level of injury that your character sustains. As
your character suffers more injuries, her health declines
until she becomes incapacitated or dies.
Every character has seven health levels, ranging
from Bruised to Incapacitated. Characters can also be
in full health (with no health levels checked off), in

torpor, or dead. When an attacker scores a success on
a damage roll, your character takes one health level of
damage. This is marked on your character sheet in the
appropriate box, although the mark you make depends
on the type of damage inflicted (see “Applying Damage,” below).
The number to the left of the lowest marked box
indicates your current dice penalty. As your character
gets more and more battered, it’s increasingly difficult
for him to perform even the simplest of tasks. The dice
penalty is subtracted from your dice pool for every action (except reflexive actions such as soak) until the
wound heals.
The penalty also indicates impaired movement. For
convenience, we reprint the Health chart from Chapter Three.
• Incapacitated: The stage immediately before torpor, incapacitation differs from unconsciousness in
that your character collapses from the combined effects

of physical trauma and pain. She falls to the ground
and may do nothing except spend blood points to heal
damage. Further damage suffered by an incapacitated
vampire sends her into torpor or, if the damage is aggravated, inflicts Final Death on her.
• Torpor: Torpor is the deathlike sleep common to
the undead, particularly among ancient vampires. Torpor may be entered voluntarily (certain undead, weary
of the current age, enter torpor in hopes of reawakening
in a more hospitable time) or involuntarily (through
wounds or loss of blood). Once in torpor, a character
remains dormant for a period of time depending on her
Humanity or Path rating.
As mentioned, characters with zero blood points in
their blood pools begin to lose health levels each time
the rules call for them to spend blood. When a vampire falls below Incapacitated in this fashion, she enters torpor. There she will remain until someone feeds
her at least a blood point. If this happens, she may rise,
regardless of Humanity or Path rating. This sort of revivification works only for vampires who enter torpor
from blood loss.

Vampires who enter torpor due to wounds must rest
for a period depending on their Humanity or Path rating:

Following this period of rest, the player may spend
a blood point and make an Awakening roll (p. 262)
for her character to rise. If the vampire has no blood
in her body, she may not rise until she is fed; if the
player fails the Awakening roll, she may spend another

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

283

blood point and make an Awakening roll the following
night. If the vampire rises successfully, she is considered Crippled and should either spend blood or hunt
immediately.
A character may enter torpor voluntarily. This state
resembles the character’s normal daily rest, but is a
deeper form of slumber and should not be entered into
lightly. A vampire in voluntary torpor may rise after
half the mandatory time period for involuntary torpor,
but must make an Awakening roll to do so. A torpid
vampire may ignore the nightly need for blood; she is
effectively in hibernation.
Mortals have no torpor rating; if reduced below Incapacitated, they die.
• Final Death: If a vampire is at the Incapacitated
health level or in torpor and takes one more level of
aggravated damage, he dies permanently. A player’s
character who meets Final Death is removed from the
game; the player must create a new character if she
wishes to continue play.
An incapacitated or torpid vampire may also be sent
to Final Death through massive amounts of bashing
or lethal trauma (decapitated, trapped under a 10-ton
rock, fed into a wood chipper, caught at ground zero
of an explosion, crushed by deep-sea pressure, etc.).
Typically, this damage must be enough to destroy or
dismember the corpse beyond repair.

Optional Rule: Extras
To make large fights cinematic and easy to
manage, assign “extra” Storyteller characters
only four health levels: Hurt -1, Maimed -3,
Incapacitated, and Dead. Extras are nameless (usually mortal or ghoul) thugs whom
characters run into from time to time, not key
Storyteller characters. They’re diversions who
are usually controlled by the more important
enemies whom your characters are really after.
These extras are a plot device, and shouldn’t
interfere with the main story. After taking
a few lumps, extras retreat, surrender, or fall
over so the real action can get underway.

284

Applying Damage
There are three damage types in Vampire. Bashing
damage includes all forms of temporary injury — from
punches, clubs, and other blunt trauma. Vampires, and
only vampires, consider firearms attacks to be bashing
damage as well — unless the bullets are aimed at the
head (difficulty 8), in which case they are considered
lethal. Vampires can suffer bashing damage, but consider it more of an annoyance than anything else. Lethal
damage covers permanent, killing wounds. Humans
die easily from lethal injury, and even the undead can
be traumatized by massive amounts of lethal damage.
Finally, aggravated damage includes those forces even
other vampires fear — fire, sunlight, and the teeth and
claws of their own kind.
All types of injuries are cumulative, and the combined
injury determines your character’s current health level.
Specifics on each type of damage are provided below.
Bashing and lethal damage differ in their effects,
but for vampires, both types of damage are considered
normal. Bashing damage is recorded as a slash (“/”) in
the appropriate Health chart box, while lethal damage
is marked with an “X.” Aggravated damage is marked
with an asterisk (“*”) for each level inflicted. Aggravated damage always gets marked above lethal, which
gets marked above bashing. So if you mark a level of
lethal damage in the Bruised box, and take one aggravated health level later on, “move down” the lethal
level to the Hurt box by marking that box with a “X.”
The aggravated level is then noted by simply drawing
another line through the Bruised box, turning it into
“*.” Bashing and lethal levels taken after aggravated
levels are simply drawn in on the next open box. Normal damage isn’t as severe as aggravated, so it’s always
marked last and healed first (see below).

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Bashing Damage
Bashing damage covers all forms of injury that aren’t
likely to kill instantly and that fade relatively quickly. Most forms of hand-to-hand combat — punches,
clinches, kicks, tackles, and the like — inflict bashing
damage. Bashing damage generally impairs less than
lethal damage does, and heals faster.
Vampires are relatively unaffected by bashing damage — a punch to the gut has little effect on the undead. However, massive concussive trauma can send a
vampire into torpor.
Mortals may soak bashing damage with their Stamina,
while vampires may also soak bashing damage with their
Stamina (+ Fortitude, if they have that Discipline). After the soak roll, any bashing damage applied to a vampire is halved (round down) — the Kindred’s corpselike
bodies simply don’t bruise and break like the kine’s.
If your character falls to Incapacitated and then takes
another level of bashing damage, she enters torpor
(p. 283). If your character falls to Incapacitated due to
bashing damage but then takes a level of aggravated
damage, she meets Final Death.

Lethal Damage
Lethal damage is just that — lethal, at least to mortals. Even vampires take a sword-wielder seriously — a
vampire who is hacked to bits or decapitated will die the
Final Death, though not as readily as a mortal. Knives,
bullets, swords, and the like all cause lethal wounds. At
the Storyteller’s option, blunt attacks aimed at a vital
body part such as a kidney (difficulty 8 or 9 to target)
can cause lethal damage, particularly versus mortals.
Lethal damage is intended to cause immediate and
grievous injury. For the kine, lethal injuries take a long
time to heal and usually require medical attention for any
hope of recovery. For well-fed vampires, knife wounds,
shotgun blasts, and the like are simply annoying.
Mortal characters may not soak lethal damage at all
— all such damage is applied directly to their health
levels. Kindred characters may soak lethal damage normally with Stamina (+ Fortitude, if they have it). Lethal
damage that penetrates the soak roll is applied normally
to their health levels. However, lethal damage is considered normal for the purpose of healing, so vampires may
easily nullify lethal damage by spending blood points.
When your character’s Health boxes fill to Incapacitated and she takes a further level of lethal damage, she
enters torpor (p. 283). If your character is reduced to

Incapacitated via lethal damage, and she takes a further
level of aggravated damage, she meets Final Death.

Aggravated Damage
Certain attacks are anathema to the undead. Fire
and the rays of the sun inflict terrible wounds on the
undead, as can the teeth and claws of other vampires
(and werewolves or other supernatural creatures).
As mentioned, each level of aggravated damage should
be marked with an “*” on the Health chart. Aggravated
damage may not be soaked except with the Discipline
of Fortitude. Moreover, aggravated damage is far more
difficult to heal. A level of aggravated damage may be
healed only with a full day of rest and the expenditure
of five blood points (though a vampire may, at the end
of the full day’s rest, cure additional aggravated health
levels by spending an additional five blood points and
one Willpower point per extra aggravated health level
to be healed). Worst of all, a vampire who loses his
last health level due to aggravated damage meets Final
Death — his eternal life ends at last, and he goes to
whatever awaits him beyond the grave.
Mortals may ignore sunlight, but still take damage
from fire, fangs, and claws. Aggravated damage to mortals is treated as lethal wounds instead.

Mortals’ Healing Times
Though the power of their Blood enables vampires
to heal most wounds instantly, mortal “licksticks” are
not so fortunate. The following systems allow Storytellers to simulate the effects of damage on vampires’
mortal foes, friends… and prey.
Like vampires, mortals have seven health levels and
suffer dice pool penalties for wounds. Unlike vampires,
mortals can heal their wounds only through time, rest,
and medical care. Moreover, mortals have no “torpor”
state; any amount of damage below the Incapacitated
level kills them. Mortals can soak bashing damage, but
cannot soak lethal or aggravated damage (though mortals take no damage from sunlight).
Each level of damage to a mortal (whether bashing or
lethal) must be healed individually. Thus, if a mortal takes
enough bashing damage to reduce him to Incapacitated,
he spends a full 12 hours in a delirious state before healing
to Crippled. Healing that level takes six hours, and so on.

Healing Bashing Damage
Bashing damage up to the Wounded level can be cared
for without medical skill; these wounds heal on their own,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

285

without treatment. Bashing damage beyond Wounded may
have deeper consequences. A mortal’s vision or hearing
may be altered due to a concussion, she may suffer excruciating pain from internal bruising, or she may experience
some other extreme discomfort. These effects can be negated if the mortal receives adequate medical attention.
Health Level
Recovery Time
Bruised to Wounded One hour
Maimed		

Three hours

Crippled		

Six hours

Incapacitated		

12 hours

Once bashing levels reach Incapacitated, mortals fall
unconscious, but do not sink below Incapacitated…
yet. However, any further bashing wounds are X’d over
previous bashing ones, making them lethal. At that
point, recovery is handled as lethal damage. In this
way, a mortal can be slowly beaten to death.

Healing Lethal Damage
Lethal damage of any sort can be deadly — that’s why
it’s called lethal. Lethal wounds that go unattended may
continue to bleed until the mortal passes out and dies
from blood loss. Other dangers can also arise from infection, cellular damage, or broken limbs. (Aggravated
damage is considered to be lethal to a mortal.)
Any lethal damage past Hurt requires medical treatment to prevent further harm. Untreated lethal wounds
worsen by one level of lethal damage per day. When a
mortal sustains lethal damage down to Incapacitated,
he’s one health level away from death. If he takes one
more wound (whether bashing or lethal), he dies.
If the individual is at Maimed or higher, he may recover with rest over the times listed below. However, if
the mortal is Crippled or Incapacitated, no recovery is
possible unless he receives medical attention. Indeed,
at Incapacitated the individual is comatose at worse
and delirious at best, and could still die.

States of Being
The World of Darkness is a hostile place. The dangers inherent to such an uncivilized environment are
many, and they inflict the same kinds of harm that
combat does. In addition, a vampire’s greatest enemy
lies within, in the form of the Beast. Whether a vampire suffers the fiery grip of frenzy or the slow descent
into monstrousness, the Beast is ever willing to batter
the Damned.
The following systems present a variety of ways that
characters can suffer injury, whether physical, mental,
or emotional. As well, this section presents a couple of
rare and precious ways whereby the Damned can hope
to rise above their state.

Blood Bond
One of the most wondrous and terrible properties of
Kindred vitae is its ability to enslave nearly any being
who drinks of it three times. Each sip of a particular
Kindred’s blood gives the Kindred in question a greater
emotional hold over the drinker. If a being drinks three
times, on three separate nights, from the same Kindred,
she falls victim to a state known as the blood bond. A
vampire who holds a blood bond over another being is
said to be that victim’s regnant, while the being subordinate to the bond is called the thrall.
Put simply, the blood bond is one of the most potent
emotional sensations known. A blood-bound victim is
absolutely devoted to her regnant and will do nearly
anything for him. Even the most potent uses of Dominate cannot overcome the thrall’s feelings for her regnant; only true love stands a chance against the bond,
and even that is not a sure thing.
The blood bond is most commonly used to ensnare
mortals and ghouls, but Kindred can bind each other
as well. Such is the blood bond’s power that a mighty
elder can be bound to a lowly neonate; in this respect,
the blood of a Thirteenth-Generation fledgling is (presumably) as strong as that of Caine himself. As such,
the blood bond forms an essential strategy in the Jyhad;
some Ancients are said to hold dozens of influential
Kindred in secret thrall.
• First drink: The drinker begins to experience intermittent but strong feelings about the vampire. She
may dream of him, or find herself “coincidentally” frequenting places where he might show up. There is no
mechanical effect at this stage, but it should be roleplayed. All childer have this level of bond toward their

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

sires, for the Embrace itself forces one drink upon the
childer; they may love their “parents,” hate them, or
both, but are rarely indifferent toward them.
• Second drink: The drinker’s feelings grow strong
enough to influence her behavior. Though she is by
no means enslaved to the vampire, he is definitely an
important figure in her life. She may act as she pleases,
but might have to make a Willpower roll to take actions directly harmful to the vampire. The vampire’s
influence is such that he can persuade or command her
with little effort (Social rolls against the thrall are at
-1 difficulty).
• Third drink: Full-scale blood bond. At this level,
the drinker is more or less completely bound to the
vampire. He is the most important person in her life;
lovers, relatives, and even children become secondary
to her all-consuming passion.
At this level, a regnant may use the Dominate Discipline on a thrall, even without the benefit of eye contact. Merely hearing the regnant’s voice is enough. Additionally, should the thrall try to resist the Dominate
(or similar mental control power) for some reason, the
difficulty of such resistance is increased by two. Naturally, a higher-Generation vampire still cannot use
Dominate on a lower-Generation thrall.
The blood bond is true love, albeit a twisted and perverse version of it. Ultimately, we can’t reduce the vagaries of love down to a simple “yes/no” system. Some
thralls (particularly people with Conformist or other
dependent Natures, or with Willpower 5 or less) will
commit any act, including suicide or murder, for their
beloved; other characters have certain core principles
that they will not violate.
A full blood bond, once formed, is nearly inviolate.
Once bound, a thrall is under the sway of her regnant
and her regnant only. She cannot be bound again by
another vampire unless the first blood bond wears away
“naturally.” A vampire can experience lesser (one- and
two-drink) bonds toward several individuals; indeed,
many Kindred enjoy such bonds, as they create artificial passion in their dead hearts. Upon the formation
of a full blood bond, though, all lesser sensations are
wiped away. Vampire lovers occasionally enter into
mutual blood bonds with each other; this is the closest
thing the undead can feel to true love. Even this sensation can turn to disgust or hate over the centuries,
though, and in any event few Kindred trust each other
enough to initiate it.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

287

A blood bond is a mighty force, but it is at its most
potent when perpetually reinforced with further drinks.
Feeding a thrall often reinforces the bond, while depriving a thrall of vitae may cause the bond to grow
tepid over time. Like any other relationship, treatment
and courtesy play a part in the dynamics of the bond.
A thrall who is treated well and fed often will likely
fall even more deeply in love, while a thrall who is degraded and humiliated may find resentment and anger
eating away at the bond.
It is possible, though difficult, for a vampire to temporarily resist a blood bond. Doing so requires the
player to make a Willpower roll (difficulty is typically
8, though this can be modified depending on the regnant’s treatment and the thrall’s Nature) and accumulate a number of successes equal to the number of
times the thrall has partaken of the regnant’s blood, to
a maximum of difficulty 9. The thrall must then spend
a Willpower point. Upon doing so, the bond is negated
for a variable amount of time: from one scene (if the
thrall merely wishes to plot against the regnant, deliver
confidential information to an enemy, etc.) to one turn
(if the thrall wishes to attack the regnant physically).
The thrall can continue to expend Willpower to extend the duration of “freedom,” but once she ceases doing so, the blood bond resumes at full force.
A blood bond can be broken, though this requires
the thrall to not only avoid the regnant entirely for an
extended period of time, but also spend great amounts
of Willpower to overcome the addiction. As a general rule, a thrall who neither sees nor feeds from her
regnant for a period of (12 - Willpower) months finds
her bond reduced by one level (so, a fully bound thrall
with a Willpower of 5 has her blood bond reduced to
the equivalent of two drinks if she goes seven straight
months without any contact with the regnant). If the
bond is reduced to zero in this fashion (a feat typically accompanied by the expenditure of a great deal of
Willpower on the thrall’s part, as she resists the gnawing urge to seek out her sire), it is nullified entirely.
Another, though somewhat less certain, way to be rid
of the bond is to kill the regnant. Such a choice is extremely perilous on many levels, and makes no guarantees that everything will go smoothly. Those who have
been released by such means claim the bond shatters like
spun glass upon the moment of the regnant’s Final Death.
The thrall’s Nature may play a large part in whether the
control is completely ended, though, and such aftermath
is best left in the hands of the Storyteller.

288

The Vaulderie
The vampires of the Sabbat take their nightly struggle
seriously — so seriously that they tolerate no dissent in
their ranks. From the lowliest new recruit to the most
exalted Cainite, the Sabbat ensure loyalty to one another through a bloody rite known as the Vaulderie.
The Vaulderie is similar to a blood bond, though it
differs in intent and function. No Sabbat would ever
voluntarily succumb to a blood bond, reasoning that
such bonds are the tools the elders use to enslave their
childer. Rather, the Sabbat swear the Vaulderie to
each other, bonding themselves to the pack instead of
an individual, and, thus, to the Sabbat’s greater cause.
Those who are ignorant of the Vaulderie’s finer details believe it to be a simple commingling of vampire vitae in a vessel and the subsequent drinking of
it. In truth, the matter is far more mystical. To start
the ritual, the priest takes a tool used specifically for
the Vaulderie and nothing else and cuts her wrist. The
ritual cutting tool could be a small knife, silver straight
razor, or awl. To impart more gravity to the rite, many
packs use elaborate ritual bloodletters decorated with
engraved swirls, spirals, or blood droplets. The priest
then bleeds into a vessel and passes the cutting device
to each Sabbat member present, who pierces his own
flesh and bleeds into the chalice. The vessel is then
passed around the pack until everyone has poured their
blood in, before the priest recites an incantation over
it, consecrating it as a terrible sacrament before every
member of the pack draws a draught.
Vaulderies take place at any time — before assaults,
during important Sabbat gatherings, at the initiation or
Creation Rites of new members, and almost infallibly
at pack gatherings. This rite is perhaps the foundation
of the Sect, and it is afforded the most reverent status.
The result of this rite is known as a Vinculum, or bloodtie. These ties connect each member of the pack to one
another, engendering a mutual loyalty in addition to bolstering pack morale. Because of the mystical nature of the
Vaulderie, however, Vinculi are imperfect — what one
pack member feels toward another one night may pale in
comparison to what he feels toward her the next. Vinculum ratings may change every time the rite is observed.
Without the Vaulderie, the Sabbat would probably
collapse under its own weight and dogma — the chaos
and anarchy that follows the Sect would erode what
little organization it has without the loyalty and sympathy created by the rite. Those who refuse the Vaulderie or oppose it are not viewed favorably by other

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Sabbat. Vampires who refuse to partake of the Vaulderie at least monthly suffer ostracism from the pack at
best — and may be destroyed outright at worst.
The first time a character observes the Vaulderie
(or during creation of a Sabbat character), roll a die
for each character whose vitae is part of the rite. That
number reflects the Vinculum the character feels toward the individual whose blood she ingested; see the
chart for effects generated by individual Vinculi. Every
time a new member participates in the Vaulderie, each
player should roll a die and record the score for her
Vinculum rating toward that character.
Afterwards, each time the pack partakes of the Vaulderie, each player should roll one die for each of her
Vinculi. If the result is higher than the Vinculum score,
increase that Vinculum score by one (to a maximum of
10). If the result is a 1, lower the Vinculum score by
one (to a minimum of 1).
It bears mention that, like the emotions engendered
by blood bonds, these feelings are artificial, as they are
created through ingestion of blood. It is quite possible
for a character to utterly hate someone for whom she
would risk her unlife, just as it is possible to have immense love for someone who has little in the way of
Vinculum. Players are encouraged to explore the full
range of these complexities in their packs through roleplaying.
At times, a character may be at odds with herself over
how to react to a given situation because of Vinculi
she possesses toward another vampire. In cases such as
these, the player should decide which party her character would favor outside the Vinculum. The character
then rolls a number of dice for each party equal to her
Vinculum score for that individual against a difficulty
of 5 (for the party favored regardless of Vinculum) or 7
(for all other parties). The individual who receives the
greatest number of successes earns the character’s aid.
Such is the nature of the Damned and the Vinculum —
a character who knows better may sometimes be forced
into an obviously bad course of action by following her
emotions. Storytellers should consider Vinculum rolls
for matters of dramatic significance, but too much reliance on Vinculum rolls may leave players upset at being railroaded by dice rolls.
The Vaulderie can also corrode existing blood bonds.
Multiple draughts of the Vaulderie may be required,
but sooner or later, the pack‘s blood will overcome all
but the most potent of vampiric vitae. A vampire wishing to break a blood bond via Vaulderie must have no
more than one blood point in his blood pool, and must

ingest six points of Vaulderie vitae. At that point, the
old blood bond fades rapidly, replaced almost as quickly by Vinculi toward those whose blood composed the
Vaulderie. On the other hand, a vampire attempting to
replace Vinculi with a new blood bond is in for a disappointment — unless her blood is powerfully potent,
Vinculi may not be so easily erased. Unlike normal
blood bonds, Vinculi do not fade over time — a Vinculum left after a Vaulderie with a vampire in nights hundreds of years past is still as potent as the night it arose.
Indeed, many elder Sabbat have vast webs of Vinculi
connecting them to Sect members across the world.

for a reason, whether he’s a Malkavian who resided at
Bedlam before his Embrace or a Ventrue pack member
who escaped from five months of torture at the hands
of an Inquisitor. What stimuli is his insanity inflicting
on him, and how is he reacting to what’s happening?
The player should work with his Storyteller to create a
pattern of provocations for his derangement, and then
decide how his character reacts to such provocation.

Derangements

Bipolar individuals suffer from severe mood swings,
sometimes resulting from severe trauma or anxiety. Victims may be upbeat and confident one moment, then
uncontrollably lethargic and pessimistic the next.

Derangements are behaviors that are created when
the mind is forced to confront intolerable or conflicting
feelings, such as overwhelming terror or profound guilt.
When the mind is faced with impressions or emotions
that it cannot reconcile, it attempts to ease the inner
conflict by stimulating behavior such as megalomania,
bulimia, or hysteria to provide an outlet for the tension
and stress that the conflict generates.
Vampires or mortals receive derangements under
conditions of intense terror, guilt, or anxiety. If a player botches a Virtue or Willpower roll (for example,
when confronted with Rötschreck), the Storyteller
may decide that the experience causes a derangement
in the character. Other examples of derangement-inducing events include killing a loved one while in a
frenzy, being buried alive as part of a Sabbat ritual, or
seeing hundreds of years of careful scheming dashed in
an instant of bad luck. Generally, any experience that
causes intense and unpleasant emotion or thoroughly
violates a character’s beliefs or ethics is severe enough
to cause a derangement. The Storyteller determines
which derangement a character receives, working with
the player to choose (or create) one appropriate to the
character’s personality and the circumstances of the
event that caused the disorder.
It must be noted that people who are “crazy” are
neither funny nor arbitrary in their actions. Insanity
is frightening to those who are watching someone rage
against unseen presences or hoard rotten meat to feed
to the monsters that live next door; even something
as harmless-sounding as talking to an invisible rabbit
can become disturbing to observers. The insane, however, are only responding to a pattern known to them,
stimuli that they perceive in their own minds. To their
skewed perceptions, what’s happening to them is perfectly normal. Your vampire’s derangement is there

290

Derangements are a challenge to roleplay, without
question, but a little time and care can result in an experience that is dramatic for all involved.

Bipolar Disorder

Kindred with this derangement are constantly on a
hair trigger, never knowing when the next mood swing
will strike. Whenever the vampire fails a task, the Storyteller has the option of secretly making a Willpower
roll (difficulty 8) for the character. If the character fails
the roll, she lapses into depression. Additionally, the
vampire will go into depression whenever one of her
rolls is botched, or if her blood pool ever drops below
2. The Storyteller should roll a die to determine how
many scenes the character remains depressed, keeping
the number a secret.
Vampires in a depressive state have their Willpower
ratings halved (minimum 1). In addition, the vampire
may not access her blood pool to raise Attributes. Upon
emerging from the depressive state, the character is energetic, relentlessly upbeat and active (obsessively so)
for a number of scenes proportionate to the time spent
in depression. When a vampire is in this manic state,
the difficulty of all rolls to resist frenzy is raised by one.

Bulimia
Individuals with bulimia assuage their guilt and insecurity by indulging in activities that comfort them
— in this case, consuming food. A bulimic will eat
tremendous amounts of food when subjected to stress,
then empty her stomach through drastic measures so
she can eat still more.
In the case of vampires with this derangement, the
need to feed is a means of relieving the fear and anxiety
endemic to the World of Darkness. A bulimic vampire
may feed four or more times a night — gorging herself,
burning the blood in pointless (or not so pointless) activity, then starting the cycle again.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

A vampire with bulimia gets hungry much more quickly
than other vampires do. When feeding, a bulimic vampire
must make a Conscience or Conviction roll (difficulty 7).
If she fails the roll, she feeds until her blood pool is full,
whether the vampire needs the extra blood or not. A vampire who is forcibly kept from feeding risks frenzy (make a
frenzy roll, difficulty 6). The difficulty increases by one for
every 15 minutes that she is prevented from drinking.

act as she sees fit to remove the source of the stress. At
the end of the fugue, the character “regains consciousness” with no memory of her actions.

Fugue

Hysterical Kindred must make frenzy checks whenever
subjected to stress or pressure. The difficulties of these
rolls are normally 6, increasing to 8 if the stress is sudden
or especially severe. Additionally, any action that results
in a botch causes the vampire to frenzy automatically.

Victims suffering from fugue experience “blackouts”
and loss of memory. When subjected to stress, the individual begins a specific, rigid set of behaviors to remove
the stressful symptoms. This differs from multiple personalities, as the individual in the grip of a fugue has
no separate personality, but is on a form of “autopilot”
similar to sleepwalking.
Kindred suffering from this derangement require
a Willpower roll when subjected to extreme stress or
pressure (difficulty 8). If the roll fails, the player must
roleplay her character’s trancelike state; otherwise,
control of the character passes to the Storyteller for a
number of scenes determined by the roll of a die. During this period, the Storyteller may have the character

Hysteria
A person in the grip of hysteria is unable to control
her emotions, suffering severe mood swings and violent
fits when subjected to stress or anxiety.

Megalomania
Individuals with this derangement are obsessed with
accumulating power and wealth, salving their insecurities by becoming the most potent individuals in their
environment. Such individuals are invariably arrogant
and supremely sure of their abilities, convinced of their
own inherent superiority. The means of achieving their
status can take many forms, from devious conspiracies
to outright brutality. Any individual of equal or higher
status than the victim is perceived to be “competition.”

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

291

Kindred with this derangement constantly struggle
to rise to the height of power and influence, by whatever means necessary. In a megalomaniac’s view, there
are only two classes of people: those who are weaker,
and those who do not deserve the power they have and
must be made weaker. This belief extends to everyone
around the vampire, including members of her own coterie. This derangement lends an extra die to all of the
victim’s Willpower rolls, due to her towering sense of
superiority.
If a megalomaniacal vampire is presented with a
realistic chance to diablerize a more potent Kindred,
she will be sorely tempted. A Willpower roll (difficulty
9) is needed for the vampire to avoid taking “what is
rightfully hers.”

Multiple Personalities
The trauma that spawns this derangement fractures
the victim’s personality into one or more additional
personas, allowing the victim to deny her trauma or
any actions the trauma causes by placing the blame on
“someone else.” Each personality is created to respond
to certain emotional stimuli — an abused person might
develop a tough-as-nails survivor personality, create a
“protector,” or even become a murderer in order to
deny the abuse she is suffering. In most cases none of
the personalities is aware of the others, and they come
and go through the victim’s mind in response to specific situations or conditions.
When a vampire suffers this derangement, the Storyteller and the player must agree upon how many and
what kind of personalities develop, and the situations
that trigger their dominance in the victim. Each personality should be relevant to the trauma that causes
it. Not only is each personality distinct, but in the case
of Kindred, the different personalities might believe
themselves to be from different Clans and sires.
Kindred with multiple personalities can manifest
different Abilities and even Virtues for each of their
personalities, but it is the Storyteller’s responsibility to
determine the specific details.

Obsessive-Compulsive
The trauma, guilt, or inner conflict that causes this
derangement forces the individual to focus nearly all
of her attention and energy onto a single repetitive behavior or action. Obsession relates to an individual’s
desire to control her environment — keeping clean,
keeping an area quiet and peaceful, or keeping undesirable individuals from an area, for example. A compul-

292

sion is an action or set of actions that an individual is
driven to perform to soothe her anxieties: for example,
placing objects in an exact order, or feeding from a
mortal in a precise, ritualistic fashion.
Vampires with an obsessive-compulsive derangement
must determine a set of specific actions or behaviors, as
described above, and follow them to the exclusion of
all else. The effects of obsessive-compulsive behavior
can be negated for the course of one scene by spending a temporary Willpower point. The difficulty of any
attempt to coerce or Dominate a vampire into ceasing
her behavior is raised by one. If a vampire is forcibly
prevented from adhering to her derangement, she automatically frenzies.

Paranoia
The victim of paranoia believes that her misery and
insecurity stem from external persecution and hostility. Paranoid individuals obsess about their persecution
complexes, often creating vast and intricate conspiracy
theories to explain who is tormenting them and why.
Anyone or anything perceived to be “one of them” is
often subjected to violence.
Kindred who suffer from paranoia have difficulty
with social interaction; the difficulties of all dice rolls
involving interaction are increased by one. They are
distrustful and suspicious of everyone, even their own
blood-bound progeny. The slightest hint of suspicious
behavior is enough to provoke a frenzy roll, with the
difficulty relative to the degree of the behavior. This
paranoia may even extend to complex and rigorous
feeding practices, to keep “them” from contaminating
the vampire’s food supply.

Sanguinary Animism
This derangement is unique to the Kindred, a response to vampires’ deep-seated guilt regarding the act
of feeding on the blood of mortals. Kindred with this
derangement believe that they do not merely consume
victims’ blood, but their souls as well, which are then
made a part of the vampire’s consciousness. In the
hours after feeding, the vampire hears the voice of her
victim inside her head and feels a tirade of “memories”
from the victim’s mind — all created by the vampire’s
subconscious. In extreme cases, this sense of possession
can drive a Kindred to carry out actions on behalf of her
victims. Diablerie would be particularly unwise for an
animist. Whenever a vampire with this derangement
feeds on a mortal, a Willpower roll is needed (difficulty
6, or 9 if she drains the mortal to the point of death). If
the roll succeeds, she is tormented by the “memories”

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

of the person whose soul she has partially consumed,
but is still able to function normally. If the roll fails,
then the images in her mind are so strong that it is akin
to having a second personality inside her, an angry and
reproachful personality that seeks to cause harm to the
vampire and her associates. The player must roleplay
this state as if the mind of her victim in control. During the moments just before dawn, control reverts to
the vampire.

Schizophrenia
Conflicting, unresolveable sets of feelings and impulses can cause a victim to develop schizophrenia,
which manifests as a withdrawal from reality, violent
changes in behavior, and hallucinations. Roleplaying
this derangement requires careful thought, because the
player must determine a general set of behaviors relevant to the trauma that caused the derangement. The
hallucinations, bizarre behavior, and unseen voices
stem from a terrible inner conflict that the individual
cannot resolve. The player needs to establish a firm
idea of what that conflict is and then rationalize what
kind of behavior this conflict will cause.
Kindred with this derangement are unpredictable
and dangerous. In situations that trigger a vampire’s inner conflict, the difficulties of all rolls to resist or direct
frenzy increase by three, and the vampire loses three
dice from all Willpower rolls.

Deterioration
A vampire who is staked or otherwise paralyzed continues to spend blood at the rate of one point per night.
If the vampire is further deprived of blood, the decaying process that unlife has held at bay begins again.
A vampire with no blood begins consuming all excess
moisture within his body at a rate of one health level
per day. As the process continues, the vampire begins
to resemble a mummified corpse. At first the vampire
appears merely emaciated, but as the body is completely dehydrated, the meat and ligaments, along with the
mostly useless organs within the body, begin to wither.
By the seventh day, when the character has reached
Incapacitated on the Health chart, the character’s eyes
shrivel within his skull, the tendons and ligaments
within the body draw painfully tight, the gums recede
from the teeth, and the lips draw back in a death rictus.
At this point, the character enters torpor.
Once in torpor, the character cannot rise unless
supplied with enough blood to bring him back to Injured on the Health chart (at least four blood points).

A vampire emerging from this state is ravenous to the
point of insanity, and will attack whatever source of
blood is closest, regardless of any emotional ties.
Leaving a vampire staked until he reaches this neardeath state, then reviving him with just enough blood
to prolong the agony, is a favorite method of torture
for both mortal hunters and the Sabbat. Most vampires
undergoing this form of torture suffer permanent mental damage as a result.

Diablerie
There is one thing that elder Kindred dread even
more than fire or the light of the sun. This is the sin
known as diablerie. Among Camarilla society, diablerie is the ultimate crime; those who practice it are
subject to the harshest punishments imaginable. It is
as loathed and feared as cannibalism is among mortal
society. The vampires of the Sabbat are said to indulge
in diablerie freely, which is yet another reason why Camarilla elders hate them so.
Quite simply, diablerie is the act of feeding on a vampire in the way that a vampire feeds on a mortal. In so
doing, not only does the murderer consume the victim’s blood (and vampire blood is far, far sweeter than
even the tastiest mortal’s), but the victim’s power as
well. By stealing the life of a vampire closer to Caine,
the vampire can permanently enrich his own vitae. In
this manner even the youngest vampire can gain the
power of the elders.
Elders know the crime as the Amaranth; in olden
nights, it is said, an amaranth flower was presented to
the victim a week before he was to be hunted. Kindred legend tells many dark tales of murderous childer
betraying and cannibalizing their own sires, and it is
for this reason more than any other that elder Kindred
harbor such distrust for the neonates among them. Indeed, the great Jyhad itself may well have its roots in
this eternal and savage struggle for power.

Committing Diablerie
A vampire seeking to commit diablerie must drain
all the blood from his Kindred victim. Following this
act, the vampire must continue to suck, for (according
to Kindred legend) the very soul is withdrawn from the
victim’s body and taken into the diablerist’s. The effort
involved in diablerie is monumental, for the vampiric
soul is a greedy thing and clings tenaciously to unlife,
hoping to regenerate its body and rise once again.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

293

Once a vampire’s body has been drained of all blood,
the true struggle begins. The diablerist’s player makes
an extended Strength roll (difficulty 9). Each success
inflicts one automatic health level on the victim (the
victim cannot soak, and damage is considered aggravated). When all the victim’s health levels have been
drained, the victim’s essence is taken into the attacker
and the emptied body begins decaying immediately.

Moreover, drinking the vitae of elder vampires can induce a temporary increase in the diablerist’s Discipline
levels (by one, two, or even more dots), as the potent
blood augments the predator’s own mystic arts. If the elder
vampire was several Generations removed from the diablerist’s own Generation, the effects can seem miraculous,
even if they are short lived. These increased powers last for
a single scene, unless the Storyteller decides otherwise.

A vampire committing diablerie is quite vulnerable
to attack. Total concentration goes into the struggle to
draw forth the essence of the victim, and stopping for
even a moment ruins the chance of capturing the spirit. All attacks against a vampire attempting diablerie
are made versus a difficulty of 2.

To commit diablerie, the diablerist must take blood
directly and immediately from the victim; the blood
may not be stored and used later. Moreover, only one
diablerist may commit the act on a given victim; a pack
of neonates cannot swarm around an elder like hungry
sharks, no matter how potent the victim’s blood.

The Rewards of Diablerie

The Perils of Diablerie

Upon successful completion of diablerie, the diablerist is overwhelmed by euphoria, and a Self-Control/Instincts roll is necessary (difficulty 10 minus the character’s Humanity or Path rating) to avoid losing control.
The sensation is akin to orgasm, but much more powerful — so powerful, in fact, that certain Kindred are
addicted to the sensation. All other Kindred fear these
vampires for their addiction to the pleasures of Amaranth makes them a threat to everyone. Even vampires
too weak to provide additional power are devoured for
the simple pleasure of the act.

Committing diablerie seems like the perfect crime
to many power-hungry neonates. There is no body left
when the deed is done, as most vampires over a decade
old quickly rot into unrecognizable mounds of carrion.
Without solid evidence, it’s difficult for even the most
despotic Prince to make an outright accusation of murder. But those who commit the atrocity soon learn that
diablerists wear the evidence of their crime on their very
souls. Vampires with the Auspex Discipline can detect a
diablerist by using Aura Perception. The stolen energies
of the victim mingle with the energies of the diablerist,
leaving thick black marks running through the diablerist’s aura. These marks stand out as clearly as motor oil
on a crystal-clear pond, covering the softer colors of the
vampire’s own aura and betraying the crime.

The true benefit of diablerie becomes evident if the
diablerist feeds on the vitae of a vampire of lower Generation (e.g., if a Ninth-Generation vampire commits
diablerie on a Seventh-Generation vampire). The diablerist literally steals the power and potency of the victim’s own blood, and thus permanently lowers her own
Generation by one, bringing her closer to the mythical
power of Caine. All benefits of the lowered Generation
— a larger and more potent blood pool, the ability to
Dominate more Kindred and, in some cases, the ability
to increase Traits above 5 — are bestowed upon the
vampire.
If the victim was of far greater power (five or more
Generation levels) than the diablerist, the Storyteller
may rule that the predator lowers her Generation by
more than one step. This is particularly likely if the
victim was ancient (two millennia or more). It would
not be unreasonable for a Twelfth-Generation neonate who drank the blood of a 3000-year-old member
of the Fifth Generation to advance three or even more
Generation steps. Ultimately, this decision rests in the
Storyteller’s hands.

294

Not all vampires know of diablerie or the stains it
leaves behind. Many younger Kindred might simply
question the odd discoloration on the vampire’s aura.
Most elder vampires understand what the stains mean,
though, and could well call for the diablerist’s immediate punishment or use the information as blackmail
at a later date. These marks remain in evidence for a
number of years equal to the difference between the
victim’s Generation and the diablerist’s original Generation (mimimum one year, even if the victim was
higher Generation). In example, if a Twelfth-Generation vampire drinks the blood of a Ninth-Generation
vampire (becoming Eleventh Generation in the process), the evidence remains on his aura for three years.
Additionally, practitioners of Thaumaturgy can use
the Path of Blood to detect the diablerist’s sin, even
centuries after the crime was committed. For that reason, in particular, practitioners of the Amaranth fear
the Tremere.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Even those without special perceptions often sense
a “taint” about the diablerist. For one month per Generation removed from the victim, a diablerist gives off
a “vibe” that leaves more sensitive Kindred unsettled.
The Kindred in question may not actually know what
the diablerist did, but they’ll feel uncomfortable around
him just the same. A player whose vampire comes in
contact with a diablerist may make a Perception roll
(difficulty of 12 minus the sensing vampire’s Humanity rating — vampires with high Humanity are more
aware of such things) to notice that something about
the diablerist just “doesn’t feel right.” Followers of alternate Paths of morality (see Chapter Ten) generally
fail to notice the unusual sensation, as they are no longer attuned to their emotions in the same way. The
Storyteller has final say in these matters.
A few rumors speak of diablerists displaying certain
mannerisms of their late victims, particularly if the victims were of great psychic fortitude (Willpower 10) and
of much stronger Blood than their murderers. If this is
true, and the soul of a particularly mighty undead can
manifest in the body of its killer, the implications are
frightening, particularly in light of the Jyhad.
Such is the horror of diablerie that, according to
most elders, even a blood hunt is no grounds for its
practice. Hunters may drink a victim’s blood, even to
the last drop, but may not continue the process of diablerie once the victim is drained. Indeed, by decree of
the Inner Circle, only a sire is permitted to diablerize
her childe, and then only during a blood hunt. In practice, many younger Kindred take every opportunity a
blood hunt’s chaos affords, and Princes may look the
other way if the criminal was heinous enough.
Lastly, for Camarilla vampires and others who adhere
to the way of Humanity, there is the loss of Humanity
to consider. Diablerie is worse than murder: The Amaranth literally absorbs the victim’s soul, destroying any
chance of the victim finding peace in the afterlife. Such
a heinous crime strips a minimum of one Humanity dot
from the character’s Humanity rating. Additionally, for
extremely vicious attacks, the Storyteller might require
a Conscience roll (difficulty 8). Failure means the loss
of an additional Humanity point, while a botch could
well mean the loss of even more.

Disease
There are certain advantages to being a walking
corpse. One of the biggest is a natural immunity to
most diseases. AIDS, SARS, cancer, syphilis, and other illnesses mean little or nothing to the undead.

But immunity to disease doesn’t mean the vampires
can ignore diseases. Any illness that can be transmitted by the blood is a potential problem for vampires,
because they can carry the illness and transmit it from
victim to victim. Indeed, several Kindred have become
active carriers for HIV. By drinking from someone infected with HIV and then feeding on different victims,
these vampires have helped to spread a particularly
virulent infection.
In some fiefdoms, any vampire found carrying such
a blood-borne disease is locked away for the good of
the herd. In rare cases such carriers have even been
put to Final Death for spreading disease. Such plaguedogs are frowned upon heavily in the Camarilla, for
not only does disease threaten the human populace,
but victims of the disease might speak of their affiliation with vampires, putting the Masquerade in grave
danger. Even the vampires of the Sabbat, with their
lack of concern for the herd, have begun to consider
regulations regarding disease carriers.
An Intelligence + Medicine roll (difficulty 7) will allow characters to detect the presence of blood-related
diseases. On a failed roll, the vampire does not notice
the symptoms and exposes himself to disease (Stamina
roll, difficulty 6, to avoid). A botch indicates the character feeds sloppily and automatically becomes a carrier for the disease.
Kindred legends speak of certain plagues potent
enough to affect vampires. Very few vampires have
any knowledge of such ailments, and those who do are
highly prized. Despite the Kindred’s formidable powers, they are ill-prepared to handle the occasional illness that can cause them harm.

Electrocution
Vampires are not nearly so affected by simple electricity as are mortals. Nonetheless, electrocution might
occasionally prove a danger. The strength of the electrical flow determines the amount of lethal damage
a character takes from electrocution. She suffers the
damage effect noted below each turn until contact
with the source is severed (Strength roll to pull away;
difficulty 5 for vampires, 9 for mortals). Vampires may
soak this damage normally, but, if a soak roll is botched,
the damage is considered aggravated — the vampire’s
bloodstream and brain are fried.
Electrical damage is a lethal effect, and armor doesn’t
protect against it (depending on the subject’s defenses,
the circumstance, and the Storyteller’s decision).

If a mortal character is subjected to significant
amounts of electrical damage (that reduce her to Incapacitated), she may suffer permanent damage. This can
be physical impairment (reduced Physical Attributes),
permanent memory loss, brain damage (reduced Mental Attributes), or disfigurement (reduced Appearance). Specifics are up to the Storyteller.

Faith
According to Kindred legend, the Curse of Caine has
made all vampires forever outcast in the eyes of God.
This might or might not be the case, but it is quite
true that symbols or persons of great religious faith can
cause discomfort or even harm to the Damned.
Most mortals, even supposedly devout ones, lack the
ability to affect the Kindred with faith alone. However,
certain mortals — those with the True Faith Trait —
can use their devotion as a defense or weapon against
vampires. See page 372 for further information.

Falling
Even vampires can suffer great damage from falling
significant distances. The Storyteller rolls one die of
bashing damage for every 10 feet or 3 meters (rounded
down) that your character falls before hitting something solid.
Falling damage may be soaked normally. Landing on
sharp objects can change the damage from bashing to
lethal at the Storyteller’s discretion.
If your character plummets 100 feet (30 meters) or
more, she reaches terminal velocity. The damage effect reaches a maximum of 10 dice at this point, and it
is considered lethal damage. Additionally, any armor
your character wears in a terminal-velocity fall functions at only half its rating (rounded down), since it’s
not designed for this sort of punishment.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Fire and Burns

Frenzy and Rötschreck

Vampires fear fire, for it is one of the few things that
can end their immortal existences. Fire damage is aggravated and ignores armor; it may be soaked only with
Fortitude. A fire’s size determines the levels of aggravated damage a character endures per turn, while its
heat determines the difficulty of the Fortitude soak roll.
A character suffers the full damage effect for each turn
that she’s in contact with the flames; she must leave
the area and/or put out any fire on her to stop taking
damage. All damage inflicted by fire is automatically
successful unless soaked (i.e., a character trapped in a
bonfire takes two automatic health levels of damage per
turn, not the results of two damage dice per turn).

Trapped within the false civility of the Camarilla and
the forced camaraderie of the Sabbat, there is a hidden
truth: Vampires are monsters, possessed of an inner
Beast. Though, like humans, they have the capability
to overrule their baser instincts, sometimes they fail.
When this occurs, the Hunger and the Beast become
uncontrollable, and no one is safe from their excesses.
Older vampires refer to the ensuing savage fits as “succumbing to the Beast Within.” Younger Kindred refer
to these outbursts simply as frenzies.

If your character falls to Maimed, she is scarred temporarily by the flames (reduce Appearance by one until

The Nature of the Beast
During a frenzy, a character literally — and usually
unwillingly — gives into the darkest instincts of the
vampiric nature. The character is consumed with rage
or hunger, unable — or unwilling — to consider the
effects of any action. Friends, foes, lovers, ethics: None
of these things matter to a vampire in frenzy. If a vampire in frenzy is hungry, he will feed from whoever is
closest without regard for the vessel’s well-being. If the
vampire is angry, he will do everything in his power
to destroy the cause of his anger. A vampire struck by
fear will commit any atrocity to remove himself from
the source of his terror, regardless of the consequences.
The character completely surrenders to the basest aspects of his Nature, shunting aside the Demeanor most
commonly presented to those around him. He is, in
short, the Beast.
In the Camarilla, succumbing to frenzy is seen as
weakness, a humiliating loss of control. Vampires who
frenzy often, and especially in public, run the risk of
social rejection or worse. Though many among the Camarilla Kindred are monsters through and through, the
laws of the Masquerade and simple civility require that
the Beast be kept in check; those who cannot do so
are not vampires, but animals, and should be put down
for the good of all. Among the Sabbat, frenzy is seen
as a natural urge, like mortals’ needs for food and sex.
Sabbat vampires deride the Camarilla’s attitude toward
frenzy as that of weak-willed fools who cannot accept
their true predatory nature. Accordingly, Sabbat typically seek not to prevent frenzy, but to control it and
use it to their advantage.
A frenzy can be induced by many things, but great
rage or hunger are the most common provocations.
It is dangerous to deny or humiliate the undead. For

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

297

this reason, vampires of the Camarilla commonly veil
slights and threats in webs of double-talk and subtlety,
lest they suddenly trigger an outburst in Elysium or conclave. Ultimately, the Storyteller can call for a vampire
to make a frenzy roll at any time, whenever he feels the
character might have cause to lose control.
A vampire in frenzy gains several temporary benefits
from the state. Vampires in frenzy completely ignore all
dice pool penalties inflicted by injury, until the frenzy
ends. Once the frenzy is finished, the pain comes back
and the crippling effects of the wounds take hold again.
All difficulties to Dominate or otherwise mentally control a frenzied character are increased by two, and all
difficulties to resist the effects of such mental control
are reduced by two. The character never needs Willpower rolls to accomplish a feat, because the rage fueling the vampire’s actions is both a catalyst to heightened state of mind and a barrier against unwanted
intrusions. Lastly, characters in frenzy are immune to
the detrimental effects of Rötschreck.

Systems
The rules for handling a frenzy are deliberately
vague, and the Storyteller is encouraged to make whatever changes she deems necessary to accommodate her
chronicle.
In some cases, Kindred can manage to overcome the
urge to frenzy. A vampire on the verge of frenzy must
make a Self-Control roll against a variable difficulty.
(Vampires with the Instincts Virtue always frenzy —
see p. 315 for more). The difficulty is often 6 to 8, but if
trying to overcome the urge to commit a blatantly evil
act, the vampire’s player can roll against a difficulty
of (9 minus Conscience) instead. The character must
score five successes to completely overcome the desires
for violence, but even one success halts the frenzy temporarily. For each success below five, the character can
resist the urge to frenzy for one turn. After this duration expires, the character may try again to gain extra
successes and thus continue to resist the frenzy. Once
five successes are acquired, over a longer or shorter period, the vampire resists the Beast’s urges.
Failure means the character goes into an emotional
rampage, doing exactly what she wants to do with no
worries of later repercussions. Botching the Self-Control roll means the character remains in a frenzy until
the Storyteller decides otherwise, and (at the Storyteller’s discretion) she may gain a derangement related
to the frenzy.

298

The following list shows common stimuli that can
incite a frenzy, and the typical difficulty for a character
to resist. If the frenzy has the potential to cause the
vampire to commit an atrocity (killing a child or other
innocent, for example), the Storyteller can rule that
the difficulty is (9 minus Conscience or Conviction)
instead.

Note: The Storyteller has final say in what can or
cannot provoke a frenzy. In some cases the Storyteller
might completely ignore what the players feel should
send their characters into a rage, and instead have some
minor event cause a frenzy. This is commonly done in
situations where the Storyteller feels a frenzy can make
a point about a character’s personality, or enhance the
events of a story.

Roleplaying Frenzy
Characters in a frenzy are not themselves — or, more
accurately, reveal more of themselves than they normally would. They will do anything to sate their hunger or destroy the source of the frenzy, even attacking
other players’ characters. Characters in a frenzy generally attack their enemies first, but if no enemies are
present, friends are perfectly acceptable fodder for their
baser instincts. Even lovers and family can fall victim
to vampires in frenzy. The character might feel remorse
and hideous guilt later, but while the frenzy occurs,
nothing matters save the immediate gratification of the
character’s desires. This can lead to subsequent degeneration checks (p. 309). Therefore, repeated frenzies

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

can prove very detrimental to a vampire’s Humanity
or Path.
Some players might feel hesitant about roleplaying a
frenzy, but such is the nature of the vampire. Players are
encouraged to portray the frenzy effectively. A player
whose character is in the midst of frenzy may choose to
spend a Willpower point. This enables him to control
one action of his character for one turn. In this manner, a vampire may give her victim-to-be a chance to
run, or an offending mortal the chance to stammer out
an apology. This moment of self-control lasts for only a
turn, possibly two; it does not stop the frenzy, but only
allows the character to control it slightly. As Storyteller, if a frenzied character takes an action you deem
inappropriate, you may allow the action, but rule that
the character has just spent a Willpower point to take
the action.
The Storyteller decides how long any frenzy lasts, but
one scene typically suffices. If a character is knocked
unconscious or trapped alone for an extended period,
the odds are good she will eventually regain control of
herself.

Rötschreck: The Red Fear
Though there are few things that can kill a vampire — and though many among the Damned claim
to loathe their immortality — certain sources of injury
frighten all vampires. Sunlight and fire can bring about
a terrified flight-or-fight mentality. While under the
spell of this Rötschreck, a vampire flees in blind panic
from the source of her fear, frantically lashing out at
anything in her way regardless of any personal attachments or affiliations. Rötschreck is in most ways similar
to any other frenzy; just as the Beast sometimes seizes
control in times of anger, so it does in times of great
fear.
Relatively innocuous stimuli, or stimuli directly
under the character’s control, are unlikely to induce
Rötschreck. For example, a character who sees a lit
cigarette in a nightclub, or a screened-in fireplace in an
ally’s home, might grow uneasy, but is unlikely to succumb to the Red Fear. If that same cigarette is pointed
threateningly at the vampire, though, or the fireplace
suddenly flares up…
A vampire seeking to avoid Rötschreck requires a
Courage roll. As with frenzy, five successes must be accumulated to ignore the Beast completely, though fewer successes enable the vampire to overcome her fear
for a greater or lesser period of time. Failure means the
vampire flees madly from the danger, making a beeline

for safety and tearing apart anything or anyone that
gets in her way. Any attempt to restrain a vampire suffering from Rötschreck results in an immediate attack,
just as if the character were in frenzy. One Willpower
point may be spent to maintain control for one turn.
A character who is the victim of a botched Courage
roll immediately frenzies and remains in a frenzy until
the Storyteller decides otherwise.

Golconda and
Other Means of Salvation
For most Kindred, to be vampire is to be eternally
Damned. Many legends speak of vampirism as the
curse not only of Caine, but of the Devil himself. To
become vampire means being forever forsaken by God
and man, and so an unlife of horror leads, at last, to an
afterlife in hell. Even those vampires who scorn such
“superstition” nonetheless see a secular hell of sorts in
their Beast, their Hunger, and the all-consuming ennui
that comes with centuries of existence.
It is not surprising, then, that some Kindred speak of
a state of being whereby they may transcend their eternal hunger and rage. Vampires who attain this state,
which is called Golconda, are said to have mastered the
Beast to such an extent that it no longer controls their
actions. While still tied to the need for blood, vampires
in Golconda need far less of it than their ravenous kin.
Moreover, they are able to quell the urges of the Beast
to such an extent that they need never fear losing control to it. They are no longer properly Kindred, but a
different, higher species of creature entirely.
As the stories go, Golconda is known only to a few
among the undead, and these no longer participate in
the Jyhad or the society of their kind. They live in the
wild places, at one with the beasts of the field and the
birds of the sky. Even the werewolves leave the masters

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

299

of Golconda be. Vampires in Golconda occasionally
enter the larger society of undead, seeking disciples
whom they can guide along the path to Golconda —
but only in secret, for they wish nothing to do with the
Jyhad. A few stories say that one of the Antediluvians
has found the path to Golconda, and that this being
seeks both to bring other Damned into Golconda’s
grace and to frustrate the schemes of its rivals. In truth,
none will — or can — say.
Among the Camarilla, Golconda is seen as a pleasant but ultimately whimsical fable — an allegory for
maintaining one’s Humanity, but nothing more than
that. Some among the Inconnu are said to possess the
secrets of Golconda, and to aid actively in its attainment — then again, there are many rumors concerning
these recluses. The Sabbat, by contrast, scorn Golconda and its seekers as unworthy vampires. Wolves, they
say, should not seek to emulate sheep.
Storytellers are free to include Golconda in their
chronicles, and players may pursue it if they choose.
Attaining Golconda, though, cannot be simulated
with charts or experience points. It is as ephemeral,
yet as powerful, as love or self-acceptance, and its attainment should be the focus of an entire chronicle. In
general, characters learn of Golconda only after spending some time among the undead, for Golconda lore is
spread in puzzling riddles and whispered from seeker to
seeker. Many vampires never hear of it at all.
Pursuit of Golconda entails not only seeking out
cryptic lore, but also seeking the truth in the vampire’s
own being. It is certain that vampires who wish to attain Golconda must feel — and display — remorse. The
greater a vampire’s sins, the greater the penance necessary. Vampires wishing to enter Golconda must seek out
the families of old victims and make amends, protect
those weaker than they, and try to make the World of
Darkness a better place. This inevitably entails maintaining one’s Humanity and spending Willpower to
commit good deeds (and avoid monstrous ones) whenever possible. (Vampires on Paths of Enlightenment are
believed to be unable to achieve Golconda.)
As mentioned, attaining Golconda should come only
at the end of a long and arduous chronicle (spanning
months, if not years, of real time). During this chronicle,
characters must meet certain criteria. They must attain
Humanity ratings of 7 or higher and Conscience ratings
of 4 or higher, and they must maintain those ratings over
lengthy periods. They must seek always to overcome the
worst effects of frenzy, fighting the urge and spending
Willpower points if necessary to avoid committing atroc-

300

ities. Moreover, they must consistently display penitent,
abstinent, and honorable behavior over dozens of stories.
Power, indiscriminate feeding, and the games of the Jyhad
are to be avoided by vampires seeking the higher path.
Typically, at about the midpoint of the chronicle,
prospective Golconda-seekers travel in search of a
mentor reputed to harbor the secrets of Golconda. If
they find a mentor, the vampires must prove themselves worthy through the undertaking of quests and
answering of riddles. Such tasks often lead the questers
through grave perils to both body and soul.
The culmination of the chronicle comes when a
worthy vampire undergoes a ritual called the Suspire.
Sometimes the vampire is approached by others already
in Golconda, who guide the vampire through the test;
other times, the mentor conducts the Suspire; still other times, the vampire travels into the wilderness and
undergoes the Suspire alone. The precise effects of the
ritual are unknown (and in the Storyteller’s hands),
save that it involves a perilous journey into the world
of dreams and, ultimately, into the vampire’s own soul.
It is extraordinarily difficult, and many vampires fail to
survive it with unlives or sanity intact. Still others return from the Suspire whole, but having forever failed
to gain Golconda. There are no second chances, and so
perhaps the lot of the latter is the most bitter of all.
Should a vampire actually gain this legendary state,
the effects are most miraculous. Foremost among them
is a total immunity to frenzy or Rötschreck. The vampire
will never again commit an evil act at the Beast’s urging
(though the player can still choose to sin, the dice will
never again force a character to do wrong). Though a
vampire in Golconda must drink vitae, he need never
fear inadvertently taking too much from a victim.
In addition, the character does not need to drink
blood as often. The character loses only one blood
point per week rather than one blood point per night.
He must still spend blood normally to power Disciplines, heal wounds, etc.
Furthermore, a vampire in Golconda partly transcends the Curse binding his own Blood to the fount
of Caine. In so doing, he may increase any Trait to as
high as 10, regardless of Generation. His blood pool
remains as it was, though.
A vampire in Golconda must maintain rigid standards of physical and mental purity. Should his Humanity rating ever slip below 7, or his Conscience rating ever fall below 4, the vampire loses all benefits of
Golconda, including heightened Traits.

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

Becoming Mortal
Besides the tales of Golconda, certain legends among
the Kindred speak of vampires who have thrown off
the Curse of Caine completely and become mortal
once more. No vampire seems to actually know any
of their kind who has done such a thing; all such tales
involve “the lover of my grandsire’s ally” or “the childe
of a distant Prince” or some other indeterminate figure.
The catalysts behind such a change can be anything
from slaying one’s sire to finding true love to sacrificing
oneself unselfishly for another (and becoming mortal
in the dying). Most Kindred, cynical and jaded as they
are, scoff at such tales — then again, acts of true love
or unselfish sacrifice in the world of the Damned are
rare indeed. Ultimately, the truth of such things is up
to the Storyteller.

Poisons and Drugs
As undead, vampires have little fear of conventional
poisons. However, they may succumb to poisons or
drugs contained within the bloodstream of their victims. Indeed, certain vampires actively seek out victims under the influence of alcohol or drugs to receive
a vicarious buzz.

Following are some examples of what might happen
if a vampire were to drink the blood of a poisoned or
drugged victim. A vampire with low Willpower (4 or
less) and/or an appropriate Nature (Bon Vivant, Child)
might risk addiction to a certain substance, but this is
unlikely. In general, the effects of most drugs on vampires are far less than their effects on humans.
• Alcohol: The vampire subtracts one from Dexterity and Intelligence dice pools for every two drinks’
worth of alcohol in his victims’ blood. This effect fades
at the rate of one die per hour, as the alcohol purges
itself from the bloodstream.
• Cocaine/meth/speed: Vampires with the Celerity
Discipline gain an extra level of the Discipline for (10
minus Stamina) minutes after drinking. Difficulties to
resist or control frenzy are increased by one.
• Hallucinogens: The vampire lowers all dice pools
by one to three (inability to concentrate). He suffers
effects similar to the Level Two Dementation power
The Haunting. Depending on the precise nature of the
“trip,” he may gain extra dice in one particular Ability (such as Awareness) or find his Auspex Discipline
raised by a dot or more. The effects last for (8 minus
Stamina) hours.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

301

• Heroin/morphine/barbiturates: The vampire subtracts two from Dexterity and all Ability dice pools for
(10 minus Stamina) minutes, and experiences a dreamlike state for (12 minus Stamina) hours. Difficulties of
frenzy rolls are decreased by one.

sunburn if they are exposed to the light of a full moon
and aren’t wearing any protective gear.

• Marijuana: The vampire experiences a slightly altered perception of time, as well as a one-die reduction
to Perception dice pools. Difficulties of frenzy rolls are
decreased by one, due to the calming effect of the drug.
The effects last for about half an hour.

• Poison: The vampire subtracts one from all dice
pools and takes from one to three levels of lethal damage per scene or even turn, depending on the intensity
of the poison. Few poisons have any real effect on the
undead, and most inflict a fixed maximum amount of
damage before wearing off. The vampire may purge the
blood at his normal expenditure rate, and the effects
heal automatically within minutes to hours after purging the blood.
• Salmonella (food poisoning): The vampire becomes nauseated, unable to consume more blood (roll
Stamina, difficulty 6, to overcome), and suffers one
health level of bashing damage. The effects last about
a day.

Sunlight
Sunlight, even more than fire, is deadly to vampires.
Even diffuse sunlight running through a heavy curtain
can cause burns, and direct sunlight sears to ash all but
the most powerful vampires. Unless a character has
Fortitude, the rays of the sun cause burns. Characters
with Fortitude (and only characters with Fortitude)
may attempt to soak sun damage, using a soak dice pool
equal to the level of the Discipline. The difficulty to
soak the damage depends on the intensity of the light,
while the amount of damage taken depends on the
amount of protection between the vampire’s skin and
the sunlight.
No part of a vampire is immune to the rays of the
sun. Any character looking into direct sunlight is
blinded instantly, her retinas burned by the illumination. Fortunately for vampires, the light reflected from
the moon is not strong enough to inflict any serious
damage, though some suffer the equivalent of mild

Temperature Extremes
Vampires, being undead, suffer little from the privations of temperature. However, very high (200+ °F or
100+ °C) temperatures might have the same effects as
fire, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Vampires suffering
from extreme cold might be forced to spend additional
blood points or suffer from the effects of frostbite (-1
or more to Dexterity-based dice pools). In general,
though, vampires should not suffer greatly from most
“normal” temperature fluctuations.

Example of Play
[Joseph has gathered Kelley, Michelle, and David together for a Vampire story. Joseph is the Storyteller.
Kelley plays Jillian Brand, a Toreador dilettante; Michelle plays DMZ, a Gangrel gangbanger/would-be
Anarch; and David plays MortyxX, a loathsome Nosferatu ex-coroner. The three have gathered to investigate strange activities in the Barrens of the inner
city, activities which have led to the disappearance
of Jillian’s sire Miranda, open warfare among DMZ’s
gangsta allies, and the firebombing of a Nosferatu tenement-aerie. The three characters, realizing that fate
has thrown them together, have agreed to meet at a
popular Kindred nightclub.]

younger Licks seeking to avoid the attentions of their
change-wary elders. Now it plays techno, or dubstep,
or whatever the children are listening to this week.
There’s the amusingly named DMZ, uncharacteristically early, face set in that sullen pout that signifies
vulnerability hidden under faux indifference. It’s only
a so-so hunting mechanism for mortals, better when
coupled with the ability to eviscerate prey with a backhand swat.

[Kelley arrives a few minutes before the other players, so, to pass the time, she and Joseph launch into
a one-on-one storytelling exercise involving Jillian’s
interaction with her herd.]

Jillian saunters over as DMZ sneers. Normally, she
loves baiting the shrill little Anarch, but she’s too
anxious about Miranda. Besides, a cursory aura-glance
reveals that the Gangrel’s not in the mood to lose a
duel of repartee, so Jillian decides to come right to the
point. “Any news on what’s up?”

An hour after sundown. Jillian lies pale and languorous on velvet sheets, entwined in the romance-novelmodel arms of Miguel, her latest doll. His mouth on
her neck is simultaneously enticing and vaguely irritating, his breath pungent and mammalian; she twists
her head about to dislodge him, presses her lips to his
waiting ones, nibbles at his lower lip and then slowly
sinks her teeth into the fleshy bit.
A sharp intake of breath — from him, not her — as
she sucks. Muttered exclamation of pain.
“There, there, sweetness,” she mutters abstractedly,
kissing the wound closed. “Such a brave lad you are.
See. Just a love bite.” She rolls up, assuming a sitting
position. This wasn’t distracting her. Images of Miranda superimposed themselves over the kine’s vapid features. “Now, M, lie back. Jill has errands to attend to
this evening. Perhaps we should rendezvous at… no, I
might be out a while. Sleep, dearest, then go home, and
I’ll call you sometime.” Miguel gives a bovine grunt of
half-conscious assent, already sinking into slumber.
[Michelle and David arrive, so Joseph and Kelley cut
their freestyle roleplay short and begin the game as a
whole.]
Jillian drives herself — even with all eternity ahead of
her, there’s nothing like effortlessly whipping a BMW
down a busy thoroughfare — to the agreed-upon spot,
valet-parks, and waves to the bouncer in lieu of paying.
Even by mortal standards, this club has seen an absurd
number of incarnations, so it’s a perfect rendezvous for

“Shit.” DMZ dry-spits in disgust at the dance floor.
“Not a goddamn one of the motherfuckers is saying
anything. All anybody knows is that some motherfuckers with extreme firepower are setting up shop, no connections to anyone known, and fuck any boundaries.”
DMZ sniffs at the air, in the manner of a dog. “I smell a
bad time rising in this city. Maybe time to move on.”
“Werewolves’d make sushi of you, flavor it with that
chip on your shoulder.” It’s MortyxX, creeping up on
them as usual, presumably just crawled up out of whatever hellhole he rested in during the day. Jillian can
barely make him out; shadows mercifully cloak the
patchwork thing he calls a body, revealing only the
odd lump or appendage bent in decidedly unnatural
fashion.
“Ahh… I thought the place smelled of formaldehyde,” Jillian mutters.
“What you smell, sweetie, is a lead as to what’s going
on, which is more than any of the rest of you’ve got. But
if you’re going to cop an attitude…” MortyxX seems to
shrug in the shadows, then turn his bulk away.
“Go on, then, Rat,” Jillian says. “Who’ll help you?
The Prince? Unlikely. The rest of your foul brood?
You’re doing this to earn status with your sewermates,
not toady to ‘em. Why don’t you just spit out what
you’ve got so we can move on?”

“Well, then. A little bird in a certain shipping company tells me that, while all this hubbub’s been going
on, trucks have been driving over to, and unloading
crates at, the Devil’s Playground — that abandoned
tenement turned squatter zone. Now what use would
a bunch of crackheads and derelicts have for crates full
of stuff — right on the borders of a war zone in your
turf, Anarch?”
“Crates of what?”
“Don’t know. Mysterious how the invoices just up
and disappeared. I caught a glimpse of some of the boxes in a temporary — sunproof — storage facility. Big
enough for weapons — or your sire, Jill, or maybe just
pieces of her.”
“That’s all you’ve got? Strictly circum—” Jillian halts
in midsentence as MortyxX holds up a distinctive purple scarf.
“Interesting how things get left lying around,” MortyxX says. “I seem to recall your sire wearing this little
trinket to one of those high-society soirees I wasn’t
invited to but crashed anyway. What’s it doing in a
rundown and dirty warehouse? And why are Kindred
being moved through the middle of a gangland battleground — unless someone’s got a decided use for something they’ve got — like their blood?”
There’s no more to say. The three leave the club and
hop in Jillian’s car. Jillian spins the BMW into town,
taking care to avoid the Avenue — where their movements will be plain as day to gossiping Harpies — and
discreetly circumventing the Five Bowers region — de
facto territory of Candlemas, a Lunatic of great age and
uncertain humors.
[Because the players state that they wish to avoid
notice from the Kindred community as a whole, the
Storyteller has Jillian roll Wits + Stealth (difficulty 5)
to avoid scrutiny. She rolls three dice for her Wits, plus
one for her Stealth rating of 1, and gets one success.]
The neighborhoods deteriorate around them —
prime Anarch hunting grounds. Jillian, not wanting to
park her car close to the Devil’s Playground or alert
anyone within the building, parks the car on a deserted side street, praying that no one trashes the vehicle
while she’s away. The three Kindred get out, walking
through an urban version of purgatory. Sirens wail in
the distance, groans echo from nearby alleyways, and
once a chopper swoops over the blighted zone.
“Nice neighborhood you live in, Z,” Jillian mutters.

304

“Fuck you, you skanky bitch!” DMZ retorts. “What
the fuck would you know about having a neighborhood, since you get handed everything on both sides
of life?”
“Oh, spare me the—” Jillian’s rebuttal is interrupted
as the disgusted MortyxX, eschewing subtlety, walks
out right under a flickering streetlight — an action,
Jillian notes, that flouts the Prince’s law more meaningfully than all of DMZ’s posturing — and brazenly
snatches a woman off the street.
[While they walk through the adjoining tenements to
the Devil’s Playground, David, realizing that MortyxX
is low on blood, asks Joseph if he can make a hunting
roll. Joseph says okay, but decides to raise the difficulty
by one — after all, MortyxX’s attention is elsewhere.
The difficulty is 5 — they’re more or less in red-light
central — and MortyxX has a Perception rating of 3.
He rolls 1, 9, 8 — one success total. Prey is in the area,
and Joseph decides to act out the hunt.]
The woman, obviously a prostitute, screeches and
beats at MortyxX’s implacable talons. “Get yer damn
hands off me, asshole. You want a blow job, it’s gonna
be—” The glassy-eyed woman catches a glimpse of
MortyxX’s lump of a face under the streetlight. “What
the fuck is that, some kinda mask, or are you just—”
“It isn’t a mask, you stupid, dead bitch,” MortyxX
hisses, and wrenches her neck with one hand. The vertebrae separate with a crack that would have churned
Jillian’s stomach in her breathing days. Pressing the
spasming body against the alley wall and the horrified
face to his own, MortyxX gnaws away at the corpse’s
skin in a parody of passion, then sucks luridly at the
tatters of the face. In the nearby buildings, lights flicker
prudently off.
[Because MortyxX so greatly overpowers his victim,
the Storyteller dispenses with combat rolls, simply allowing MortyxX to kill the girl. MortyxX still retains
Humanity, though, and murder is a gross violation of
the Hierarchy of Sins (covered in Chapter Ten). Joseph calls for David to make a Humanity roll, using
MortyxX’s Conscience rating (2) versus a difficulty
of 8. David scores 3 and 9 — one success. MortyxX is
gripped with a sense of the pointlessness of the slaughter, and will probably dream of the girl for days afterward. He does not lose a point of Humanity — this
time.]
[Figuring the woman might be on drugs or have a
disease, Joseph decides to secretly roll a die — 1 to 5,

CHAPTER SIX: SYSTEMS AND DRAMA

she’s sick or on something, 6 to 10, she’s clean. The roll
comes up 8, so MortyxX is no filthier than usual.]
Leaving the corpse twisted in a dumpster, MortyxX
leads the trio two more blocks, then motions them
around a corner. In front of them, the edifice known as
the Devil’s Playground looms against the dead gray sky.
Fires crackle on the rooftop, and laughter reverberates
from broken doorways whose gaping interiors dance
with fireflies of blue flame.
DMZ gives a long, low whistle. “My sire told me that
when the Sabbat came to his city in the ‘50s, they lit
fires everywhere. Burned the damn Primogen hall down
under cover of a race riot. Bastards love to burn shit.”
The three Kindred carefully begin walking around
the sides of the tenement, staying close to the shadows. As Jillian walks, though, her foot crunches on
something that hisses at her — a huge rat! Jillian yelps,
startled, and answering shouts echo from one of the
tenement’s broken doorways.
[The coterie decides to sneak around the sides of the
building, looking for an entrance or anything else of
relevance. MortyxX, not wishing to be invisible to his
companions, eschews Obfuscate. Joseph calls for the
trio to make Dexterity + Stealth rolls versus difficulty
7. David rolls MortyxX’s Dexterity (3) + Stealth (3)
and scores 2, 8, 4, 8, 4, 5 — two successes. Michelle
rolls DMZ’s Dexterity (4) and Wits (2) and scores 9, 1,
7, 5, 5, 5 — one success. Kelley, though, after totaling
Jillian’s Dexterity (2) and Stealth (1), rolls 1, 5, 4 — a
botch!]
Three figures emerge from the doorway, knives in
hand. The huge, shambling shapes lumber toward the
vampires, and Jillian’s Heightened Senses smell the
distinctive scent of augmented vitae characteristic of
ghouls.
[Joseph calls for Kelley, Michelle, and David to make
initiative rolls for their characters. Kelley adds Jillian’s
Dexterity (2) to her Wits (3) and rolls a die, scoring
5, for a total of 10. David totals MortyxX’s Dexterity
(3) and Wits (3), then rolls a 9, for an exceptional 16.
Michelle does the same thing for DMZ’s Dexterity (4)
and Wits (2), as well as her Celerity (1), then rolls a
7, scoring 12. Joseph, rolling for all the ghouls at once,
scores a 6 and adds it to the ghouls’ Dexterity (3) +
Wits (2). The ghouls will go on 11.]
[Now actions are declared, in reverse order of initiative. Kelley, speaking for Jillian, decides that she will
spend a blood point to raise her Stamina to 3 (a reflexive action), then use her Presence power of Dread Gaze

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

305

on the ghoul closest to her. Joseph decides that the
ghouls will split up, one ghoul for each player’s character. Michelle, for her part, says that DMZ will spend
a blood point to extrude her Talons of the Beast — an
automatic action — then launch herself at the ghoul
closest to her. Finally, David declares MortyxX’s intent to run back into a nearby alley, at which point he
hopes to be able to use his Obfuscate power of Unseen
Presence.]
MortyxX springs back toward the shadows of the
alley whence he’d just emerged, leading a ghoul in
pursuit. Snarling with fury, DMZ pounces toward another ghoul, baring fangs and claws as she leaps. Jillian,
meanwhile, composes herself, doing her best to evoke
her unearthly powers of Presence as her assailant balls
a meaty fist and shambles toward her, grinning.
DMZ and the ghoul meet in the middle of the deserted street. Ducking beneath the ghoul’s swing,
DMZ slashes frantically, and disembowels the ghoul
in one blow. The ghoul wails, a high, piercing shriek,
and drops to the ground. DMZ snarls, a predator’s cry,
and dips her fanged maw toward her fallen foe… then
thinks better of it and shakes off the haze of bloodlust.
The ghoul chasing MortyxX runs into the alley after
the Nosferatu, but sees only empty shadows. Meanwhile, Jillian stands firmly as the last creature cocks a
fist and slams it into her gut. She staggers back, but the
undead are seldom hindered by such blows. “Is that the
best you can do, sweetness?” she purrs, then contorts her
face into a mask of rage and hisses at the ghoul. Like a
building hit by a wrecking ball, the creature falls to the
ground, sobbing, in front of his much smaller assailant.
[Now the resolution phase of the turn begins. MortyxX is fastest, and he’s simply moving, so Joseph allows the action to take place unhindered. Next goes
DMZ, who activates her Protean power, moves into
combat range — without penalty, since the ghouls are
less than half his movement maximum away — and
slashes at her opponent. Michelle takes eight dice for
DMZ’s Dexterity (4) + Brawl (3) + one dot of Celerity, and rolls versus difficulty 6, scoring a 3, 1, 10, 9, 7,
4, 3, and 6. The “1” cancels out the “10,” but that still
leaves a respectable three successes. Because the ghoul
was not attempting to dodge, Michelle rolls DMZ’s
damage pool — 3 (for Strength) + 1 (for a claw) + 2
(for the extra successes over the one needed to hit).
Furthermore, because Talons of the Beast inflict aggravated damage, the ghoul cannot hope to soak the damage unless he has the Fortitude Discipline (he doesn’t).
The dice come up 10, 8, 8, 9, 6, 6! Six successes —

306

enough to drop the ghoul from Healthy to Crippled in
one strike. Though technically the ghoul is still in the
fight, Joseph decides that such damage more than suffices to dispatch the lowly minion. The ghoul sinks to
his feet, dead or soon to be.]
[However, Joseph does decide that such a quick kill
might be enough to provoke a blood-frenzy in the vampire. He tells Michelle to roll DMZ’s Self-Control rating (2) versus a difficulty of 5. Michelle rolls a 2 and 5
— one success, and barely that. DMZ manages to rein
in her Beast, but only just.]
[The ghoul chasing MortyxX continues his pursuit.
Because MortyxX reaches shadow, and Joseph thinks
it would be dramatic for him to turn the tables on his
pursuers, he tells David that he’ll allow the Obfuscate
power’s use if she makes a successful Wits + Stealth roll
(difficulty 8). David takes six dice (for MortyxX’s Wits
of 3 + Stealth of 3) and rolls 2, 1, 10, 9, 8, 6. The “1”
cancels the “10,” but David still scores two successes.
The ghoul chases MortyxX into the alley’s mouth…
and sees no one.]
[Meanwhile, the ghoul swings at Jillian, who elects
not to dodge (in hopes of making her Dread Gaze all
the more intimidating). The ghoul has a Dexterity of
3 and a Brawl of 2, so he rolls five dice versus difficulty
6 to hit. He rolls 5, 1, 9, 6, 5 — because the “1” cancels out the “9,” the ghoul scores only one success, not
enough to add damage successes to the punch. Still,
he’s a strong fellow (3) and has a dot of Potence, so
he rolls four dice for a punch. His damage roll (versus difficulty 6) comes up 7, 3, 8, 2 — three successes,
pretty good. Jillian attempts to soak and fails outright,
rolling 4, 1, 9. However, because Jillian is undead and
concussive trauma means relatively little to her, she
halves the result to one level. The punch drops her
to Bruised, but doesn’t cause her to suffer any wound
penalties. Kelley says that Jillian laughs in the ghoul’s
face, then hisses menacingly.]
[Because Jillian basically shrugged off a strong man’s
full-on punch, Joseph elects to reduce the difficulty of her
Dread Gaze roll by one. Kelley rolls Jillian’s Charisma (3)
+ Intimidation (2) versus a difficulty of only 4. She scores
3, 10, 10, 9, 6 — easily enough to cow the ghoul. The
ghoul shrieks, then drops into a fetal ball, sobbing.]
[And so the combat continues, until one side or the
other wins. Are the ghouls indeed minions of the Sabbat? Will Jill find her sire, or are they being led into an
elaborate trap? Is MortyxX trustworthy at all, or is he
stringing them along? Only a continuation of the story
will answer any of these questions.]

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

Chapter Seven:
Morality
"Rape me into ashes if you will. I can take it."
- Rachel Dolium, Revelations of the Dark Mother

Morality is integral to Vampire. “A Beast I am, lest
a Beast I become” has been an iconic phrase for the
game, and summarizes the struggle between morality and monstrosity. The curse of vampirism can strip
away the character’s mortal nature, and the character’s
Humanity is a vital part of the game. Even those Cainites who have shed their human morality to follow a
new Path of Enlightenment often do so as a specific
refutation of Humanity. A vampire without any form
of morality is nothing more than a mindless killer enslaved by her thirst for vitae, so Humanity and Paths
are an intimate part of every Vampire character. Humanity and Paths, unlike most other Traits, are rated
on a scale of 1 to 10.

Degeneration
Despite all efforts to the contrary, a vampire is going
to succumb to moral failure sooner or later in his unlife. Willfully or otherwise (ethics are particularly hard
to maintain in frenzy), a vampire occasionally commits
an atrocity and risks losing to the Beast. If the character feels remorse for his actions, he knows that his
morality is still intact. If he commits a wrongful act and

callously disregards it, however, his resistance to the
Beast is obviously waning.
One of the most important themes of Vampire is the
Kindred’s struggle to retain their souls and avoid the
clutches of the Beast. Thus, it is extremely important
to use morality in a consistent, dramatic manner. If the
Storyteller allows the players to (sometimes literally)
get away with murder, the story will suffer as one of the
tragedies of vampiric existence vanishes. If the Storyteller is too strict with the morality rules, though, all
the characters will be ravening, blood-gorged maniacs
by the end of the first session. Keeping a handle on
morality is a hard thing to do, but the degeneration
system is designed to help that. (Since most vampires
are on Humanity, from this point forward we’ll talk exclusively in those terms — special rules for those on
Paths of Enlightenment start on p. 313.)
The system is simple: Whenever a character takes
an action that the Storyteller decides is morally questionable, the character may suffer degeneration — a
permanent loss of Humanity. If degeneration is a possibility, the player whose character commits the act
should make a Conscience roll for that character. The
difficulty is 8 — reprehensible acts are hard to justify

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

309

— though the Storyteller may modify this. Willpower
may not be spent for an automatic success on this roll
— all the ego in the world won’t protect a character
from guilt.
If the player makes the roll with even one success,
the character loses no Humanity — he feels enough
remorse or somehow manages to justify his transgression. If he fails the roll, the character loses a point of
Humanity. If the player botches, the character loses
a point of both Humanity and Conscience, and also
gains a derangement, decided upon by the Storyteller.
Obviously, morality is not something a Kindred can afford to take lightly. Remember that a vampire whose
Humanity drops to zero becomes a character controlled
by the Storyteller.

(Other Paths use Hierarchies of Sin as well, though
their ideas of “sin” are different.) Whenever a character commits a dubious act, see how that action relates
to the hierarchy. If the action is at or below the level of
the character’s Humanity rating, a roll is warranted —
as a character falls further down the Humanity scale,
she becomes increasingly callous, and minor peccadilloes cease to bother her. The use of the term “violation” in the hierarchy is deliberately vague, to aid the
Storyteller. A violation may be anything questionable,
and is presented to avoid inclining the scale toward
any single transgression. Violation may be killing, callous injury, rape (what do you think taking blood by
force is?), or any other villainy.

On the Brink
A Storyteller should always warn a player before she
takes an action that may cause degeneration. Players
should understand the consequences of their characters’ actions, and should have the opportunity to enjoy
making the decision. Likewise, a player whose character is in frenzy should be told when the character is
about to do something heinous. (Remember, though,
that a player may spend a point of Willpower in order to stave off the pangs of frenzy for a turn.) Players
should not be allowed to think they can get away with
anything. Make it obvious that a roll may become necessary if vicious characters persist in committing selfcentered deeds. Likewise, don’t bait and switch. If you
warn them that a roll is imminent, go through with it,
or you risk ruining the mechanic’s usefulness.

Using Hierarchies of Sin
Degeneration checks may seem arbitrary or illdefined. To some degree, they are, but this is intentional. Moreover, degeneration checks are not random
so much as they are subjective. A Storyteller has carte
blanche to monitor character morality in her chronicle. This is a huge responsibility for the Storyteller, but
one that ultimately makes for a great deal of tragedy
and horror, as the characters gradually descend into
a state of utter monstrosity though they desperately
rail against it. Storytellers, beware — players should
never feel that you are screwing them out of Humanity or, consequently, their characters. Use degeneration checks consistently but sparingly, lest the tragedy
erode to an incessant series of failed die rolls.

Bearing
A vampire’s morality has a direct impact on
her bearing — a feeling the Kindred unconsciously projects. The greater the vampire’s
Humanity or Path rating, the stronger this tendency is. For example, vampires on Humanity
have a bearing of normalcy; the humane connection that such vampires hold keeps them
from seeming strange and terrifying to mortals.
Generally, a vampire’s bearing has little or no
direct effect on her nightly activities — it’s
only a vague impression. Very high or low
morality ratings impose a bonus or penalty to
specific rolls associated with the character’s
bearing — for Humanity, the bearing modifier
affects Social rolls for appearing normal and
winning sympathy. These modifiers can affect
rolls used for Disciplines, where relevant. Paths
of Enlightenment have their own bearings,
which are listed with each Path description.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

It seems hard to slide to the lowest echelons of the
scale, but consider the prominence of the Beast as Humanity falters. Sooner or later, the character will be
committing depravity outside her own volition. The
Storyteller is free to decree that characters of low Humanity (4 or less) occasionally act according to various urges and impulses that must be resisted with Conscience rolls or Willpower expenditure. This is the crux
of Vampire — how closely can the character walk with
the Beast before it drags her into damnation?

Humanity
Let’s make one thing clear: just because a vampire
follows the Path of Humanity doesn’t mean she is a
friendly, congenial saint. Vampires are predators by nature, and Humanity only gifts them with the ability to
pretend they’re not. It is an internal charade that protects a Kindred from herself, much as the Masquerade
protects vampires from the mortals outside.
Unfortunately, the very nature of existence as a vampire is anathema to one’s Humanity. As the centuries
wear on, the Beast takes hold, and Kindred become less
and less concerned with the wellbeing of the kine (after
all, they’ll die eventually, anyway). As such, characters
are likely to lose Humanity over the course of the game.
Mortals also typically follow the Path of Humanity, though this is largely out of ignorance: They don’t
know they can be anything else. As such, this mechanical system for morality rarely comes into play for them.
Certainly, some mortals — rapists, murderers, and the
like — have low Humanity ratings, but they have no
Beast roiling within them, as do the Kindred. It is possible for a vampire with a high Humanity rating to be
more humane than some mortals are!

Effects of Humanity
A Kindred’s Humanity rating reflects how much of a
character’s mortal nature remains despite the curse of
Caine. It influences how well a character may deny her
vampiric state, as well as how effectively she may pass
for mortal.
• Vampires sleep unnaturally deeply and are loath
to rise even if presented with danger. Vampires with
higher Humanity rise earlier in the evening than vampires with lower Humanity ratings. Also, if a Kindred
is forced to act during the day, the maximum dice pool
he may employ for any action is equal to his Humanity
rating.
• Humanity also affects a character’s Virtues. Whenever a certain Virtue is called into question, a player
may not roll more dice for a Virtue than her character
has dots in Humanity. Obviously, as the character sinks
ever more deeply into the arms of damnation, questions
of morality and self-preservation mean less and less. As
Humanity depletes, the character creeps slowly toward
the night when she loses all self-control.
• The length of time a Kindred spends in torpor
(p. 283) relates directly to his Humanity rating. A vampire with low Humanity remains in torpor for a longer
time than a vampire with a higher Humanity rating.
• Humanity determines how human a character appears and how easily she may pass among the populace.
Vampires with low Humanity acquire unnatural and
disturbing features like sunken eyes, perpetual snarls,
and bestial countenances (a reflection of the vampire’s
bearing — see the sidebar on the previous page).
• If a character’s Humanity rating ever drops to zero,
that persona is no longer suitable for use as a player’s
character. Completely controlled by his Beast, the
character is mindless and falls under the Storyteller’s
control.
Humanity ratings fluctuate based upon the Hierarchy of Sin — if a vampire accidentally or purposefully
commits an act rated lower than her Humanity rating,
she must roll her Conscience Trait to see whether she
accepts the act (and thus loses Humanity) or feels remorse and maintains her current level. Humanity may
be raised only by spending experience points on it.

The Downward Spiral
Vampires are monsters, and even a Kindred with
the highest of Humanity ratings is nothing more than
a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Nonetheless, as Human-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

311

ity erodes, vampires not only become capable of, but
also actively pursue, ever more depraved acts. It is in a
vampire’s nature to hunt and kill, and eventually every
vampire finds himself holding the corpse of a vessel he
had not intended to murder.
It is important, then, to know how vampires change
as their Humanity ratings deteriorate. Vampires’ behavior, even under the auspices of Humanity, may
become so utterly depraved and alien that the very
thought of her causes discomfort in others. After all, a
low Humanity rating indicates that very little connects
the Kindred with her mortal origins.

Humanity 10-8
Kindred with Humanity ratings this high are, ironically, more human than human. Many fledgling vampires sometimes adhere to codes more rigorous than
they ever held in life, as a reaction against becoming a
predator. Older Kindred scoff at this practice, laughing
at the thought of newly whelped neonates cowering
beneath fire escapes and subsisting on the foul blood of
rats, vainly rebelling against their murderous natures.
In truth, vampires who maintain high ratings in Humanity are rare, as every Kindred must kill sooner or

later. Vampires with high Humanity are almost unbearable by their peers, who find frustration in their
perceived naiveté and self-righteousness; most Kindred
prefer to suffer through unlife without kicking themselves. High Humanity ratings indicate aversion to
killing and even distaste for taking more vitae than is
necessary. Though not necessarily passive or preachy,
Kindred with high Humanity uphold excruciatingly
exacting standards, and often have very clearly defined
concepts of moral right and wrong.

Humanity 7
Most human beings have Humanity ratings of 7 or
so, so vampires at this level of Humanity can usually
manage to pass for mortals. Vampires with 7 Humanity
typically subscribe to “normal” social mores — it’s not
acceptable to hurt or kill another person, it’s wrong to
steal something that another person owns, but sometimes the speed limit is just too damn slow. The vampire is still concerned with the natural rights of others
at this stage of morality, though more than a little selfishness shines through.

Humanity 6-5
People die. Stuff breaks. A vampire below the cultural human norm has little difficulty with the fact that
she needs blood to survive, and she does what needs
to be done to get it. Though she won’t necessarily go
out of her way to destroy property or end a victim’s
life, she accepts that sometimes that’s what fate has
in store for some folks. Though not constantly horrid,
Kindred at this stage of Humanity are certainly at least
mildly unpleasant to be around. Their laissez-faire attitudes toward others’ rights offend many more moral
individuals.

Humanity 4
The vampire begins an inevitable slide into urge
indulgence. A Humanity of 4 indicates that killing is
acceptable to this Kindred, so long as his victim is “deserving.” Many vampire elders hover around this level
of Humanity, if they haven’t adopted some other moral
code. Destruction, theft, injury — these are all tools,
rather than taboos, for a vampire with Humanity 4.
The vampire’s own agenda becomes paramount at this
point, and screw whoever gets in the way.

Humanity 3-2
The lives and property of others are irrelevant to
a Kindred this far gone. The vampire likely indulges
twisted pleasures and aberrant whims, which may in-

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

clude any manner of atrocity. Perversion, callous murder, mutilation of victims, and wickedness for its own
sake are the hallmarks of a Kindred with very low Humanity. Few vampires maintain ratings this low and
lower for very long — their damnation is all but certain
at this point. Physical changes show up at this stage;
while not hideous in the sense of the Nosferatu or certain Gangrel, the vampire acquires a pallid, corpselike,
and noticeably unwholesome aspect.

with the mores of mortal culture. Adopting a Path of
Enlightenment means giving up everything that matters to a “normal” person (or indeed, many vampires).

Humanity 1

• Paths are exclusive. Few Kindred are initiated into
the secrets of the Paths. Most vampires — even those
of the independent Clans and the Sabbat — follow the
ways of Humanity; they simply tend to degenerate to
very low levels over time. Not just anyone can follow
a Path; becoming such an inhuman creature requires
discipline and spiritual strength, albeit of a distinctly
alien sort. A person seeking to join a Path must have
the capacity to discard her human nature, as well as the
fortitude to survive the process.

Only nominally sentient, Kindred with Humanity 1
teeter on the edge of oblivion. Little matters to vampires this far gone, even their own desires outside of
sustenance and rest. There is literally nothing a vampire with Humanity 1 won’t do, and only a few tattered
shreds of ego stand between him and complete devolution. Many who attain this stage find themselves no
longer capable of coherent speech, and spend their
nights gibbering blasphemy in their gore-spattered havens.

Humanity 0
Must sleep. Must feed. Must kill. Players may not run
characters with Humanity 0. Vampires at this stage are
completely lost to the Beast.

Alternate Virtues
and Paths of
Enlightenment
Some vampires forgo the petty mortal concerns embodied by the concept of Humanity. These Kindred
reason that they are no longer human, so they have
no need to apply the sentiments of the living to themselves.
Whether or not a Kindred chooses to follow the moral tenets of Humanity, some sort of behavioral system
must exist. To accept utter randomness is to invite the
Beast to rule, and no vampire wishes to sink into the
clutches of mindless depravity. Even those vampires
who plumb the depths of immorality have some ethical bulwark they use to anchor themselves against the
Beast.
Kindred who voluntarily abandon Humanity follow
behavioral codes known as Paths of Enlightenment.
While mechanically similar to Humanity, these codes
have very little — in fact, sometimes nothing — to do

Only those Cainites who have truly abandoned
themselves to the dark majesty of vampirism follow
Paths, and rarely do any turn back. Players may choose
between a variety of different Paths (at the Storyteller’s
discretion). It is important to know a few things before
you commit to a Path of Enlightenment, however.

• Paths are utterly inhuman. Players wishing their
characters to adopt Paths of Enlightenment are in for
extremely demanding roleplaying experiences. These
are codes of immortal ethics that Kindred have spent
hundreds of years, if not millennia, studying. It’s fine
and good to have a Lasombra character following the
Path of Night, but the player will have to devote an
enormous amount of energy toward understanding
how that character really thinks.
• Paths shock conventional moralities. Paths use
game systems similar to Humanity, but the codes that
constitute these ideas emphasize such alien ideals that
mortal characters observing an adherent is likely to be
put off. Some codes espouse killing, while others cannot be bothered with it. Indeed, some codes are so selfish that even thinking about helping others constitutes
a moral failure.
These Paths are here to illustrate how utterly inhuman and removed the Kindred are from humankind,
and to give them spiritual protection from the talons
of the Beast. Use the Paths when the story or character
demands them, not to free the characters from penalties for wanton murder or perversion.

Systems
Characters on Paths of Enlightenment use the same
systems for degeneration as characters who still subscribe to Humanity. Each Path has its own Hierarchy
of Sin, which functions the same as the one on p. 312.
Some Paths are so far removed from conventional hu-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

313

man morality that concepts like Conscience and SelfControl do not apply to them at all. For these codes of
ethics, different Virtues apply. Depending upon which
Path a character follows, Conscience may be replaced
by the Virtue of Conviction, while Self-Control may
be replaced by the Virtue of Instinct. No character
may have both Conscience and Conviction or SelfControl and Instinct. Which Virtues the character actually possesses depends upon which Path he follows.
Remember, however, that all characters have Courage,
regardless of Path.

Conviction
The Conviction Virtue quantifies a character’s ability to maintain a sense of reason when faced with desire, suffering, or need. Conviction represents the reconciliation of the predatory urge with the character’s
capacity for atrocity.
As opposed to Conscience, which deals with remorse
and atonement for Path transgressions, a character
with Conviction recognizes his failure and plans to
overcome it. Conviction is completely inhuman; the
character who has this Trait can no longer pass for human under anything but the most cursory of scrutiny.
Creatures who can sense the Beast (vampires, were-

314

wolves, etc.) immediately recognize someone with the
Conviction Virtue for what he truly is: a monster. Like
Conscience, Conviction comes into question when a
character must check for degeneration.

Instinct
The Instinct Virtue refers to a character’s ability to
control the Beast by familiarity rather than denial. It
allows characters to “ride the wave” of frenzy and emotional excess by keeping a close rein on their passion,
rather than letting passion control them. As atavistic
as Conviction, Instinct is the Virtue of a monster who
accepts his nature rather than maintaining a sense of
human compassion.
Instinct allows the character to harness the Beast’s
destructive power; a character with high Instinct is
primal and turbulent. A player rolls Instinct when
attempting to control a character’s existing frenzy.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

When a character who possesses the Instinct Virtue
faces frenzy, she always enters the frenzy, unless the
difficulty to avoid it is less than her Instinct Trait, in
which case she may choose whether or not to frenzy.
Thereafter, for the duration of the frenzy, the character
is wholly under the Beast’s sway, and must be run by the
player (or controlled by the Storyteller) in an appropriate fashion. Any time the player wishes the character
to consciously take an action (known as “riding the
wave”), she must roll Instinct against the difficulty to
avoid the frenzy. Frenzies affect the character normally
(including ignoring wound penalties, etc.), though she
may sometimes exert a bit of control while so enraged.

not be spent to increase a beginning character’s Path
rating above 5, either. Beginning character vampires
who subscribe to these codes still have only 25 or fewer
years of experience as Kindred — hardly enough time
to master the rigors of inhuman codes of behavior.
(Players starting with older characters may start with
increased Path ratings at Storyteller discretion.)
• In all other ways, unless otherwise specified, inhuman Paths and Virtues are used like their human
counterparts. So, if a roll calls for the player to use Perception + Self-Control, and the character has Instinct,
roll Perception + Instinct. Mechanically the Virtues
often fulfill the same purpose, even if some of the application differs.

Switching from Humanity
to a Path

Creating a Path Follower
If a player wishes to create a beginning character on
a Path, a few changes in the character-creation rules
take place.
• Alternate Virtues begin at zero: While every human (and thus every recently Embraced Kindred) has
a modicum of their “natural” Virtues, vampiric Virtues
must be learned from the ground up. So, while a character with Conscience, Self-Control, and Courage is created with one free dot in each Virtue, then has seven
points to spend on Virtues, a character with Conviction, Self-Control, and Courage begins with only two
free dots (in Self-Control and Courage). A character
with Conviction, Instinct, and Courage begins with
only one free dot (in Courage). All characters receive
seven points to spend, but must use points to buy the
inhuman Virtues to at least 1. This may seem unfair,
but shunting off one’s human nature is not undertaken
lightly. Even monsters are not created overnight.
• A vampire following a Path of Enlightenment must
begin the game with a Willpower Trait of 5, minimum:
This can be achieved by spending points on Courage or
raising Willpower with freebie points. Beings of lesser ego
simply do not have the spiritual vigor needed to break
down their souls and rebuild them from the ground up.
• Beginning characters may not start the game with
Path ratings above 5: If the combination of the character’s Virtues would indicate a Path rating of higher
than 5, simply record “5.” Likewise, freebie points may

A character may also elect to eschew his human nature in favor of a Path. This is exceedingly difficult,
and those who fail find themselves permanently soulscarred as a result.
A character seeking to switch from Humanity to a
Path must have a Humanity rating of 3 or below, as
well as ratings of 1 in whichever Virtue or Virtues are
to change to their counterparts. For example, a vampire seeking to follow a Path espousing Conviction and
Instinct must have Conscience and Self-Control ratings of 1.
During the chronicle, a candidate is typically approached by a Kindred already on the Path; in this
sense, Paths resemble secret fraternal orders, approaching candidates they deem worthy rather than being
open to solicitation. This process should be roleplayed.
If the character chooses to initiate himself toward the
Path, he begins a program of rigorous study, and a vampire already on the Path is assigned as the initiate’s
mentor. An initiate spends at least a year in contemplation and study of the Path’s ways. During this time,
the initiate must forcibly degenerate his human Virtues, dropping them to “acceptable” levels (Humanity
3 or below, ratings of 1 in appropriate Virtues), if he
has not done so already.
The vampire then undertakes a test, which can be
roleplayed by the player and Storyteller. This test can
involve study of forbidden lore, answering of riddles,
completion of ordeals and tasks, or whatever else the
Storyteller deems appropriate for the given Path. However, part of the test always involves the vampire committing an act that, in human terms, would be viewed

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

315

as an atrocity. Such a deed is undertaken not for the
sake of mindless evil, but rather to impart a lesson
about the character’s nature in relation to the Path.
Following the completion of the test, the character
makes a Willpower roll. If the character’s Humanity is
3, the difficulty of the roll is 8. If the character’s Humanity is 2, the difficulty is 7, and if the character’s
Humanity is 1, the difficulty is 6. Willpower may not
be spent to gain automatic successes on this roll. If the
character succeeds, he sheds his human nature and the
Virtues that accompany it, gains ratings of 1 in all appropriate Path Virtues, and gains a Path rating of 1. If
the character earns three or more successes, he experiences a profound (if twisted) enlightenment, gaining a
Path rating of 2.
If the character fails the roll, he commits a stupid,
pointless atrocity without gaining any corresponding
understanding. He loses a point of Humanity, fails to
attain the rudiments of the Path, but may reattempt the
test (at a difficulty appropriate to his lowered Humanity Trait) in a month’s time. If the character botches
the roll, he loses a point of Humanity and may not reattempt the test for an entire year.
Should a character be driven to Humanity zero in
this fashion, his soul is lost to the Beast, and the character is permanently taken over by the Storyteller.

The Path of Blood
Nickname: Dervishes
Virtues: Conviction and Self-Control
Bearing: Resolve. Followers of the Path of Blood
know the seriousness of their task and are incredibly
dedicated to it. Their aura modifier affects Willpower
rolls.
Basic Beliefs: This Path is practiced almost exclusively by the assassins of Clan Assamite, although only
vampires who demonstrate true loyalty to the Clan
learn its harsh code. The founding principle of this
Path explains that the children of Caine (or Khayyin,
as the Assamites refer to him) are wicked failures, fit
primarily to bring the brood of Haqim (the Assamites’
name for their own Clan founder) closer to “the One,”
a state of mystical transcendence. Haqim instructs
his childer to salvage or strike down Khayyin’s other
childer to destroy the taint they inflict on the world.
Assamites on this Path follow two basic precepts.
First and foremost, the Clan seeks to convince other

316

Kindred of their flawed, cursed nature, and thus convert them to the service of those on the Path. Kindred
as a whole are a blight upon the earth, and only by upholding Haqim’s righteous code can they redeem themselves. Should vampires resist attempts at conversion,
the Assamites kill them. Before they were cursed, Assamites would diablerize their victims, using the blood
of the fallen to lower their Generations and thus return
to Haqim’s bounty. Now, unable to drink the blood of
other vampires, they instead collect blood from vampires as payment, using that to follow Haqim’s directives until the night when the curse upon them can
be lifted. Although they are not inherently psychotic
murderers, Assamites on the Path of Blood place little
value on the unlives of other Kindred, and must have
good reason not to slay most vampires with whom they
come in contact. Vampires on this Path pose a serious
threat to other Kindred around them, and do not frequently associate with non-Assamite Kindred. Blood is
blood, however, and Assamites are not so fatuous as to
disregard the value of the vast web of Kindred society.
Few young Assamites follow this Path or even know
of its existence — Clan Assamite conspires to keep its
beliefs secret from most other Kindred of the world.
Hundreds of years ago, the Assamites’ bloodthirsty
ways united all other Children of Caine against them,
and they are loath to face the concerted opposition of
Khayyin’s bastard brood again. As such, only the most
accomplished and able Assamites learn this Path’s tenets.

The Ethics of the Path
• Faithfully follow the teachings of Haqim.
• Mortals are beneath the notice of vampires. Feed
from them only when necessary.
• Lose no opportunity to obtain Kindred blood of
any Generation. The power of the Blood shall ensure
the clan’s victory.
• Withstand the Beast’s fury — failing to master
oneself results in lessened prowess.
• Seek knowledge that may aid the Clan in its war
on the cursed spawn of Khayyin.
• Extend the glory of Haqim’s cause to other Kindred. Should they refuse, use them to further your own
journey back to Khayyin’s grace.

History
The Assamites practiced an early version of this
Path for hundreds of years before the formations of
the Camarilla and Sabbat. Their bloodlust led them

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

into open conflict with powerful elder Kindred, who
desperately sought to stifle the marauding diablerists.
The Assamites found themselves in the same situation
as the Anarchs during the time of the Anarch Revolt,
and the Camarilla levied a curse on the Clan, making
it impossible for the Assamites to consume Kindred vitae. For centuries, the Clan have followed a debased
version of the Path, crippled by its members’ inability
to commit diablerie directly.

Current Practices
The fatal nature of this Path with regard to other
Kindred stands behind much of the fear and mistrust
of Clan Assamite. Predominantly practiced by proven
ancillae and elders of the Clan, the Path of Blood leads
these beings into direct conflict with non-Assamite
vampires. Kindred on the Path of Blood gracefully attempt to convince other Kindred of their “one true
way,” so a few individuals from other Clans also support this Path.
Practitioners of little understanding seek merely
to follow the teachings of Haqim, doing so without

question. However, those of greater wisdom seek to
explore just what “becoming One” entails. By taking
the cursed blood of the Antediluvians and their spawn,
the followers of the Path hope to concentrate the curse
of Khayyin in the hands of those who will use it responsibly (namely, the Assamite Clan). In such a way,
according to Path doctrine, can the great endgame of
Gehenna be averted. Accordingly, Assamite Ancients
practice rigorous purity and meditation, and rumors of
a Golconda-like state among these beings have recently trickled into the larger Kindred community.

Description of Followers
Study, proselytism, and selective strikes against the
rest of the Kindred world occupy the nights of Kindred
on this Path. Fanatical in their quest, the Assassins
bring Final Death to those who would get in the way of
collecting the blood payments or sending a portion of
those payments back to their sires and leaders in Alamut. Mostly, however, Assamites seek to convert those
of high Generation, as they are farther removed from
their progenitors and, thus, the taint of evil.

Following the Path
This Path espouses the liberal practice of Kindred
murder and the acquisition of blood. More enlightened
Kindred on the Path of Blood also seek to uncover lore
and knowledge that may lead them to a key to remove
the Tremere ritual that cripples them. As such, vampires who follow the Path of Blood are not mindless
monsters murdering Kindred in the streets, but wouldbe saviors of the entire world. All Kindred on the Path
of Blood strive to attain “Oneness” with the mythical
Haqim, though few who have reached this lofty goal
deign to explain its nature. Most Dervishes believe
that Oneness resembles Golconda, or another state
wherein vampires can cast off their curse and revel in
their Cainite natures.
Common Abilities: Combat and occult Abilities
aid followers in their pursuit of the Path’s principles.
Athletics, Brawl, Melee, Intimidation, and Occult are
among the Abilities prized by Path of Blood supporters.
Preferred Disciplines: This Path lends itself to the
refinement of Quietus, Obfuscate, and Celerity. Some
followers cultivate knowledge of Thaumaturgy to aid
them in their quests.

Path of Blood, Post-Curse
If you are playing an Assamite who is not
under the effects of the Tremere ritual (and
thus, using the weakness listed in the sidebar
on p. 428), the Path of Blood demands that
the Dervish must diablerize Kindred when
they have the opportunity instead of sharing
their payments of blood with the Clan. As
such, the 4 rating for the Hierarchy of Sin is
replaced with “Failing to pursue lesser blood,”
and the 2 rating is replaced with “Failing to
take an opportunity to lower one’s
Generation.”

The Path of the Bones
Nickname: Gravediggers
Virtues: Conviction and Self-Control
Bearing: Silence. The Gravediggers, accustomed as
they are to long hours of quiet study and contemplation of the grave, radiate the stillness of death. The
bearing modifier applies to rolls involving Stealth and
attempts to go unnoticed.
Basic Beliefs: The Path of the Bones, it is believed,
grew out of a warped code upheld by the morbid vampires who sired the Giovanni: Human, Kindred, or otherwise, every being sooner or later ends up in death’s
arms. The most ardent followers of this Path espouse
“giving oneself over to the comprehension of life’s inevitable end.” Vampires who follow this Path seek the
knowledge of precisely what death is: Is it simply the
end of life? The transition of the soul to what lies after
life? Is it the end of the soul’s desire to exist? These
questions haunt the followers of the Path of the Bones
each night.
Many vampires believe that the Path of the Bones is
a degenerate Path that encourages followers to participate in all manner of murder and deviance. Those who
uphold the Path and those who are familiar with it,
however, know that it involves itself with a pursuit of
life’s — and unlife’s — meaning. Followers of the Path
seek to understand death’s nature and purpose, and
thus the roles individuals play in the greater scheme of
the world. Mortality is inevitable, except for vampires,
who have somehow managed to cheat the cycle.
Kindred nature, however, is generally outside the avenues this Path explores. It is truly a scholar’s code, as
the Kindred who follow it forsake even their own comfort to advance their understanding of mortality’s mysteries. These Kindred are not necessarily cruel — they
merely value comprehension more than human life.
At its simplest, the Path of the Bones seeks to define
not only what death is, but also its meaning to those
who have escaped it. It is a Path of knowledge and
power, and many who support it learn to wield great
influence over the living and dead alike. Many among
the Path become quite erudite in the ways of ghosts,
but even these odd beings fail to answer many of the
Gravediggers’ questions — what, for example, happens
to a ghost that resolves its psychic struggle or discorporates into the void?

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

The Ethics of the Path
• Study death in all its permutations.
• Determine when death occurs; define it.
• Search for a purpose for death and the life that
prefaces it.
• Quantify the differences of death by various
causes.
• Achieve a comfort with death and unlife — distinguish between damnation and salvation.
• Hasten death’s arrival, should it seem to be unnaturally delayed.

History
This Path grew out of a moral code upheld by the
Cappadocians, whom the Giovanni destroyed in their
bid for greater power. A select few Giovanni saw more
than a means to an end in their practice of Necromancy, and upheld the rituals and studies of their forebears.
Although the Path is not widely practiced among the
Clan, followers of its precepts pioneered most of the
Giovanni’s advances in Necromancy.

Current Practices
Elder members of Clan Giovanni follow this Path, as
do those with a sincere interest in improving their nec-

romantic knowledge for a purpose other than temporal
power. Giovanni who uphold the Path of the Bones
rarely deal with mortals, as their grim inquisitiveness
often proves fatal for mortals with whom they come in
contact.

Description of Followers
Vampires on this Path are genuinely curious, wishing
to learn exactly what purpose individuals serve. Thanatology is more a science than a philosophy to Kindred
on the Path of the Bones. This Path is quite introspective, and greedy Giovanni rarely follow it, preferring
the more materially comfortable outlook of Humanity. Gravediggers support the Giovanni family primarily through the knowledge they bring it, rather than
through advancing the political aims of the Clan.

Following the Path
Vampires who subscribe to the tenets of the Path
of the Bones should be detached yet inquisitive. Although they are not cavalier about death, Gravediggers
seldom aid anyone about to die, preferring to watch
and learn. Less fatalistic vampires may take issue with
this, and the Kindred on this Path will not act against
them should they seek to aid the dying individual. Obviously, their time has not yet come.

Common Abilities: Kindred on this Path naturally
specialize in those proficiencies that advance their macabre research. Knowledges are favored, particularly in
the realms of Medicine, Occult, and Science.
Preferred Disciplines: Followers of this Path obviously favor Necromancy, and also refine their aptitude
with Auspex. As well, certain elders of the Path are
rumored to have developed unique mystic arts related
to the study of death.

Path of Death and the Soul
During the formation of the Sabbat, the
Tzimisce took similar inspiration from the
Cappadocians and created a variant Path
called Death and the Soul. The Sabbat claim
their version of the Path is distinct, but most
outside observers have difficulty telling the
difference between adherents of Path of the
Bones and Path of Death and the Soul. As
such, the mechanics for both Paths are functionally identical.

The Path of Caine
Nickname: Noddists
Virtues: Conviction and Instinct
Bearing: Faith. The righteousness of the Cainite is
apparent to all. The bearing modifier affects all rolls
that rely on the vampire’s image as a devout Kindred
and scholar of Caine’s teachings.
Basic Beliefs: Scholars of nights long past, in seeking keys to the nature of vampiric existence, pursued
fragments of knowledge from the Book of Nod. Drawing
upon the history from that book as well as other esoteric sources, Cainite scholars concluded that only Caine,
as the first vampire, is the paragon of vampiric nature.
The Noddists seek to become more like Caine, in order
to discover the limits and powers of the undead form.
By learning from Caine’s example, the Noddists claim,
one can understand the true nature of vampirism and
how vampiric existence differs from one’s mortal life.
Noddists seek knowledge and history, recording the
experiences of Caine, so that they may learn from his

320

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

example. To them, Caine’s life reveals the mystery of
the vampiric curse; by understanding the undead form,
they transcend their mortal weaknesses. They prize any
knowledge about the vampiric condition, but the writings and stories of the First Vampire form the core of
Noddist lore. As Caine was marked and cast out from
mortal society, the Noddists believe that he exemplifies
most keenly the differences between vampires and humans. Therefore, this Path‘s adherents cast aside their
humanity as inadequate and useless, emulating Caine’s
exile and seeking new rules to govern their predatory
drives.
The heart of the Path of Caine lies in the exemplification of vampiric nature: The questions of existence, the limits of the vampiric form and the changes
wrought by the Embrace all drive the Noddists into
endless speculation, debate, and research. Scholarship
and historical insight are valuable, but the vampire
must simultaneously develop spiritually and physically, to explore the limits of his undead form. Diablerie
serves as more than a simple theft of power; it allows
the practitioner to learn from the experiences of other
undead, thereby developing greater understanding.
Other vampires lose themselves in attempts to save
lost humanity or find meaning in obscure philosophy.
The Path of Caine, instead, finds meaning in the fundamentals of vampirism.
The Path of Caine is demanding and rigorous; few
vampires follow its tenets in the modern nights. This
Path places a high emphasis on scholarship, insight,
and personal discipline. With the eternal patience attributed to Caine, say the followers of the Path, comes
the opportunity to slowly refine oneself.

The Ethics of the Path
• Search for the history of Caine. Learn from his actions.
• Develop your willpower and predatory instinct.
The Beast, like the rest of the vampiric form, may be
mastered.
• Take the vitae of the unworthy so that you may
become closer to Caine. Temper this accrual with an
understanding of your own potential so that you do not
take the Curse for granted.
• Adapt to the needs of your new condition; cast
aside your lost humanity.
• Study your abilities and the abilities of Caine to
discover what belongs within you. Examine the limits
and meanings of vampirism.

History
The Path of Caine developed in the early 16th century as vampires sought new insights into personal enlightenment during the Renaissance. Many vampires
felt the need for a system of self-improvement that
circumvented the limitations of humanistic beliefs, as
human morality conflicted with vampiric nature. This
Path gained a great following over the next 200 years,
as many vampires viewed Caine as an ideal figure. Following the Enlightenment, this Path began to decline
in favor of newer Paths. Few vampires maintained the
discipline and studiousness necessary to uphold this
Path, so it dwindled to a small but devoted following.
The remaining Noddists maintained a respected place
in the Sabbat and continued to recruit from the most
intellectual and insightful prospects. As the modern
Sabbat selects more fledglings based on their individual
potential and achievement, this Path has experienced
an influx of new followers.

Current Practices
This Path appeals to some of the most introspective
and reflective of vampires, but all Sabbat subscribe to
parts of the theory (if not the practice) of this Path.
Followers focus on personal growth, but also lead missions to garner hidden knowledge and powerful elder
vitae. Additionally, many of this Path‘s students often
oversee and participate in rituals and plays celebrating the history of vampirism. Noddists are loath to
Embrace randomly, instead choosing recruits from
promising mortals. Recently, many Noddists have eschewed scholarship in favor of traveling, experiencing
the world and emulating Caine’s wanderings. Many of
these “adventurous” Noddists travel the globe to chase
bits of information and experience the variety of vampiric existence.

Description of Followers
Noddists are often reserved and educated, with a
strong knowledge of history and a drive for self-awareness. Followers of the Path are not inquisitive in the
sense of seeking deductive answers to problems; rather,
they study traditions and historical events in hopes of
finding solutions for their questions. Cainites who espouse this Path often display a great deal of self-mastery. Additionally, Noddists tend to engage in debate
with other vampires, to discern how other Cainites experience the Curse. Noddists tend to assume positions
of spiritual authority in the Sabbat, as Pack Priests or
Bishops. Many other Cainites find followers of this
Path haughty and vain.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Following the Path
Sons and Daughters of Caine should always seek information regarding the vampiric condition, through
experience, personal growth, and the pursuit of occult lore. Diablerie, development of Disciplines, and
self-mastery are all valid means of refining the vampiric form. Noddists rarely engage in politics, choosing
instead to acquire new information and experiences.
They also serve as priests who lead vampires to seek
awareness — and development — of their undead condition. Those on this Path lead by example, embracing
their monstrous natures and striving to attune themselves to their differences from humans, then helping
other vampires do the same. Noddists do not hesitate
to share their insights, so that all vampires have the
opportunity to become closer to Caine, though they
hoard dangerous secrets to prevent misuse.
Common Abilities: Vampires who adhere to the
Path of Caine are studious and philosophical. Follow-

ers primarily favor Knowledges — especially Occult —
but Noddists are expected to be capable of developing
the vampiric form to its greatest potential, so Survival,
Melee, and Athletics are encouraged. Additionally,
those who would engage in debate prefer Expression,
Subterfuge, and Leadership.
Preferred Disciplines: Followers of the Path of
Caine prefer those Disciplines considered “natural” to
vampires, such as Auspex and Presence. Disciplines
that augment the physical form — Celerity, Fortitude,
and Potence — are particularly valuable. Some Noddists dislike the use of Disciplines that are not expressly
noted in the Book of Nod, such as Thaumaturgy and
Serpentis, claiming that these Disciplines do not conform to Caine’s development. Other followers of the
Path claim that such Disciplines simply represent a
heightened mastery of the vampiric condition. Most
Cainites of this Path learn only the Disciplines listed
by Caine in the early fragments of the Book of Nod.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

The Path of Cathari
Nickname: Albigensians
Virtues: Conviction and Instinct
Bearing: Seduction. The Cathari are temptation incarnate, and they have an uncanny knack for knowing
the desires of others. The bearing modifier affects rolls
to tempt and seduce others.
Basic Beliefs: The Path of Cathari sprang from the
Catharist heresy of the Middle Ages. A dualistic philosophy, Cathar doctrine holds that the world was created in equal parts by a good (“light”) creator responsible for virtue and spirit, and an evil (“dark”) creator
who fashioned the material world and its vices. The
original Cathars believed the soul to be the root of all
that is pure in humanity, while the material body was
a shell in the corrupt physical world. Cathars pointed
to the noble aspects of the spirit — compassion, sacrifice, honesty, and the like — as proof that the only
true good lay in the ephemeral. The material world,
with its suffering and misery, bore obvious flaws and
imperfections. After much persecution, this dualistic
doctrine vanished from the mortal world, crushed by
papal declarations of heresy. Over the years, the vampires who favored tenets of the philosophy adopted it
as their own.
According to the vampires who follow this Path, the
undead are minions of the evil creator, given eternal
existence to tempt others with the lures of the material
world. Followers of the Path believe that they fulfill a
destiny as creatures tied to the physical world through
vampiric immortality. Because vampires have been
denied the spiritual realms of death, the Albigensians
reason that they must serve the vices of the physical
realm. Therefore, they seek to spread evil and corruption, seeing iniquity as their natural state.
The Albigensians have perfected a code of evils in
which to indulge, however. Theirs is not a Path of
pointless amorality. Taking the beliefs of the original
Cathar priests and twisting them, these vampires deliberately search for means of spreading evil. They pursue
sins of greed, lust, and pride avidly. Cathars seek material wealth and comforts, and they encourage others to
do the same. A vampire can serve his proper purpose
only by embracing the flaws inherent to his form and
to the world, and accepting his duties as a purveyor of
vice. Followers of the Path of Cathari thus ironically
find spirituality in depravity.

The Ethics of the Path
• Indulge in vice. Wealth, sensuality, and material
power are hallmarks of the physical world.
• Lead others to temptation. It is your role to promote the depravity of the world.
• Grant the Curse of Caine to those with great passion. Undeath is an evil curse, but those with great
conviction can use it well.
• The entire material world and its denizens are corrupt. Expect betrayal and wickedness.
• Your role as a creature of evil is predestined. Accept it and fulfill your purpose.
• Death simply leads to reincarnation. Mortals return after you kill them. However, you should avoid Final Death, since you will return as a mortal if you die.

History
The Path of Cathari grew out of the aftermath of the
Albigensian Crusade in the 13th century. The Manicheanist beliefs in dualism influenced some members
of the Church, leading to a 30-year war that many
believe led to the creation of the mortal Inquisition.
After Albigensian vampires resurfaced following the
crusade, they developed this moral system out of the
logical consequences of their philosophy, seeing vampires as tied to the mortal world and therefore purveyors
of evil, while the spirits of humans possessed the only
potential for good. Soon, many vampires took it upon
themselves to fulfill their “duty” as providers of the
mortal world’s corruption. Over the intervening years,
the Path changed to include broader philosophies and
less formal religious overtones. The Path continued to
prove adaptable, keeping the core belief of vampires as
traffickers in the vices of the material world. Quite a
few vampires find purpose in the business of pleasure
— and damnation.

Current Practices
The Albigensians lead others to temptation, despoiling the purity of the spirit. Neonates and elders alike
can be found among the Albigensians. Many practitioners see the fast-paced, decaying modern world as
a sign of success for the forces of the evil creator, and
they seek out ever more challenging converts among
mortals and vampires alike.

Path are not lazy; rather, they undertake their duties
with fanatical abandon. Each Albigensian considers it
his duty to embody the vices of the material world and
to share those comforts and pleasures with others. The
Cathari encourage others to explore their monstrous
natures and to spread hedonism among mortals.

Following the Path
Cathari are usually quite passionate, devoted to vulgarity and pleasure. They see the mortal world as a vast
playground wherein they may satiate their base urges
and encourage others to do likewise. Believing themselves to be agents of immorality, the followers of this
Path are often highly social, befriending and using others to serve their sinful purposes.
Common Abilities: Followers of the Path of Cathari indulge freely in vices and materialism, and they
seek to spread these excesses. Thus, Social Abilities
like Subterfuge and Streetwise are most useful. Some
Albigensians also use Finance and Bureaucracy to earn
money, making their unlives more luxurious. A few of
the more studious followers of the Path indulge in Occult knowledge and Academics in order to study the
roots of the Path.

324

Preferred Disciplines: Albigensians prefer Disciplines
that allow them to fulfill their grim purpose. Dominate
and Presence are most valued for the ability to coerce
mortals into cooperation. They regard the Discipline
of Animalism highly as well, due to its reflection in
Biblical powers, from which the followers of this Path
take some of their beliefs.

The Path of the
Feral Heart
Nickname: Beasts
Virtues: Conviction and Instinct
Bearing: Menace. Those in the presence of a Beast
know that she is a true hunter, just as deer do when
confronting a wolf. The bearing modifier applies to
rolls aimed at terrifying or cowing an opponent.
Basic Beliefs: Vampires are the ultimate hunters —
immortal and invulnerable. The Beast Within is merely the expression of the predator’s instinct. To deny
one’s atavistic impulses is to go against the dictates of
nature, or so this Path’s followers believe. A vampire

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

can only survive by adhering to her inner character
and accepting the monstrous drives that accompany
the unliving state. Though the Beasts do not revel in
their predations, neither do they avoid them. By learning to accept the role of hunter, thereby acknowledging the proper role of the unliving, a vampire becomes
like an animal: feral, predatory, but ultimately in her
proper place.
A follower of this Path feels that the Beast is a natural part of being a vampire and that its needs must be
satiated. Still, the vampire is intelligent, and a cunning
hunter is a more effective one. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between Beast and Man — the
feral cunning and vicious instincts of the vampire are
excellent survival tools, tempered by the reasoning and
insight of the mind. By satiating the Beast’s urges from
time to time, the vampire ironically gains a greater degree of personal control.
Vampires on the Path of the Feral Heart (sometimes
called the Path of the Beast) have little use for the
trappings of civilization or education. Modern transportation and weaponry is unnecessary, for the unliving form provides the necessary tools to stalk and kill.
Subterfuge and politics are trivial concerns; politicking does not bring blood to one’s throat. Vampires are
made to hunt and kill, and the followers of this Path
excel at both.

The Ethics of the Path
• Survival is your first concern.
• Politics or technology simply get in the way of the
hunt.
• Learn to strike a balance with your Beast. Engage
in the brutal actions necessary to survive, but retain
your intelligence and cunning.
• The “natural world” is an illusion. All things must
live according to their forms, and even civilization is
natural because it is the form of humanity.
• Although fire can kill you, you must master your
fear so that you can kill those who would use it against
you.
• Whether running alone or with a pack, your loyalties must be absolute. You have no time for shifting
allegiances.

History
The Path of the Feral Heart seems to have grown
out of ancient codes by which vampiric berserkers accepted their animalistic nature. Espoused originally by

the Gangrel, the Path spread to a few other vampires
who learned to elevate their predatory ways. This Path
was never a popular one, but its constituency remained
constant throughout the ages. The Path has changed
relatively little over the years. Beasts see no real need
to “adapt” the Path to a more modern age.

Current Practices
Beasts have no real organization, and they rarely
engage in any sort of concerted rituals or traditions.
Some few nomads, though, exist as wandering hunters.
When Beasts meet, they often indulge in the Gangrel
practice of sharing stories or indulging in a little practice combat. Beasts also serve as frighteningly effective
assassins; their loyalty, once given, is unquestionable.
Beasts who feel that a particular individual is a threat
to themselves or their pack are relentless in hunting
and destroying the opposition.

Description of Followers
Most Beasts care little for fashion or attire, instead
choosing functional clothing that serves well while
hunting. Some Beasts even disdain ornamentation and
clothing completely, though these are rare. Followers of
this Path often have a great attunement to their senses,
and such individuals are often noted carefully listening
to and watching their surroundings at all times, or even
staying in constant slow motion and sniffing at the air
so as to avoid hidden adversaries. Many Gangrel follow
this Path, and they invariably have animalistic features
that they do not bother to conceal.

Following the Path
Beasts must always recognize and indulge in their
predatory natures. Followers of this Path therefore
strive to develop their prowess as hunters. A Beast has
little desire to use the trappings of technology, believing that the vampiric form provides him with all of the
powers necessary to survive. Indulgence in politics is
frowned upon, as there are more important matters to
handle; force is a simpler and often more effective tool.
Mercy and compassion have no place in the predator’s
heart, and enemies must be harshly destroyed while allies and packmates are protected, as they in turn protect the individual. Beasts do not kill whimsically, but
when killing is necessary, there must be no hesitation.
Common Abilities: Not surprisingly, most Beasts are
highly skilled trackers and hunters. Survival is paramount among these vampires, as well as Brawl and
Athletics. Animal Ken is common, though a Beast

is just as likely to feed upon an animal as to emulate
it. Because they are in touch with their inner natures,
many followers of this Path develop a great deal of
Empathy — not that they feel any pity for their prey,
but rather they intuitively understand the motives of
their victims. Intimidation is also fairly common, for
the simmering fury just below the surface of the Beast’s
outward calm is truly terrifying.
Preferred Disciplines: Disciplines are a matter of
survival for followers of this Path. Animalism is useful
in learning from lesser predators and for feeding. Fortitude is valued, as Beasts must be rugged enough to survive any conditions. The natural weapons and hunting
benefits of Protean are likewise considered valuable,
and some Beasts learn Obfuscate or Celerity to become
faster and cagier hunters.

The Path of
Honorable Accord
Nickname: Knights
Virtues: Conscience and Self-Control

ing modifier affects rolls to resist attempts to manipulate or force them to go against their given purpose.
Basic Beliefs: In a world rife with corruption, malevolence, and insanity, some vampires find direction
through a firm and unyielding code of personal conduct. These vampires do not delve into philosophical
questions of existence or wanton indulgence of their
monstrous sides. Instead, they focus upon one singu-

The Path of Harmony
In past nights, the Path of the Feral Heart was
known as the Path of Harmony, espousing a
strong connection to nature and to the predatory characteristics of individual vampires.
Although a Harmonist feels no remorse for
doing what he must do by nature (hunting,
feeding, and killing) he tempers these actions
with an understanding of his place in the
natural world. As a result, Harmonists espouse
the virtues of Conscience, rather than
Conviction.

Bearing: Devotion. The Knights keep their word,
and are very difficult to sway from their duty. The bear-

326

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

lar principle: honor. Order, fairness, and duty are the
watchwords of these undead, and though still monstrous, they abide by standards of conduct that are rigidly understandable.
To a follower of this Path, unlife must be given direction and purpose. These vampires choose honor as their
guiding hand. By focusing on firm rules and personal
boundaries, the Knights keep the rage of the Beast at
bay. Accepting a duty and fulfilling its obligations provides the Knights with goals to achieve. Bound by their
codes of honor, these vampires uphold causes with the
utmost devotion, even to the ends of their unlives.
Make no mistake; the vampires who follow this Path
are not compassionate or humane in any sense. Indeed,
they see humans as little more than chattel or food,
and undeserving of the considerations of honor that
are bestowed upon other vampires. Even so, a Knight
will never willingly break his given word or renege
on an agreement, as doing so would be a disgrace to
personal honor. The subject of commitment matters
little to a follower of this Path. It is the strength of the
commitment and the unyielding determination that is
important.
Many of the beliefs of the followers of this Path mirror the feudal codes of chivalry or the bushido of the
samurai. Knights gladly suffer Final Death before showing cowardice or betraying their allies. Similarly, this
Path‘s soldiers uphold the policies of their Sects and
organizations with fanatical zeal. Pitted against an unyielding or recalcitrant foe, a solitary Knight is a fatalistic and deadly warrior.

The Ethics of the Path
• Always keep your word and honor your agreements.
• Never show cowardice. Overcome your fears.
• Duty comes before personal matters.
• Treat your equals and betters fairly and equitably.
The dishonorable are beneath your contempt.
• Always repay your debts.
• Support your comrades-at-arms in all things, except where they counsel treachery.

History
The Path of Honorable Accord grew out of bygone
nights, as vampires of the Dark Ages grappled with the
problems of human morality by finding a harsh and unyielding code of conduct to replace the ethics of mankind. Sabbat followers of the Path turned their loyalty

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

327

to the idealism of the Sect and the letter of the Code
of Milan, in the process acquiring the moniker “followers of the Code.” There are also some Camarilla Archons and Alastors who follow the Path, loyal agents
reserved for the most dangerous or difficult missions. A
rare few Camarilla elders, primarily Ventrue, hold on
to the precepts of this Path from their nights of vampiric, medieval chivalry.
Bound by loyalty to the ideals of their Sects, combined with a strong sense of duty and honor, the Knights
fought to uphold the unity of both the Camarilla and
the Sabbat over the centuries. Now, the Path of Honorable Accord forms the backbone of the Sabbat. The
dedicated Knights are the core of the Sect, serving the
ideals of the Sabbat with inhuman devotion.

Current Practices
Followers of the Path of Honorable Accord have always placed a high value on ritual and ceremony. As a
whole, the followers of the Path seek to knit together
disparate factions under the common banner of loyalty
to a cause. Although alternately ignored or derided by
followers of other Paths, the Knights are a stern example of the best qualities of any vampire, and they
cannot be faulted by their brethren. Knights do not often take leadership positions (as they find the political
duplicity appalling), though they are at the forefront

of many battles, showing courage and discipline unmatched by any other soldiers among the undead.

Description of Followers
Knights are by turns cold and aloof, yet honorable
and trustworthy. A Knight never goes back on his word
and always honors his agreements. He does not shirk
his duty or flee from battle. Still, he is far from humane:
The Knight sees humans as a resource, just as another
warrior might see a fine warhorse as admirable but far
from an equitable associate. Many of this Path’s followers display a grim and taciturn image, but the Knights
are capable of humor and joviality — they simply find
that duty outweighs personal gratification.

Following the Path
A follower of the Path of Honorable Accord must always keep honor foremost in his mind. A Knight cannot act rashly or in haste; he must always be aware of
the nature and consequences of his actions. The devout
student of this Path must hold onto courage and discipline at all times while he seeks to dispense justice and
fairness. The true Knight fights and dies for his cause.
Common Abilities: Knights study Melee, Brawl, and
Athletics. Leadership and Expression are valued assets,
as the Knight is often called upon to mediate disputes

Preferred Disciplines: Fortitude and Presence are
considered the epitome of the Knightly way; these
vampires are stalwart in defense and eloquent in discourse. Since so many Knights follow a martial destiny
in the turbulent modern nights, Potence is fairly common as well. The Salubri antitribu of the Sabbat also
develop the puissant abilities of Valeren.

The Path of Lilith
Nickname: Bahari, Lilins
Virtues: Conviction and Instincts
Bearing: Tribulation. The Bahari see enlightenment
through pain and conflict, and they learn to turn pain
to their advantage. The bearing modifier affects rolls
impacted by their own wound penalties.
Basic Beliefs: Considered heretical by most Cainites
of the Sabbat, the fragments of Lilith’s teachings —
sometimes erroneously referred to as the Lilith Cycle
— showcase an elaborate history and an alternate tale
of Creation itself. Cast out from the first garden for the
crimes of elevating herself with the Fruits of Knowledge
and Life, and for seeking to be equal to both man and
God, Lilith wandered the unformed and barren world,
becoming a power of creation equaling the deities of
old. Through tribulation and pain she discovered the
ways of survival; by fire and thorn she created her own
garden, a mirror of the suffering and enlightenment
that she endured. The architect of Caine’s power, the
creator of magick, and the mother to gods, Lilith watered the seeds of wisdom with her own blood, which
empowered anyone to walk through the fire and swim
through the frost to come to the revelation of ultimate
freedom and self-empowerment.
Claiming followers among vampires and other denizens of the hidden world, the Bahari practice the ancient ways handed down by Lilith. By following the
image of the mother-goddess, they raise themselves
from the status of children. Like a parent disciplining an errant child, Lilith passes on a legacy of pain
that teaches, and so the Bahari seek to overcome the
weaknesses of their blind, helpless births, ascending to
understanding and power. By walking in fire, impaling
themselves on thorns and blades, suffering deprivation,
and plunging into icy water, the Bahari excite their
bodies and minds to true sensation, and open their
consciousness to the entirety of the world. From the

dizzying heights of comprehension, at the needlepoint
of pain, they learn the true measure of creation, that
they may take the formless stuff of the world and cast
it in a new image.
Make no mistake, the Bahari have little room for
compassion or conscience. They fully believe that one
must grasp the blade of enlightenment — and suffer its
lacerations — before rising to the truth. Those who do
not have the will or the insight to learn through suffering are chaff, cast aside sadly but unhesitatingly. No
time or resource is wasted on those who do not have
the overpowering need to suffer, change, and grow.
The Hierophants, the vampire-priests of Lilith, choose
those who have heard Lilith’s song and punish, flagellate, and excoriate them until they arrive on the cusp
of seething awareness. Only then are the tears brushed
away with lover’s care, the wounds comforted, and the
supplicants brought into the fullness of Lilith’s glorious
Path.

The Ethics of the Path
• Only through pain are we elevated.
• Be teacher, torturer, and lover to any who seek
enlightenment.
• Practice what you learn. Wisdom is meaningless
unless it accompanies action.
• Cultivate a garden, that you may show the power
of your own creation.
• Seek out those on the border of awareness and initiate them.
• Gather with your brothers and sisters to share your
learning and anguish.

History
According to apocryphal tales, the cult of Lilith
started when a vampire Methuselah, searching for ancient artifacts in Africa some millennia ago, discovered
strange writings purported to tell of the Dark Mother.
Although this Cainite could not acquire the artifacts,
he carried with him the knowledge of what he had
seen. Soundly defeated by the mortal and demonic
guardians of the writings, he retreated to gather others
to him with the knowledge and insight to delve into
the mysteries pieced together from the fragments. Over
the years, followers of the Path of Lilith slowly spread
their archaic knowledge, drawing in small numbers
of erudite and mystically curious vampires. The Path
eventually took on aspects of religion as it absorbed the
rituals and ceremonies of its followers’ native lands.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

329

The Path of Lilith never had very much of a following in the Sabbat, where the antithetical Path of Caine
took sway, but enough followers existed to ensure that
the Path survived. Indeed, even some elders of the Camarilla came to follow the Path. As rumors of Gehenna
grow, more vampires are drawn to the apocryphal teachings of this Path. The visions of Caine as a blundering
fool, cursed with incredible power that he refuses to understand, draw together vampires who seek an alternate
means to survive the End Times. Through the auspices of
the Dark Mother, they hope to rise above their Cainite
nature and become untouchable to the Antediluvians.

Current Practices
Modem Bahari inherit many of the traditions of their
ancient forebears. The followers of this Path rarely
discard rituals or beliefs, for only true understanding
of all of the world’s mysteries can unlock the door to
enlightenment. As such, the Bahari employ many and
varied rites of worship. They often cultivate the hidden knowledge of alien cultures, and they are quick to
absorb and adapt new and different occult practices.
Because of this openness, Bahari engage in a loose network of vampires who trade lore and mystical knowl-

edge, even dealing with wizards, ghosts, and other
keepers of ancient secrets. Bahari often practice rituals
that are bizarre even by the standards of the Sabbat,
and though they are loyal as long as they may continue
to practice their rites, the final loyalty of all Bahari is
ultimately to themselves.

Description of Followers
Bahari live fast-paced, hectic unlives, constantly
striving for the next change and the next learning experience. Anything that shocks or outrages the sensibilities of others is fair game, since there is always the
hope of pushing someone beyond the boundaries of
the banal. Bahari cherish the development of personal
understanding, so followers of this Path can be found
equally among the squalid and the wealthy. When moving among mortals, Bahari are flamboyant and mysterious. In their ceremonies, they often wear flowing, open
cloaks and ceremonial masks of wood or bone.
Contrary to some beliefs, this Path is not exclusively
followed by women, although they do make up a majority of its practitioners. Anyone who throws away the
caul of childish ignorance for painful maturity is welcome in the circle of Lilith.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

Following the Path
A Lilin breaks with convention, flouting “accepted
society” in order to force others to re-evaluate their
views of the world. With the branding-iron and the
scourge, the Cainite brings painful lessons that, if survived, make the postulant stronger. Those who hover
on the edge of awareness are watched carefully for
the final soul-wrenching revelation that brings them
strength. To visit pain and even death is the greatest
gift that can be given, for through these trials the individual comes to understand herself. Each must discover her own inward seeds of Knowledge and Life, so
as to become a universe unto herself and an architect
of creation. The garden, the symbol of life shaped and
cultivated with care, is the manifestation of the Bahari’s devotion to expressing what she has created and
learned.

morphosist Fiends speak, however, reveals the true
monstrosity of their philosophy. They believe that the
next step is a state akin to apotheosis, and they will do
anything — anything — to achieve it.
The Tzimisce are characteristically thorough in their
study of this Path’s ideals. By coordinating their experiments on living, dead, and undead subjects (as well as
other curiosities they may come across, like werewolves
or the errant faerie), the Fiends have formed complex
theories as to precisely what the next step in vampiric
transcendence is. The solitary and suspicious Tzimisce
rarely compare notes, however, and the Path’s development suffers as each follower spends much of her
unlife learning the rudiments that other Kindred have
already deciphered.

The Ethics of the Path
• Learn the characteristics of all stages of life and
death.

Common Abilities: Medicine, an understanding of
the body in order to dispense pain without killing, is
first and foremost among a Lilin’s skills. As mystics of
the ancient secrets, Occult is crucial. Academics and
Science are also valuable tools in the search for truth.

• One should not concern oneself overly with mortals — they are a step below the Kindred, not above
them.

Preferred Disciplines: Lilith is said to have invoked
various powers in herself as she walked the unformed
earth, powers that aided in her survival. Bahari often
emulate these powers, focusing upon the Disciplines of
Animalism, Celerity, Fortitude, and Obfuscate.

• Indulge the Beast and deny it; true comprehension
of unlife requires a broad range of experience.

The Path of
Metamorphosis

• Do not share knowledge with others, as it is too
valuable to trust to flawed creatures.

• One should alter and augment one’s body —
changing the flesh may pave the way toward changing
the soul.
• Do not heed the needs or desires of others, as their
lack of introspection may distract even the keenest intellect.

Nickname: Metamorphosists

History

Virtues: Conviction and Instinct

The Tzimisce have researched this Path in their solitary way for literally thousands of years. They have always been creatures of tremendous mystical potential;
the followers of this Path seek to realize that potential.
Followers of this Path relate very little to the world
outside themselves, and many relate this fact to the inexorable decline of the Clan itself.

Bearing: Inhumanity. Metamorphosists work steadily to become something other than human. Bearing
modifiers apply to Intimidation, as well as any Manipulation rolls that can be positively affected by frightening the target.
Basic Beliefs: The world is made up of evolutionary
chains. Animals are below humans, who are below the
Kindred. The metaphysical, arcane members of Clan
Tzimisce follow this Path, which focuses on defining
and attaining the state of being beyond the curse of
vampirism. Citing their transformative use of Vicissitude, the Tzimisce believe they have the potential to
transcend the constraints of the flesh. Hearing Meta-

Current Practices
Most Metamorphosists claim membership in the
Sabbat but pay it little more than lip service, involved
as they are in more esoteric pursuits. In truth, this Path
predates any Sect, and Kindred committing themselves
to it subscribe to beliefs and creeds far older than petty
notions of Kindred politics.

and theology in hopes of uncovering secrets unexplored
in larger fields of study.

Followers of the Path of Metamorphosis are truly
some of the most alien creatures any Kindred could
meet. Metamorphosists are cold, utterly inhuman, and
exactingly scientific. Their concerns are metaphysical rather than ethical, and it is precisely this frame
of mind that leads many to believe that the Metamorphosists have literally begun their transformation into
something else. Some take this a step further by altering
their flesh in various means until they no longer have a
recognizable gender or look even remotely human.

Following the Path
Metamorphosists conduct all manner of bizarre experiments, most of which take place far from others’
eyes. It is a distant, lonely philosophy, removed from
any needs other than the matter of sustenance. Followers should be heedless of others around them, existing
only to satisfy their personal concerns.
Common Abilities: This Path concerns itself almost
exclusively with Knowledges, particularly those of Occult, Medicine, and Science. Many Metamorphosists

The Path of Night borrows heavily from Catholic
dogma, though it concerns itself more with abandonment and damnation than redemption. The vampire’s
purpose in unlife, according to this Path, is to scourge
the Earth, to act as an agent of evil and, thus, ultimately to do the bidding of the greater powers that dictate
good and evil alike. No one lives without original sin,
and those who follow this Path are beholden to expose
and exacerbate that sin. Life and unlife are varying
states of damnation; those who fail to realize their full
potential are lost sheep, suitable only for slaughter.
This is one of the most terrible Paths in existence,
as it concerns itself with the outright and intentional
persecution of others. Its followers are more than mere
bullies or sadists, however. One who receives the curse
of Caine is bound by fate and duty to wreak vengeance
upon the Children of Seth. In so doing, vampires on
this Path hope that, by fulfilling the roles meant for
them, they can transcend those roles and find ultimate
peace. This final goal aside, though, the Path of Night
is a Path of hostility and antagonism, and the company
of those who follow it is extremely hard to abide.

The Ethics of the Path
• Leave no being untouched by your taint.
• Tempt and horrify those around you; the weak will
fall, while the strong will be tempered by your testing
of them.
• Inspire others to accept their inner darkness.
• Experience every sensation imaginable, and then
some.
• Death is a means, not an end.
• Kindred, as souls damned by God, fulfill their purpose by preying upon mortals.

History
Few, if any, have certifiably chronicled this Path’s
inception or evolution. By varying accounts the outgrowth of medieval death cults, Satanic cabals, debased Methuselahs, or the practices upheld by Adam’s
first wife Lilith and her children, the Path of Night
has been forsaken by most Kindred with any sense of
Humanity at all. Some suspect a coterie of Lasombra
known as the Black Angels foment dissension among
the Clan, turning impressionable Keeper neonates
down the Path’s unwholesome trail.

Current Practices
No sin is too vile for a follower of this Path to indulge, and no trust is too sacred to break. Kindred on
the Path of Night tie their fates very closely to mortals,
who bear the brunt of their depredations. As harbingers of damnation, the Nihilists cull the secret fears
and sorrows of humans around them, inflicting these
terrors upon the kine as the whim takes them.
Ironically, vampires on this Path often have great reverence for those whom they perceive as truly “good” or
“blessed.” Indeed, one infamous Keeper, who plagued
a family of witch-hunters down three generations and
was finally destroyed by a scion of the line, is rumored
to have praised his destroyer for her resolve.

Description of Followers
This Path is upheld almost exclusively by Lasombra,
though the Keepers find occasional converts among
other Clans. Lasombra who follow this Path are held
in low regard by many other Keepers, as there is no
room for nobility on this Path. While most Lasombra
maintain other codes of morality drawn from the Sabbat, the ones who follow this Path are true fiends.

Following the Path
Vampires on the Path of Night terrorize their victims, a term which may apply to anyone to whom the
Nihilist is drawn. Kindred on this Path are loath to
kill — that removes potential targets, though they are
not above doing so if the death may cause great grief
to others or if preventing it would inconvenience their
own existence. To some degree, the Nihilists shepherd
the kine, showing them what may await them if they
are unrepentant. However, no follower of this Path
would openly admit such a thing. In their own minds,
they are devils, pure and simple.
Common Abilities: Kindred on this Path specialize
in Abilities that allow them to torment others. Brawl,
Intimidation, Melee, and Medicine (for physiological
knowledge) all have their value.
Preferred Disciplines: Followers of this Path cultivate Obtenebration for the sheer terror it inspires, as
well as Potence for the pain it allows one to inflict.

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

The Path of Paradox
Nickname: Shilmulo (a Romani word for vampire)
Virtues: Conviction and Self-Control
Bearing: Confidence. The Shilmulo believe that
they are in the exact place and time they are meant to
be, doing what they are meant to do — and it shows.
The bearing modifier applies to attempts to manipulate
or lead others.
Basic Beliefs: Inspired by Hinduism and upheld predominantly by vampires of the Ravnos Clan, the Path of
Paradox concerns itself with the vampires’ karmic duty
to continue the grand cycle of ages. According to the
Path of Paradox, Kindred are locked perpetually outside the illusory cycle of the universe (maya). Whereas
most beings are reincarnated through samsara, a continual “entanglement” in the cycle of rebirth, Kindred
have eluded that cycle. Every individual has his own
purpose, or svadharma, according to the Path of Paradox, although vampires, excluded from the cycle, have
lost theirs. In place of the dharma they once followed,
each Kindred must now try to advance maya, hopefully
understanding it in the process and finally penetrating the great illusions that shroud Ultimate Truth from
their eyes.
The means by which the Ravnos undertake this cyclical advancement, however, is by selective deception. Other vampires look upon the Ravnos as untrustworthy, and can hardly be expected to take the
advice of the Deceivers. As such, the Ravnos have
had to resort to elaborate ruses in order to get other
vampires — or, indeed, anyone with whom they come
in contact at all — to undertake a course of action.
Ravnos vampires see their undead state as a curse, like
many other Kindred do. However, the Ravnos believe
this is due to their failure to understand maya. Other
Kindred, also removed from the karmic wheel, often
fail to realize the necessity of their return to the cycle.
Shilmulo understand this — and expedite their return
by destroying them.

The Ethics of the Path
• Embrace only if absolutely necessary, and then
only from the jati (family line).
• Interpret the svadharma of others and aid them in
their fulfillment of it.
• Destroy other Kindred, for they are unnatural to
maya.

• Erase karmic debt, dispel maya’s illusions and return to the samsara.
• Use deception to achieve your ends, as others bear
the fault of distrust.
• Confuse the Antediluvians by returning their
childer to the cycle.

History
This Path arose among the Ravnos during the latter
nights of the Roman Empire. The deceit the Ravnos
command is even believed by some to have played a
major role in the collapse of the empire. The Path, according to many Ravnos, had become debased shortly
after Rome’s collapse and had remained so for hundreds
of years until a stirring (and secret) event contrived to
encourage the Ravnos to rethink their ways.

Current Practices
It is too simple a conceit to say that the Ravnos destroy vampires and burn karma. In fact, the Path of
Paradox is arduous and demanding. Many of the Ravnos’ deceptions are, in reality, complicated tests designed to cause the subject to reveal hidden aspects of
herself. Thus, the Ravnos travel the world, ousted by
ignorant Kindred who fail to realize the necessity of
the Shilmulo’s duties.

Description of Followers
Most followers of this Path are Ravnos, though small
numbers of Malkavians and Gangrel adhere to the
Path. Increasingly cosmopolitan Kindred have surfaced among the Ravnos Clan, indicating that either
the Ravnos pay little heed to their code or that jati are
more extended than one might think.

Following the Path
Kindred on the Path of Paradox commonly hold
other vampires in contempt, believing that they ignorantly or arrogantly refuse to seek their reintroduction
to the cycle. As such, the Ravnos have taken the responsibility upon their shoulders to do it for them. This
may require concocting complex webs of deception in
order to ascertain what a given person’s svadharma is,
or simply destroying a vampire and placing her back in
the cycle, where a new svadharma awaits.
Common Abilities: Kindred on this Path focus on
Abilities that allow them to gain advantage over others, such as Alertness, Empathy, Subterfuge, Stealth,
and Investigation.

which they may better divine hidden secrets.

The Path of Power
and the Inner Voice
Nickname: Unifiers
Virtues: Conviction and Instinct
Bearing: Command. Unifiers are destined for power,
and they know it. Those around them can feel their
commanding presence. Their bearing modifier affects
rolls to command or lead others.
Basic Beliefs: When given eternal life, incredible
power, and inhuman thirsts, the only true existence is
as an undying overlord. There is no use in pining for
lost humanity or in secreting oneself away to study arcane lore; vampires are without honor or compassion.
The role of a vampire is the role of a master.

336

The followers of this Path see the exercise of power
and control as the best reason for vampiric existence.
Control of the self and of the external world is the only
goal worth pursuing. To this end, a vampire must develop her abilities, extend her influence and play her
pawns. By bending the world to her will, the vampire
creates order and stability. Every form of power, influence, or control can be used to further some end.
Therefore, Unifiers seek all forms of power, whether
political, material, or spiritual.
Unifiers follow their own insight when exercising their
authority. Although this Path is highly concerned with
temporal power, it is also quite spiritual; Unifiers are
avid pursuers of wisdom and enlightenment. Of course,
all such knowledge ultimately turns to the pursuit of
personal power. By understanding oneself, it is possible
to begin to describe the motivations of others. True understanding, therefore, allows the vampire to unlock the
secrets of enemies and allies alike, to carefully dissect
any situation and discern the most proper course of action. From such judgments, the vampire decides upon
the most favorable means of taking or keeping control.
The followers of this Path are rightly feared and respected. No adherent to this Path tolerates weakness

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

or failure; punishment is swift and often fatal. Indeed,
punishment serves not only to remonstrate the offender, but as an example to others. Thus, Unifiers have no
mercy or compassion. Sabbat packs with Unifier Ducti
are Darwinian in the extreme.
Unifiers are consummate politicians and strategists.
Although blood bonds and emotional ties can motivate followers, the pragmatic students of this philosophy recognize that such measures can be fought and
compromised. Thus, vampires of this Path believe that
control should only be woven through methods that
cannot be subverted: Pain, rage, desire, and depravity
are key among their tools. A recruit who serves out of
loyalty can be bought; a follower who serves out of duty
can be blackmailed; an adherent who serves out of love
can be disillusioned. Therefore, fear and respect for
power, anger, and hate directed towards one’s enemies,
the fulfillment of lust and the lessons of pain make the
most persuasive directives.

The Ethics of the Path
• Do not tolerate failure — including your own.
Punish it visibly and harshly.
• Be sporadic in your rewards. Drive your followers
to excel, but never let them assume that reward follows
excellence.
• Strive for control by any means. Dominate the
world around you and bend it to your will.
• Use the most effective tool for any undertaking.
Hate, fear, and anger are key among these tools, but
feign benevolence.
• Show respect to those in authority, but replace
them when they falter.
• Deal from a position of power. Do not show weakness.

History
The Path of Power and the Inner Voice supposedly
started with a Lasombra by the name of Lord Marcus,
in the early 16th century. The Path‘s constant push
to develop power and influence led to many followers
who devoutly supported the Sabbat in its early nights,
and as such, many of the Path‘s adherents assumed positions of authority during the formation of the Sabbat. Even tonight, the Path is well-respected within
the Sabbat, and some of its precepts have even started
to gain grudging acceptance among the power-hungry
and jaded elders of the Camarilla.

Modern nights have seen an explosion of membership in this Path. Though always popular, the Path
has attracted many new followers from the expanding ranks of the Sabbat. The sheer ruthlessness and
shrewdness of many of these recruits is responsible for
the slow evolution of the Path from a respectable but
dictatorial philosophy into a Path of iron-fisted, Machiavellian social tyranny.

Current Practices
Followers of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice
do not have an organized association, but they do engage in many similar practices. All Unifiers participate
in War Parties and blood hunts, often assuming roles
of leadership. Various displays of willpower are a means
to demonstrate power and self-mastery, so Unifiers participate in many such rituals or opportunities as well.

Description of Followers
Unifiers are driven, confident, and even megalomaniacal. The need for control combined with introspection makes followers of this Path into corrupt and
brutish tyrants. Some followers of the Path espouse
dictatorship, but the truly enlightened use martial philosophy and an understanding of psychology to incite
their followers. The typical Unifier accepts no excuses,
drives himself and his subjects mercilessly, and shows
no pity or compassion for failure.

Following the Path
A Unifier accepts no defeat. The appearance of benevolence is useful, but all failure must be punished
eventually. The follower of the Path must always strive
to control the situations around him and heed his own
judgment. Respect should be given to those in positions of authority, but those who falter must be cast
down and replaced. Followers of this Path seek wealth,
influence, and support. Rule should be achieved by any
means necessary — when alliances or honor are useful,
they are used, but otherwise, fear and hate are more
appropriate. The Unifier constantly seeks out means
of developing his own capabilities and furthering his
own agenda.
Common Abilities: Leadership, Intimidation, Politics, Subterfuge, and similar Abilities are highly appropriate to followers of this Path. Unifiers often make a
study of some sort of combat prowess, be it Brawl or
Melee, in order to back up their authority. Empathy
can also highlight the way to inner awareness.

natural Disciplines to their fullest potential.

The Path of Typhon
Nickname: Theophidians (only among themselves;
the outside world knows them as Corrupters or by the
Followers of Set nickname, Serpents)
Virtues: Conviction and Self-Control
Bearing: Devotion. The Theophidians do everything with an eye to how they might best serve Set.
The bearing modifier aids in attempts to win converts
and in rolls to resist powers based on other faiths (such
as True Faith – see p. 372).
Basic Beliefs: Vampires who follow the Path of Typhon have a truly sinister purpose in mind. Theophidians seek the resurrection of their patron and father,
Set. Though most vampires view Set simply as a mythi-

338

Failure is instructive only when used as a negative
example.

cal member of the Third Generation, Theophidian
doctrine teaches that Set was, in fact, a divine being
even before his Embrace. Indeed, Theophidians view
Caine as a lesser being than Set, and claim that Set in
fact allowed Caine to Embrace him so that he might
use the descendants of Caine to strike at his divine
counterparts, such as the mythical Gaia and Lilith. In
this manner Set and the Setites fulfill their place in
the universe, acting as agents of entropy and breaking
down the old so that the new may blossom.
Accordingly, this Path preaches the importance of
influence and control. Many Setites on the surface appear to be little more than pimps, pushers, and fixers;
in truth, they are much more. Setites commonly view
other individuals as tools or resources to be used. By
gaining control over others, the Setites may exploit
them to fulfill their own ends. Thus, rather than owing
those who provide them with information or services,
the Setites reverse the role, and instead have their
marks come to them first.
Followers of this Path revere Set as something more
than a vampire — Set is attributed a deified status, almost a literal translation of the Egyptian god of the

CHAPTER SEVEN: MORALITY

Underworld. Ways to achieve this reincarnation differ,
and for this reason, the Followers of Set extend their
influence in hopes of finding information wherever it
resides.

The Ethics of the Path
• Gather information, secret or otherwise, and learn
how it applies to the resurrection of Set.
• Contribute to the Clan’s greater goal of reviving its
slumbering master.
• Bring others under your sway, increasing your influence and capability.
• Subjugate the Beast, as its reckless wiles serve only
itself.
• Maintain a veil of secrecy, for others look poorly
upon this Path’s methods.
• Look for Set’s hidden signs and act upon them.

History
Theophidians claim a history dating back to nights
before the First City. Whether or not this is true is
a matter of much debate, especially among detractors. Nevertheless, the widespread presence of human
myths that mimic the relationship between Set and

Osiris lends credence to its longevity. For millennia,
the Theophidians have plied their degenerate trade
from back alleys to holy temples and everywhere in
between. Many leaders among the Kindred and kine
alike owe their acquisition of power to the followers of
this Path, though the prices they have paid are high.

Current Practices
Theophidians support no Sect other than their own
Clan, though some Setites have forsaken the resurrection of Set and actually oppose his quest from the
ranks of the Sabbat. Many followers of this Path cultivate blood cults of devout followers and indenture
legions of desperate individuals to themselves. While
the Theophidians are not averse to doing “dirty work”
themselves — quite the contrary — they reason that,
with others serving their purposes, they can accomplish much more. Thus, followers of this Path play
many roles: seekers, fixers, scholars, courtesans, and
harvesters of souls.

Description of Followers
The Theophidians are frequently social chameleons,
given their need to move through many different circles. They are smooth, ingratiating, and wholly inspired
by their greater cause. Followers of this Path rarely ask

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

339

favors of others; they prefer to help satisfy the desires of
others and then call in favors. It is this side that nonSetite Kindred see most frequently and despise; they
publicly decry the vice-peddling and corruption of the
Followers of Set as breaches of the Masquerade or the
puppetry of the Ancients. The Setites know the truth,
however: Other Kindred are loath to acknowledge the
desires that a canny Theophidian can satisfy. Clever
Setites have even managed to convince non-Setite
Kindred to follow this Path after long periods of corruption, dependency, and debasement.

Following the Path
Followers of the Path of Typhon are first and foremost seekers of arcane lore, though their keen social
graces also make them silver-tongued diplomats. These

Kindred are also insidious, working their way into existing vampire societies with serpentine façades of false
identities and cadres of loyal followers. The eldest
Theophidian in a given locale often erects a temple
to Set in some out-of-the-way place to better serve the
slumbering god.
Common Abilities: Any Ability that helps the Kindred
achieve her end is prized by the followers of this Path. As
such, the Theophidians have very diverse and capable
members. Abilities of particular favor among the Setites
include Empathy, Intimidation, Streetwise, Subterfuge,
Performance, Academics, Investigation, and Politics.
Preferred Disciplines: Theophidians are masters of
the reptilian Discipline of Serpentis, though their dealings with others inspire them to pursue the Setite Clan
Disciplines of Presence and Obfuscate.

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

Chapter Eight:
Storytelling
"I gave a cry of anguish at this terrible curse and tore at my flesh. I wept
blood. I caught the tears in a cup and drank them."
- The Book of Nod

Tell me a story.
Forget about the pages of rules and the handfuls of
dice. Close the book, turn out the lights, and tell me a
story about dark desires and relentless hunger. I’ll tell
you about a vampire, about her talents and her weaknesses, and you tell me what kind of challenges she
faces, what rewards or perils come her way. You plan
the twists and turns the story will take, and I will tell
you how the vampire navigates them. Neither of us
will quite know how the story ultimately ends, or how
the vampire will arrive there.
That is the challenge of storytelling. Vampire is
about the inner struggle between humanity and monstrosity in the face of unfettered power and eternal life.
No mortal law binds the Kindred, and no moral code
restrains them. Only fading passions or ideals nurtured
in mortal life keep a vampire from indulging her horrific
nature, and those memories become harder and harder
to recall as the years stretch into centuries. In short,
Vampire is about the characters and how they develop
— or wither — in the face of tragedy and temptation.
Can a mortal steeped in religious faith reconcile her
deeply-held beliefs with her lust for blood? Can a vampire resist the temptation to Embrace her lover rather
than face an eternity of loneliness? The Beast awaits

any Kindred who surrenders herself completely to her
predatory urges. The Storyteller draws on the characters’ backgrounds, hopes, and ambitions to create stories that challenge their — and their players’ — convictions and beliefs. As a result, taking on the role of a
Storyteller in a Vampire game is demanding, requiring
careful thought and background work to build character-driven chronicles and stories. You must create a
world that is a nightmare reflection of our own, erotic
and grotesque, exhilarating and horrifying. You must
evoke the thrill of inhuman power and a fear of what
might happen if the character ever loses control. And
you can’t let the characters just keep to themselves and
survive off daring thefts from the local blood bank. The
night air is thick with the intrigues of the elders, and
the ancillae manipulate neonates as they see fit, promising great rewards — and even greater risks.
Storytelling sounds like a lot to manage all at once,
and it is at first. Fortunately, the Storyteller doesn’t
have to do it all herself. The secret to successful storytelling is actually the work of the players. Fulfilling
the expectations and interests of a chronicle’s players is
the first trick to creating the game’s setting. Then — if
the chronicle and its overall story have been carefully
developed — the actions of the characters, both good

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

345

and bad, will have consequences that in turn spawn
further stories. Never forget: The more the players are
involved with what happens in a chronicle, the less
work you, the Storyteller, must take upon yourself.
You aren’t supposed to do it all alone. The Storyteller
should have as much fun with the game as the players.
This chapter illustrates the process of creating and
running a Vampire chronicle, and offers advice for
making the most out of the individual stories that carry
the chronicle along. Building a detailed and cohesive
background, a world for your players to hunt in, begins
with input from your players and your own ideas for
what kind of an overall story you would like to tell.
Once you have decided on the details of the setting,
the next step is creating characters to fill it, again keeping in mind the kind of overarching story you want to
tell. After the characters are in place, you can then get
to writing the chronicle in earnest, working out the
intrigues and events that move the overall story along
and draw on each character’s goals and motivations.
Finally, we offer some techniques to use when running
the chronicle, advice to keep each evening of gaming
engaging and fresh.

The First, Fleeting
Glimpse
It starts with a couple of ideas. You read through the
book, and some things jump out at you. Maybe it’s the
concept of a haughty Prince ruling a city with an oppressive hand, the image of an Archbishop in robes
preaching to a legion of inhuman monsters, or perhaps
you like the idea of a band of Anarchs making their
own rules and living like wolves in the urban wilderness. Something catches your eye and sets off a spark
in your mind, and you think, “This could make a cool
chronicle.” The question is, how do you turn these
nebulous ideas into a well-rounded foundation for the
stories you want to tell?
The first step begins with the players. Before you can
really develop the foundation for your chronicle, you
must have a strong grasp on what sorts of characters
they want to play and how their concepts relate to
your ideas. Suppose you are considering a chronicle set
against the backdrop of a Prince’s meteoric rise and fall
in a large, important city. You might envision stories
of intrigue, treachery, and the corrupting influence of

346

great power. But what if one player has her heart set
on playing a Nosferatu Anarch, and another wishes
to be a fanatical, inhuman Toreador antitribu, neither
of which is compatible with your overall concept? It’s
never a good idea to force a character concept on a
player, because you want players to feel like they are
contributing to the game and playing characters in
whom they are really interested. At this point comes
some amount of negotiation and compromise; perhaps
you can interest them in your backdrop of political
conflicts and double-dealing, but shift the focus of the
chronicle to center instead on the characters’ struggles
to avoid the plots of their elders while pursuing their
individual agendas. Or perhaps the Toreador might
work better as an infiltrator for the Sabbat while the
Anarch acts as an “ambassador” for his gang to the local court? The important point is to make sure that
your ideas and the players’ expectations are in synch
before you even begin to develop the chronicle. This
way they players can add their ideas to your own and
make your job much easier in the long run.
Once everyone agrees on the general idea of the
chronicle, the players can begin to create their characters and you can begin to create the world in which
they will hunt. It’s worthwhile to do this simultaneously, because it allows your ideas and theirs to play
off one another, and might point you in directions
that you could have missed otherwise. Suppose, for example, that a player wants her character to have been
a government agent prior to her Embrace. You could
then take this idea and expand upon it: The character
worked for a covert division within the Department
of Homeland Security, performing counterintelligence
work that specifically investigates high-level corporate
executives and politicians as potential terrorist plants.
This division has in fact been subverted by a powerful
vampire who uses it as a resource to gather influential
information and hinder the activities of her rivals. To
add yet another level of conflict, you might decide that
this Primogen is now eyeing another member of the
division for the Embrace, someone whom the character was close to as a mortal. You can then encourage
the player to further develop the agency her character
worked for, letting her provide details such as a history and important personalities that you blend into
your world. This lets her flesh out her character, allows
her to contribute to the game as a whole, and gives
you valuable resource material for your chronicle. Get
your players to go into a lot of detail when creating

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

their characters. Sit in with them during the creation
process, and brainstorm about their backgrounds, then
make the most of the information they come up with.
They can provide you with a whole host of characters,
situations, and conflicts that will be of use to you later.
(The prelude is a great method for this — see p. 352
for more.)
It is important to take the characters’ Backgrounds
into account and develop them in detail. Encourage
the purchase of Allies, Contacts, and Resources, then
brainstorm with the player to flesh them out. Where
do a character’s Resources come from? Is she an heiress? Did she win the lottery? Did she stumble onto a
drug deal gone sour and steal the bloodstained cash?
What effect do these circumstances have on who the
character is and her place in the chronicle? Likewise,
Allies or Contacts are more than just dots on the character sheet — they are people with their own feelings
and emotions. For instance, suppose a player wants her
character to have a midlevel contact in the police department. Who is this contact, and how did the character establish this relationship? The contact might
be the character’s uncle, a veteran homicide detective
who has a habit of asking pointed questions about the
character’s lifestyle and activities (particularly if he
catches her at the scene of a recent murder!).
Each Background is an added dimension to the character concept, containing a wealth of ideas to inspire
a Storyteller. How do the characters handle the sudden and irrevocable separation from everything they
have ever known or loved? Do they fake their deaths,
or simply walk away from their mortal lives? Do the
characters leave loved ones who will go to any lengths
to find them? Can the characters stay away from spouses or children, torn by love yet knowing what might
happen one night when the Hunger overtakes them?
These situations are some of the first dilemmas that the
characters must face, and can influence their actions in
many subtle ways. While it is always tempting to just
gloss over the particulars of each character’s Embrace
and get on with “being a vampire,” this leaves out a
vital dimension in the character’s struggle to maintain
her humanity, and provides you with a fertile field to
draw ideas and supporting characters.
Once you have determined a general direction for
your chronicle and incorporated elements of the players’ characters, you can make some decisions about the
world in which their stories will take place.

A Dark and
Deadly World
Before your chronicle can be written, there must be
a stage where its actions can be played out. You need
to create a setting for your stories, a world that supports the themes and ideas you want to explore in your
chronicle and starkly illustrates the glories and terrors
of undead existence. The world of the vampire is dark,
dangerous, enigmatic, sensual, and rich in imagery.
Consider these example guidelines when inventing the
details of your world:
• The Extinction of Virtue: There are few illusions
left in the World of Darkness. Centuries of greed and
deceit (on the part of humans as well as Kindred) have
eroded humanity’s innocence. Cynicism and despair
permeate everything. No one dares to believe in much
of anything, because virtues like compassion and charity are just invitations to be victimized. A gentle soul
and a loving heart are rare as diamonds, and as precious.
• Blood and Money: Life is cheap, and desperate
people resort to violence out of frustration, fear, hatred, and greed. Crime is ever-present, and many families and neighborhoods adapt a siege mentality against
the rest of the world. It’s us or them.
• No More Good Guys: The world has lost its heroes. They were caught in sex scandals or taking bribes,
or perhaps they fell victim to endemic urban violence.
There is no strong leadership, no faith in politicians,
and no belief in building a better tomorrow. People
know better.
• Haunted Houses: Humanity is rotting from within,
continuing a sad, slow decline, and symbols of its decay are everywhere in the weathered façades of Gothic
churches and granite office buildings. Amid soulless
towers of steel and glass sits an abandoned cathedral
whose stained glass is rich with color and beauty from
a time now lost. Such a place serves as a haunting reminder of what might have been, or could be again.
These points illustrate the essence of the World of
Darkness, and they are important because they heighten the dilemmas that your characters face as they grapple with their fading humanity. Despair and resignation
are all around them; violence and death are common.
What is one more killing, one more lie? How much

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

347

difference can one person, even a vampire, make? This
struggle is the source of the game’s triumph and tragedy, and the decisions you make in developing your
setting should take this into account. It is important to
point out that you don’t have to adhere religiously to
these concepts, and the degree to which you emphasize them is strictly a matter of personal taste — for
example, a game in which the Paths of Enlightenment
are dominant might focus more on exaltation of this
decay rather than the struggle with it. The only truly
important thing to remember is that your environment
should be one in which doing the right and honorable
thing is difficult and daunting.
There is no limit to the possible physical locations
you can choose for your chronicle — with enough
imagination and forethought, a Vampire chronicle can
be set anywhere from New York City to the Amazon
Basin. The best locations are major cities, because they
allow for a large population of vampires and are focal
points for the money and power that most Kindred
seek. Some Storytellers prefer to set their chronicles in
dark reflections of their own hometowns, which allows
them and their players to draw upon everyday knowledge to help envision the places that their characters
visit. However, if you wish to locate your chronicle in
a large city that you are unfamiliar with, feel free — the
Internet has a wealth of useful information, which you
can then reinterpret to suit your purposes. You aren’t
constrained to be faithful in every detail, though; this
is the World of Darkness, and you can shape it any way
you choose. You can even make a completely fictional
city, one that can be crafted to be exactly what your
chronicle needs.
As you map out the length and breadth of your locale,
draw ideas from important city features, combining
function with symbolism to make interesting images.
For instance, an abandoned and decaying train station
in the center of the city might make an ideal site for
Elysium, with its high, vaulted halls and faded grandeur. A little-used cathedral might become a haven for
the city’s Caitiff, who are drawn to its symbolism of
sanctuary and redemption. A half-built zoo could serve
as the Sabbat’s playground, or a block of skeletal construction sites could give the Nosferatu an aerie to look
out over the streets. Vampires are territorial creatures,
and the places they claim invariably mirror their individual character and attitudes. Again, don’t let hard
reality dissuade you from going with a cool idea; if you
want your Prince to rule from a Victorian mansion but
your city doesn’t have one, make one and put it where

348

you want. In Vampire, details always take a back seat
to mood and imagery.
At this point you have three sources to draw on to
build the setting of your chronicle: You have your own
general ideas, you have all the details provided by your
players during character creation, and you have at least
some knowledge of the locale you have chosen. Now
comes the time to develop your chronicle in detail.

Written in Blood
The chronicle is the overall story that the Storyteller
wishes to tell with his players. It is made up of a series
of smaller stories in which the player characters are the
central figures. What happens in each individual story
depends a lot on the course of the chronicle as a whole.
It’s this stage of development — deciding on the main
thrust of that larger-scale story — that is the most demanding and time-consuming for the Storyteller.
Unlike many other open-ended roleplaying game
“campaigns,” Vampire chronicles often have a definite
beginning, middle, and end. Accordingly, you need
to detail this structure in advance in order to organize
your thoughts, realize when to pick up the pace, and
provide tension over the course of individual stories. A
chronicle loses its focus and energy if there is no real
end in sight; you want to close things off with a bang,
not a whimper. A small journal, online wiki, or word
processing document can help to hold notes and ideas
as you outline the course of events in your chronicle.
Don’t try to keep it all in your head.
At this point, you have a pretty large amount of information to help guide your development of the chronicle. Now you have to flesh out the course the stories
will take and blend all of the details into a workable
whole. The first step is to choose a governing theme,
the central idea that describes the basic plotline of the
overall story. Themes are important because they let
you focus the events and actions of your chronicle, giving it consistency and emotional resonance, which you
can build to a climactic finale. Some suitable themes
for Vampire chronicles were mentioned in Chapter
One (pp. 14-15), but you may have some other ideas
suitable for your own game.
Once you have chosen a theme (or themes!), you
can begin to develop the course of events that your
chronicle will take, from beginning to climax. Like any
good story, a chronicle must have a satisfying climax to
be truly effective, and if you know where the chronicle

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

is going, you will have much more confidence in your
stories. Consider your initial ideas, the characters and
themes you have chosen, and then flesh out the details
of your chronicle as a rough outline of events.
For example, let’s go back to the initial idea of a
group of characters whose Embrace and unlife begin
against the backdrop of a charismatic vampire’s rise
and fall as Prince of a city. You might decide on two
themes for your chronicle: A War of Ages and Conspiracy. You like the idea of giving the characters a vision of the freedom and power that elder Kindred possess, then drawing them into an ever-tightening mesh
of intrigue and deceit as they find themselves in a position to grab power and status by the side of the wouldbe Prince. Once in power, the façade of idealism and
enlightenment falls away, and the new Prince proves
to be every bit the despot that her predecessor was.
The characters, for all their newfound influence, are
trapped in a web of obligations and allegiances to the
Prince and her other allies, no more free to do as they
please than they were as neonates. As events worsen,
rumbles of dissent spread throughout the city, and the
characters must question not only their loyalty to the
current regime, but also the worthiness of the Camarilla’s philosophies as a whole. You want the chronicle
to end in a blazing climax, during which the characters
must decide whether to hold true to their loyalties for
the sake of honor and principle, or to bring down the
Prince they helped raise to power and choose a new
course for the city.
Now you need to determine a rough outline sequence
of events to get the characters to that point. Things
should start out simply, because the characters will
need some time to get acquainted with the city and its
denizens. You decide that the first stories will center on
each character’s Embrace and relationship with their
sires, challenging the characters to reconcile their new
existences with the ties of their mortal lives. How the
characters react to their new situation can spawn conflicts and goals that you can expand as subplots over the
course of the chronicle. Along the way, the characters
come into contact with some of the other Kindred in
the city, before they are presented before the city’s current Prince. You want to emphasize the atmosphere of
unrest in the city as the Kindred chafe under the iron
hand of a tyrant, so as the characters explore the city
you plan for several encounters which will give them
firsthand experience with the Prince’s tyranny. They
might witness the brutal excesses of Primogen who
support the Prince, or their sires might call upon them

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

349

to carry messages of dissent to other powerful elders.
Perhaps they might even become involved in a blood
hunt, called on a hapless Kindred for a highly dubious
offense.
Over the course of these incidents, the characters acquaint themselves with another Kindred — an ancilla
who is cautious but eloquent in his opposition to the
current order. The characters might listen and sympathize, they might denounce him, or the coterie might
be torn along conflicting lines of loyalty and philosophy. As time passes, it becomes clear that this Kindred
seeks to claim the title of Prince for himself. The characters stand to gain status and power by supporting
the usurper, or lesser rewards from the current regime
by exposing the rebellion. You choose to leave these
events open-ended. The players are the central figures
in the chronicle and should make their own decisions,
according to their individual concepts and agendas.
Ultimately the rebellion must come to a head, and
you choose, for the interests of the story, that the rebellion succeeds, thanks to (or in spite of) the characters’
actions. Depending on the choices that they made, the
characters must meet the challenges of the aftermath.
Either they are powerful and influential members of the
new order, or they are hounded and reviled as supporters of the old regime. How the characters cope with
these changes occupies the latter half of the chronicle,
as time progresses and the new Prince sheds his noble
pretensions and is revealed as no less a tyrant than his
predecessor. Now the characters have assumed the
roles of the elders whom they envied as neonates, but
find that such lofty heights are no less fraught with
peril and constraints. In the end, the chronicle brings
the characters full circle; depending on which choices
they made in the beginning, they may find themselves
part of the oppressive regime, or charismatic firebrands
seeking support among the neonates for a rebellion of
their own.
You now have a basic outline of the overall events
in your chronicle. In addition to these major points,
smaller plotlines will be spawned by the characters’
personal goals and backgrounds. These subplots can be
tied to the overall plot, or they may be entirely unconnected, contributing to the whole through character
development and added conflict. For example, while
the would-be usurper gathers his support to overthrow
the Prince, he may have designs on Embracing a mortal in a key position of power at a company the Prince
controls. This mortal in question happens to be a
friend of one of the characters, or perhaps the char-

350

acters might find themselves opposed to the Embrace
on grounds of principle or personal philosophy. Some
ideas for subplots suggest themselves at the beginning
of your chronicle, provided by the characters’ backgrounds and personalities. Others arise over the course
of the game, as relationships and important decisions
influence the course of events. Incorporate as many of
these subplots into your chronicle as you feel comfortable with, because they provide alternate storylines
that add dimension to the characters and the chronicle
as a whole.
Other possibilities for chronicles and the themes
they can explore include:
• Search for Hidden Secrets: The characters could
be the brood of a single sire, or a coterie of individuals who must search out the millennia-old secrets of
the Antediluvians and identify their schemes. Themes
conducive to this kind of chronicle revolve around the
quest for power and the manipulations of unseen forces, or the temptations that vast powers make upon the
soul. The Storyteller can add elements of terror and
suspense, as the characters draw closer to horrible secrets that perhaps no one — mortal or Kindred — was
ever meant to know.
• Live Free or Die: The characters are a gang of
Anarchs rebelling against the dictates of an overbearing, authoritarian Prince (or perhaps a pack of Loyalist chafing under an oppressive Archbishop). Perhaps
they are outspoken in their defiance of the Kindred
ruler, actively fomenting disobedience and an end to
the established order. The Prince or Archbishop counters this by claiming that her authority alone keeps the
enemy at bay, bringing order and stability, which the
characters gravely threaten. Relevant themes for this
kind of chronicle can include self-will versus an imposed order, or freedom of thought and expression in
the face of oppression.
• The Cold Company of Sharks: The characters are
high-society vampires scheming to gain power and status among the ancillae and elders of a city. Power politics, intrigue, and betrayal are the order of the day, as
rivals welcome one another with cordial smiles while
their underlings wage a silent, ruthless war on the city
streets. This chronicle explores the potent themes of
trust, friendship, loyalty, and the corrupting taste of
power.
• No Place Called Home: The characters are refugees from a city torn apart by the intrigues of the Jyhad. They must find a new existence in a different

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

city, choosing to return to the heights of power they
formerly enjoyed, or perhaps to exist in seclusion and
shun the intrigues of the local Cainites. Then come indications that this city, too, is about to suffer the same
fate as their former home. Do the characters attempt to
take a stand and avert another disaster, or will they flee
again? This chronicle can explore themes like courage
and honor, friendship, or betrayal.

Sect. The characters must somehow make their way to
their former enemies, show their interests are genuine,
and overcome whatever challenges are necessary to be
accepted into the new Sect. Then they are enlisted in
a campaign to conquer their former home. Themes for
this chronicle can include greed, love, friendship, betrayal, truth, and deceit.

• Conquistadors: This chronicle tells of the triumph
or tragedy of founding a new fiefdom in a distant city.
At the bidding of either the Sabbat or the Camarilla
(or acting without the blessing of either Sect), the
characters must attempt to wrest the city from the forces, both human and supernatural, who might already
claim it. Suitable themes for such a chronicle can be
anything from the Jyhad to complex ideas revolving
around the value of “progress” versus the value of an
indigenous culture.

Courts of Crimson and
Alabaster

• The Free City: An ambitious council of Anarchs
declare a city to be free and open to Kindred and kine
alike, a place of peace where all can coexist. But can
the dream work? The characters can be the agents
working to build this daunting dream, making friends
and allies out of former enemies. Then tragedy strikes
— a misunderstanding (or outright sabotage) breaks
the truce, and friend turns against friend. Themes of
this chronicle can range from the poison of prejudice
to themes of honor, courage, and compassion.
• Golconda: Rumors emerge of a mysterious stranger,
newly arrived in the city, claiming to be a Methuselah
who has found the way to Golconda. Does she speak
the truth, or is she an agent of the Jyhad sent to divide
the city at the bidding of her masters? The characters
must find out, and along the way face the temptations
of what the mysterious figure offers. Suitable themes
for this chronicle can center on redemption, humanity,
greed, loyalty, and compassion.
• Angels of Mercy, Angels of Death: The characters rebel against the teachings of their sires, horrified
at what they have become and the means by which
they were Embraced. Defiant and headstrong, they
declare their own personal war against the creatures
who spawned them, fighting for the sake of people who
would see little difference between the Dark Angels
and the forces they do battle with. Suitable themes for
this chronicle may include honor, humanity, courage,
prejudice, and betrayal.
• Tale of Two Cities: The characters are a coterie or
pack of vampires who decide to defect to the opposing

Once you have created your central themes and detailed the course of the chronicle, you are ready to get
down to specifics about your setting and the Storyteller
characters who exist there. The outline you have developed should give you a guideline as to which characters
you need. For instance, in the example of the usurper
Prince, the Storyteller would initially develop the major vampires of the city and their holdings, as well as
details of the city’s Elysium and the current Prince.
As play progresses, the Storyteller can fill in details of
the rest of the city’s Kindred, from the up-and-comers
to the disenfranchised Caitiff, as well as mortals who
might play roles in the chronicle. The point is that
you, as the Storyteller, should not feel like you have to
generate a whole world in a single day. Figure out what
you will need for the immediate point in the chronicle,
develop those elements in detail, then work ahead to
address your future needs.
Vampire works best with well-crafted Storyteller
characters that make the chronicle potent and challenging with their actions. Storyteller characters are
the heart and soul of a chronicle, giving your landscape
life, action, and energy. Paint them in vivid detail, and
act through them to evoke emotions and ideas in your
players. The first Storyteller characters you are likely to
create will be those generated by your players’ character Backgrounds. This is a good place to start, because
the players will help you brainstorm their affiliates’ histories and characteristics. From there, the other Storyteller characters will either be logical needs for your
chronicle, or will come through the ebb and flow of
collaborative gameplay.
When creating your Storyteller characters, work
along the following guidelines:
Envision the role: Each character performs a role
in your chronicle, even down to the accountant who
crosses a dark parking lot and falls prey to a charac-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

351

ter’s hunger. Establish what role the character is to
play, then determine what qualities are necessary for
the character to fulfill the role effectively. A victim
embodies qualities of sympathy, terror, and pathos. An
antagonist, on the other hand, evokes qualities of ruthlessness, or cleverness, or even brute belligerence.
Paint a picture: Envision what the character looks
like, taking into account the qualities you have chosen. Pick out one or two characteristics that make the
character interesting to you. If you are envisioning one
of the characters’ herd, for instance, the image of a
tall, broad-shouldered man with a broken nose offers a
memorable picture, and suggests other interesting images which have appeal. The picture of a brawler helpless in a smaller Kindred’s embrace evokes the power
and horror of the vampire.
Choose a name: Carefully chosen names enhance
characters, while poor ones detract from the character
image and can lessen the overall mood of the scenes
in which the character appears. If we took the brawler
from the example above and named him Poindexter
or Dick Johnson, the players would have a hard time
getting past the name, much less appreciating the character and his plight.
Age: A character’s age is significant when creating
vampire characters for your chronicle. Immortality
wears away at all the ties that connect vampires to the
mortal life they once knew. For the Kindred, each year
separates them further from mortal society, as their
experiences and ambitions broaden and their perspectives become increasingly alien. A vampire who has
existed and schemed for millennia has no more regard
for the mortal societies she coldly manipulates than a
beekeeper has for his hives.
Personality: Choose one or two words that embody
the character’s personality. The Natures and Demeanors provided for character creation are a good starting
point, but don’t feel constrained by them — you can
expand your repertoire of archetypes as needed. To
make interesting characters, consider choosing personality types that seem to run counter to the “role”
that you intend them to play in your chronicle. For example, if you are envisioning a master villain who will
haunt the player characters at every turn, you could
challenge the players’ expectations and make the character friendly, outgoing, even compassionate — someone who believes that destroying the characters is a
regretful necessity, but one that will benefit everyone
in the long run.

352

Past History: Every significant character in your
chronicle benefits from some amount of past history.
What conflicts has the character faced; whom has she
loved or hated? Are there enemies or former lovers out
there who might cross paths with the players’ characters at some point? Did the character have a mentor,
and how did that relationship affect the character? Establish a character’s past history in as much detail as
you deem relevant to the chronicle. A character who
performs very limited roles, like a street contact or a
mortal family member, might not merit as much detail,
whereas the course of a century-old Archbishop’s existence could benefit from a record of the Kindred’s past
experiences.
Quirks: Everyone, mortal or Kindred, has quirky
habits accumulated over time. Whether it’s drinking
milk right out of the carton or only feeding on a mortal
to the music of Die Fledermaus, individual quirks further define characters and make them memorable.
Weaknesses: Nobody’s perfect. All people have
weaknesses or character flaws against which they struggle. This is especially important with regards to major
adversaries. Villains who do nothing wrong, make no
mistakes, and are afraid of nothing are not only discouraging but boring as well. Blind spots or flaws provide chinks in a villain’s armor that the characters can
exploit, or give an extra level of pathos to a heroic
character who must battle not only external demons,
but internal ones as well.
Statistics: Many Storytellers do this last. Storyteller
characters do not have to be constructed along the
careful lines of a player’s character. You can assign a
Storyteller character whatever dots and skills you wish.
At the end of the day, though, if the characters aren’t
unique and interesting, the best set of numbers in the
world won’t do any good for your chronicle.

The Prelude
A person’s past is the foundation on which his personality is built. For that reason, players often like to
have some idea of their character’s life before the Embrace, the better to understand who he is. The prelude
is something of a one-on-one mini-story — just you
and the player, roleplaying events from the character’s
life before the actual start of the chronicle. This serves
as a storytelling device that can help detail his mortal
existence and personality up until the point that the
first story begins.

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

“You meet your old boyfriend for lunch at the old café
you used to visit. The place has gone downhill since then
— or maybe you just romanticized it in your memory.
He’s wearing a nice suit — apparently law’s paying off
well for him — but he looks ragged around the edges, like
he hasn’t been getting much sleep. Halfway through lunch,
he admits to having problems with his wife. How do you
respond?”

It may seem odd to be playing through perfectly
mundane scenes in the prelude, but these actually
build a sense of normalcy that can be shattered when
the supernatural takes the stage. Once you juxtapose
the tedium of mortal life with the suddenly horrific attack, Embrace, and subsequent rebirth as a vampire,
the dramatic tension of becoming one of the undead
is exhilarating.

Each player undergoes the prelude alone with the
Storyteller; the one-on-one format helps concentrate
the feeling that the prelude is very personal — the
character’s past and his alone. It’s possible for two
characters to share part of a prelude, but this should be
done only if they were friends and spent a lot of time
together before the Embrace. Don’t worry too much
about neglecting the other players during the prelude;
although you should certainly make every effort to involve everyone when the game proper begins, a little
anticipation can whet the appetite for what’s to come.

Even as you describe things, let the player interrupt
with his own ideas and details concerning the events as
they occur. Remember, you’re telling this story together; the player is your partner in this. You can also throw
in details that provoke the player’s emotions — “Your
girlfriend has tears in her eyes as she tells you that she’s
pregnant” — once the character becomes a vampire,
he can’t really be there for her or their baby anymore.
Vampire is a horror game at heart, and the player must
feel a profound sense of loss to truly understand what
it’s like to be one of the Damned.

It’s okay to take a much heavier hand in controlling
the action. Give the player plenty of decisions to make,
and don’t spread them out over a long period of time
— make him think quickly, so that he goes for the instinctive reaction. Unless you want to spend an entire
evening on each character’s prelude (which makes for
more detailed characters), you should compress things
so that the character gets a more concentrated feel of
what his life was like. It’s certainly potent that way.

“The shabby man shoves you against the subway doors.
You try to scream, but there’s nobody in the car to hear
you. The lights flicker overhead. The noise of the train
pounds in your ears, and the terrible reek of your attacker
makes you want to faint. Then you feel his teeth in your
neck, and the world starts to fade away.”

Let the player explore both the setting and the rules
during his prelude. He probably shouldn’t get involved
in any combat during the prelude; if it seems to be necessary, then simply describe the results of any fights. It
won’t do to kill the character before the game begins!
“It’s a November afternoon, but it’s already sliding
into twilight. You were supposed to meet your sister at the
park, but it’s been half an hour and she still hasn’t shown
up. You hear a dog bark somewhere in the distance, and
the sound suddenly makes you realize that you’re all alone
— there isn’t another human being anywhere within view.
Except one, maybe — a derelict, stumbling down the walk
toward you. What do you do?”
You want to let the player explore the setting as well
as the rules. Have him try out a few rolls. Let him swap
a few Traits around if it becomes clear during the prelude that his Traits don’t accurately reflect the character. Find out why he has the Backgrounds that he does
— introduce his allies as characters, or visit his job (if
any) to reinforce how he gets rent money.

Finally, don’t forget that a character’s Embrace
should be roleplayed — this moment, more than
anything else, can define how he will be changed by
existence as a vampire. Play up the sensation of being watched. Build the tension of an unseen predator
stalking the unwitting character. Although the player
knows what’s coming, he shouldn’t know exactly how;
describe the attack in great detail so that it seems all
the more real and frightening. Carefully play through
the transformation. Let the player feel the trauma of
the change. Although you may still want to play out
some details of the character’s existence as a vampire
before the chronicle opens, you want the player to remember the Embrace for a long time to come.

Questions and Answers
The following questions are meant to be used by the
player as a springboard to fill out the character’s background as much as possible. Even if there isn’t time for
a detailed prelude, players can try to answer as many of
these questions as possible, either in writing or as part
of a conversation with you and the other players at the
table. You can also use them as a good guide for the
kinds of details that a prelude should touch on.

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

Into the Fire
You have outlined the chronicle you want to tell,
as well as built the world and detailed the characters
who inhabit it. You have watched your players create
their characters, helped them with their preludes, and
enmeshed their ideas with your own to give the players
their own stake in your creation. Now it’s time to begin
the tale. Here is where all that background work will
pay off and let you concentrate on telling your stories
in the best way you can.
With the outline of your chronicle in mind, establish
the events that bring each character into the coterie,
pack, or brood. Many Storytellers prefer simply to talk
over these details, make some assumptions with the
players, and then get right to the action. Others prefer
going into detail, allowing both players and Storyteller
to explore significant events in their characters’ development. Introducing the characters to one another and
watching their relationships forged over the course of
the first story can give the players greater insight into
the chemistry of the group and set the stage for possible
conflicts.
The way in which a group of characters can be
brought together depends in part on the type of coterie
that they are to form. Some examples are:
• The Sire’s Ready Hand: A powerful vampire has
carefully chosen the characters to form a group of talented and efficient agents. Each individual is chosen
for her talents and mortal connections and brought
into the brood, though sometimes Kindred from other
Clans can be “adopted” into the coterie if their abilities
are particularly useful. Members of such a coterie are
sometimes brought into the group against their wishes,
usually through coercion or manipulation, which can
be the nucleus of a story.
• Spirits of Like Mind: Vampires are by nature territorial and solitary creatures, but this doesn’t mean
that they cannot form relationships based on common
interests and shared experiences. Such a coterie could
comprise very diverse characters and Clans, linked together by a common belief or crisis. Suppose a group of
neonates find themselves thrown together when their
territories are raided by the Sabbat? Conversely, the
characters might be relatively weak vampires who decide to ally themselves to carve out hunting grounds of
their own in opposition to more powerful but solitary
Kindred. More ambitious possibilities include banding
together to supplant the city’s controlling packs, resist-

ing the perceived influence of the Jyhad, or protecting
mortal society from the depredations of vampire manipulation. The storytelling advantages of such a coterie include possible conflicts and tensions stemming
from the characters’ sense of loyalty and friendship in
the face of Clan/brood/pack ties.
• The Wild Ones: This is a classic coterie of neonate vampires who band together under a charismatic
leader and defend their hunting grounds from all comers. Most such coteries are Anarchs who are giving the
finger to the Prince, but this doesn’t necessarily have
to be the case. These coteries also lend themselves to
chronicles in which the characters are a pack of diablerists, gaining power by stalking and slaying the city’s
elders. Diablerie can be a ticket to vast power, but exacts a cost on the characters’ safety and souls.
• By Your Command: The characters are bound together at the behest of the Prince or Archbishop of the
city, ostensibly to perform a specific task or responsibility. The ties that bind them together can be as informal
as a promise and a handshake or as powerful as shared
blood. With the exception of this unifying element,
though, the characters can be entirely opposed to one
another, even mortal foes. This is easily the most difficult kind of coterie to play, requiring hard work from
players and Storyteller to find ways for the characters
to put aside their differences and work together, but it
can also make for some excellent storytelling.
• The Outcasts: The characters are pariahs, because
of their actions or their status in society, and are thrown
together simply because there is safety in numbers, and
they have less reason to be haughty. This is the typical coterie for Caitiff, but it can apply to characters
from any Clan. Perhaps the characters were set up by
a powerful and mysterious rival, and they must come
together to clear their names.
When uniting characters in a brood, coterie, or pack,
some thought must be given beforehand as to whether
or not conflict between characters will be permitted,
or if mutually agreed-upon loyalty and good relations
will be allowed to prevail. Vampires are creatures of
ambition and manipulation, and even within a coterie,
each Kindred is likely to have her own personal agenda
based upon individual backgrounds and goals. When
the individual agendas within a group are at crosspurposes, treachery and deception are powerful themes
that the Storyteller can draw upon to starkly illustrate
the ultimately solitary nature of each vampire.
Treachery within a coterie should not be forced upon
the characters simply for the sake of the chronicle; in-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

355

stead, by forming a group of vampires with potentially
opposing personal goals, the Storyteller can set out
the conditions to engender treachery and deception
amongst the coterie, and then let events take their
course. For example, consider a coterie containing a
character who is a diablerist, feeding on the vitae of
more powerful Kindred out of a sense of revenge, while
another character in the same group is a Toreador who
believes herself to be in love with a powerful Primogen.
Yet another character in the coterie might have political aspirations and is eager to court allies among the
city’s elders. Will the diablerist manipulate the Toreador to ambush and destroy the Primogen? Conversely,
might the Toreador be forced to betray the diablerist
out of love for the Primogen? Or will the political aspirant manipulate them both, assisting in the destruction
of the Primogen, then betraying the diablerist in hopes
of filling the void left by the Primogen’s destruction?

Creating Stories
There are several key elements to the storytelling process which you should consider when developing your
stories. These are plot, conflict, setting, and mood.

Plot
The plot is the sequence of events and actions that
the characters follow from beginning to end. One of
the first questions you should ask yourself when sitting
down to design a story is what the plot will be. Like
your chronicle, you need to have a clear idea of where
the story will go and how you will build the action to a
satisfying end. There are two types of plots: Main plots
are stories which are integral parts of your chronicle
and move the overall story along, while subplots are
unconnected stories which may or may not have anything to do with the chronicle, but provide entertaining diversions. The best way to run a chronicle is to
intersperse subplots in between your main plots to give
you some breathing room between major events, and
to allow you to try out interesting ideas without significantly impacting the main story.
For your main plots, refer back to your chronicle outline and use it to suggest the next step that your story
needs to take. Are the characters still getting their
bearings in the city and meeting its inhabitants? Perhaps they should be sent as an envoy from their sire
to another powerful vampire, where they might detect

356

the first hints of unrest under the oppressive hand of
the city’s Prince, setting the stage for the themes you
wish to explore. The outline that you created for the
chronicle is there to give you guideposts in creating
and directing the flow of your main plots.
With subplots, anything goes. Perhaps they encounter a band of vampire-hunters who make up for skill
and knowledge with a little reckless enthusiasm and a
lot of homemade weapons. If the characters are becoming a little cavalier about their undead existence, you
can create a story involving a mortal family member
or lover who has run afoul of the Kindred. Subplots
are good for experimentation and as transition pieces
between one major plot and another, or run parallel
to the main story you are telling. If enough detail has
been devoted to the creation of the players’ characters, many of the stories you create can have additional
complications for individual members of the coterie.
By working a character’s background (or current relationships) into your stories, you further enmesh the
player’s ideas into the chronicle and actively involve
that player in telling the story.
Any plot should be able to have its central idea
summed up in a few short sentences. For example:
• The coterie is sent to negotiate terms with a nearby
Prince, but the Nosferatu Primogen will attempt to capture them along the way.
• The characters are approached by a mysterious Caitiff who seeks their help to investigate some disappearances
among the homeless herds.
• The characters’ Ductus makes his move to depose the
current Archbishop.
If you cannot explain the main idea of the story in a
couple of sentences, you are probably trying to do too
much at one time. Focus your ideas into one or two
central actions, and then develop the course of these
events.

Conflict
After determining the plot for your story, you then
must concentrate on the central conflict. Conflict
is the obstacles or opposing forces that the characters must overcome to resolve the plot. Conflict can
stem from many sources, both within and without the
troupe. Suppose the characters’ sire has ordered the coterie to eliminate several key mortal servants of a rival
Kindred. The characters must overcome the mortals’
bodyguards and other security measures, while working

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

within the restrictions of the Masquerade — and then
there are ethical considerations. Characters with high
Humanity could object to what is essentially a series of
cold-blooded assassinations while those with low Humanity or on a Path may consider it merely efficient,
which creates conflict both within the character group
and without. More than any other kind of conflict,
moral conflict presents the characters with an obstacle
that they can’t simply overcome with brute force. It
makes them think, and that’s the best kind of challenge there is.
Conflict can be created in any number of combinations. Some obvious sources include:
• The Clash of Kindred: Vampires are ever at odds
with one another, competing for hunting grounds, political influence, and more.

• Trials of Tyranny: Power corrupts. All too often
the powerful Princes and Archbishops of a city abuse
their authority for their own ends, causing all manner
of tragedy.
• The War of the Undead: The Camarilla and the
Sabbat represent different visions of the world, and the
two are locked in a bitter battle for supremacy. Cities
across Europe and America are battlegrounds for these
longtime enemies.
• The Terror of the Wilds: The Kindred are not
the only creatures to hunt the night. The wilderness is
home to the werewolves, a race of shapeshifters whose
rage is terrible to behold. From time to time their campaign against the Kindred finds its way onto their enemies’ home streets.

• The Feuds of Clans or Packs: On a greater scale,
the Clans or packs of a city often come into conflict
over territory, resources, or simply prejudice. Internecine struggles within a Sect can be as vicious as any war
between Sects.

• The Weight of the Mask: Maintaining the Masquerade is the one iron law of the Camarilla, one which
even the most despotic Prince would not dare to break.
Sometimes action must be taken to keep the secrets of
the Kindred, and while the risks are great, the rewards
can be greater.

• The Onus of Authority: Younger generations fear
and resent the power of their elders, and Anarchs with attitude but little wisdom chafe under the rule of a Prince.

• Hounds and the Hunter: Certain mortal agencies
suspect the existence of vampires, and are determined
to hunt them down.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

357

• The Soul of the Beast: The Beast is real, raging,
and wearing away at every vampire’s self-control. The
battle against the monster within is central to every
vampire’s existence, and is a universal conflict that
should permeate every chronicle to some degree.

Setting and Mood
With the plot and its conflicts firmly in mind, you
can consider the elements of the setting and mood for
your story. Setting is as important a consideration for
each story as it is for the chronicle as a whole; wellchosen details can evoke images and impressions that
enhance the impact of the tale you want to tell. Try
to make the setting echo the feelings that you find to
be appropriate to the story. For instance, suppose you
wish to have the characters enter the lair of a powerful
Nosferatu. Because of the way you envision the lair and
the creature who lives there, you want the players to
feel a sense of helplessness and despair:
The steps of the shelter are crowded, even at midnight.
Homeless derelicts sit singly or in small groups, muttering
to one another and watching the street with furtive, glassy
eyes. Past the weathered wooden doors is a wide hall filled
with silent, still forms. Some sleep, clutching trash bags
filled with their worldly belongings and wrapped in layers
of grimy clothes. Others sit on the cots or against the
walls, staring into space, their expressions lost, as if struggling to remember who they were and how they came to
this cheerless existence. Across the room, past the cold and
empty pots of the soup line, lies a dark doorway and the
stairs that lead down into the vampire’s chambers.
Creating the mood for the story (such as the ones
presented on p. 15) goes hand-in-hand with choosing your setting, because it relates again to the kind of
atmosphere you want to convey to the players. If the
setting consists of evocative surroundings for the story,
the mood is the way in which you choose to describe
the surroundings, and the actions of the characters in
them. The secret to evoking a proper mood is to emphasize details that paint the picture you want to convey, while minimizing others. For example:
(Fear) The children stare at you with eyes that are glassy
and round from shock. They scamper away as you approach, whimpering as they retreat into the shadows. All
of them avoid the iron door looming at the other end of the
cellar.
(Anger) Someone in the crowd screams, a sound of pure
rage, and then a bottle smashes against the side of a car. A

358

storefront window shatters, and then the sounds of fists and
clubs thudding into flesh echo down the street.
(Loneliness) The theater had once seen days of glory;
now its grand marquee is dark, and the windowpanes in
the ticket booth are long since broken. Along one wall, yellowed posters linger under grimy glass panes, celebrating
the premiere of blockbusters and sultry starlets now lost to
time.
(Despair) They built the boardwalk at the turn of the
century for lovers and children, with brightly painted carnival rides and seaside stands selling candy and confections,
or offering prizes to tempt an eager suitor. Now the rides
are rusted and dull, their skeletons creak in the cold sea air,
and the only souls haunting the graffiti-stained shacks are
the derelicts, caring for nothing more than a little shelter and
a place to drink.
A carefully-chosen setting and clear details hit the
players in the gut, getting under their skin and giving
them memorable images that make the gaming experience more tangible and immediate.

Scenes
Once you have a strong grasp of these elements, you
have to put them together into individual scenes that
hook the players, set the stage for the action, build the
action to a climax, then resolve the story in a way that
ties up any loose ends and sets the stage for the next
story.
The Hook: The first step in any story is to involve
the characters and pique their interest. The hook can
be a stranger appealing to the characters for help, a
summons to the court of the Prince, or the witnessing of a sudden and startling event. Storytellers should
create their story hooks to appeal directly to the characters’ personality and backgrounds. For instance, a
character who was a detective in her mortal life can
be drawn into a story by a baffling murder or theft that
sets the events of the story in motion. If a character has
political ambitions, she would be drawn into a story
that hints at opportunities for advancement or leverage against her competition.
Setting the Stage: Once you have the characters interested, you have to draw them into the story and set
out the challenges that lie ahead. Don’t lay all your
cards on the table at once; the best way to keep players curious is to give them only a piece of the puzzle
at a time. Let them have a sense of what they need
to accomplish, an immediate objective toward achiev-

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

ing their goal, and give them hints of what might lie
beyond. If the players are smart, they will try to look
ahead and figure out where their characters’ actions
will lead them. If not, they will be open to all sorts
of plot twists and complications to make their unlives
interesting.

to play out the aftermath of a story, letting the players
see the consequences of their decisions and the effects
of their characters’ work. This denouement helps build
the sense of a bigger picture while sustaining players’
interest and curiosity.

For example, suppose the characters learn of a child
who has been kidnapped by an unknown Kindred. The
characters might be drawn to save the child for diverse
personal reasons (one character might feel strongly
about protecting children, another might be obsessed
with feeding on the child, still another might want to
rescue the child simply to thwart the plans of the kidnapper), but in the beginning, all the information they
have is the child’s identity and accounts describing the
kidnapping. From there they must learn the identity of
the kidnapper and the kidnapper’s motives, which can
add new implications to the story. What if the kidnapper is a powerful Primogen whose favor the characters
have been courting for some time? Do they thwart his
plans and forfeit their previous efforts?

Dancing with the
Dead

Building the Action: As the players progress, the
challenges the characters face should become increasingly difficult, with perhaps a few surprises thrown in
to complicate things. When you design a story, throw
in some hidden complications that the players don’t
know anything about and can be learned only with a
little initiative and forethought. For example, the man
the characters want to kidnap might have recently invested in several highly-paid bodyguards, or the Kindred who is supposed to be providing the characters
with information and assistance might be blood-bound
to someone else. Try to pull the rug out from under
the players at least once during the story, though allow them the chance to head off the problem if they
use their heads and are resourceful. As the difficulties
increase and the tensions mount, you can build the action to a dramatic finale.
The Climax: Your ultimate finale must be worth the
effort the characters went through to get there. This is
a golden rule of storytelling. Anticlimaxes work fine in
books, but not when a group of people has put in hours
of effort to reach a goal. The more the players and their
characters have to endure, the more dramatic the climax has to be, or they will come away disappointed.
Resolution: Also known as cause and effect, this
is the point in the story where the characters see the
effects of their actions and resolve any loose ends or
questions which came up along the way. If possible, try

It is not enough to design a good story — it must be
well told, presented with detail and energy. When you
tell your story, strive to make the most of the following
qualities:
Description: Make each scene vivid with detail. The
quality of your descriptions affects everything from
the mood you want to convey to the action of a brutal firefight. Describe people, places, and activities in
a way that engages all of your players’ senses. It isn’t
enough to say, “After a few hours stalking the streets,
you feed on a mortal leaving from work.” Instead, say
“The streets are rimed with patches of dirty gray ice,
and a knife-sharp December wind howls between the
tall buildings. You keep to the shadows, stalking the
alleys and the silent parking garages — anywhere that
a lone mortal might stray. You force your lungs to draw
in great gusts of air, wincing at the reek of car exhaust
and rotting trash while you search for the telltale hint
of warm flesh and blood. Hunger sharpens your senses,
narrowing your focus to one single set of impressions
— the sight, sound, and smell of your prey. Suddenly
you hear the hollow echo of footsteps, a single pair of
feet crossing the concrete floor of a garage. The Hunger
claws at you as you start to run.” Sometimes it’s better
to gloss over an unimportant event and move on, but
in general the more detail you can give, the easier the
scene is to envision, and the more alive it becomes.
Characterization: Make your Storyteller characters
individuals. This is much harder for you than for the
players, because they only have one character to concentrate on, while you have an entire city. The amount
of attention you can give to each character depends on
how important she is to your chronicle. Major characters should be treated with all the depth and detail of a
player’s character. Get inside their heads and use their
histories to determine what kind of personality that
they might have. Give them hates, fears, and hobbies.
For minor characters, single out a few distinguishing

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

359

characteristics. Make them absent-minded, or abrasive,
or neurotic. Don’t be afraid to use little quirks that you
might observe about people in everyday life. Also, make
your Kindred characters vampires. They are undead,
their bodies pale and cold, and their personalities flavored by their origins in civilizations that are hundreds,
even thousands of years old. Incorporate manners of
speech, modes of dress, or customs that the character
would have had ingrained into her in her mortal life.
Dialogue: This goes hand-in-hand with characterization, and it is possibly the most important skill a Storyteller must master. When characters talk to one another
in the game, act out the conversation. You can bring out
more depth to your characters and make the experience
more immediate with dialogue, expression, and body
language. Give each character a distinctive voice and
mannerisms appropriate to her personality. Acting out
dialogue doesn’t come easily — it takes a quick mind and
some improvisational skills, and a little bit of courage if
you are self-conscious. Don’t get stressed — you’re playing a game with friends. Encourage the players to participate, even give an extra experience point at the end
of each session for good interplay if you want. Conversation is an art and a skill, and it gets better with practice.
Action: The World of Darkness is cold and brutal,
and vampires are the epitome of the human predator.
Make your action scenes dynamic and explosive —
bones crunch, blood sprays, guns thunder, and objects
blow apart under a hail of bullets. Keep the dice-rolling
in combat scenes to a minimum, interpret the results
quickly, and then launch into pulse-pounding description. “The Brujah leaps over the bar with a howl and
swings the bat one-handed at Clive. The aluminum
club hits him in the mouth with a crunch of bone and
a spray of blood and enamel, knocking Clive off his
feet.” The key element is the intensity of the experience. Don’t be afraid to fudge results sometimes to
keep the action and pace at a fever pitch.
Mystery: Keep the players guessing. Never show
them the full picture of what is going on. One of the
fundamental facts of Kindred existence is that knowledge is power and the key to survival. Nothing in the
World of Darkness is quite what it appears to be, and it
is good to emphasize this point with plot twists, betrayals, and hidden complications to your stories.
Influencing Events: Vampire is about telling a good
story, which requires careful planning and an idea of
where the events of your chronicle are leading. The
problem is that sometimes the players will throw you

360

a curve ball. Perhaps they will miss the obvious clue
that will expose the central mystery of the chronicle,
or maybe they will go in a totally unexpected direction
and stumble onto a part of the story that they weren’t
supposed to deal with yet. Worse yet, one of them
gets a lucky hit in battle and kills off the major villain
whom you had planned to be their major adversary for
the next 12 stories.
There are no easy solutions to these situations, but
basically you have two courses of action to choose from:
Roll with the punches and adapt to the changes, or use
your godlike powers to avoid the problem entirely. The
best rule of thumb is to fudge events directly only if it
enhances the game as a whole. If the characters miss a
vital piece of data, steer them back to it. If you would
rather see your major villain killed off in a more dramatic way, fudge his soak rolls and let him limp away.
Still, use this sparingly. It is your privilege as the Storyteller, but if you abuse it you will convince the players
that their characters can’t really succeed at anything,
which ruins the game. The best stories are the ones
told collaboratively, and the players should feel like
they have a real impact on how each story unfolds.

Ten Pieces of Storytelling Advice
The art of storytelling is a process, like any
artistic endeavor, and at first it seems like an
overwhelming task. The main elements to
remember, though, can be broken down into
five “dos” and five “dont’s”: ten easy pieces of
advice to keep in mind at the table.
Do:
• Involve the Players Whenever Possible.
Incorporate their ideas and backgrounds
into your city and chronicle. This will take
some of the burden of world-building off
your shoulders and give the players more of a
stake in the story you are telling. Ultimately,
the players should be the most important —
though not necessarily the most powerful —
denizens of your chronicle.
• Accommodate the Players’ Expectations.
It’s their game too. You need to have some
idea of what kind of game the players want to
play before developing your chronicle.

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

• Be Prepared. You don’t have to have
everything worked out, but even some notes
ahead of time works wonders, and gives you
more time to spend at the table presenting
the story to your players.
• Prioritize Story over Rules. Your tale
shouldn’t get held back by the rules. You can
make or break the rules as you see fit, if doing so enhances the story and makes it more
enjoyable for the players.
• Use Description, Dialogue, and Action.
Make your world come alive with vibrant
description, involving sights, smells, taste,
and touch. Encourage roleplaying by acting
out conversations, using different voices to
individualize your characters. Keep the pace
and intensity high with dynamic action.
Don’t:
• Overuse Stereotypes: Every once in a
while a stereotype helps to move the action
along, but nothing drains the life out of your
chronicle faster than an endless parade of
identical, cardboard characters.
• Forget the Payoff: If the players work hard
and make smart decisions, their characters’
success must be in proportion to the challenges they have faced, or they will feel cheated.
• Tell Them Everything: Much of the challenge in a game is in the mystery, the parts of
the story that you hold back for the players
and their characters to discover on their own.
• Abuse Your Power: You are the final arbiter of events. Your word is law, but you cannot use this authority to beat the characters
into doing what you want them to do. It is a
game, it’s for fun, and everyone should have
a good time, whether it follows the script or
not.
• Panic: If the players pull the rug out from
under you, don’t be afraid to call a break and
take some time to collect your thoughts. Even
veteran Storytellers sometimes need to take a
moment and think about some new wrinkle
they hadn’t anticipated.

Storytelling Tips and
Techniques
Movies, books, and television use a variety of tricks
that can be adapted easily to the realm of dramatic storytelling. Directors, writers, and editors use techniques
like these to heighten their story’s clarity, to manipulate our emotions, and heighten our fears. These
unique approaches give perspective and focus to parts
of the stories that the tales’ creators want to emphasize
and underscore.
As Storytellers, we have our own techniques, too.
These techniques provide you with similar benefits
to those that creators of non-interactive media have.
Storytellers are always looking for ways to make their
games less static, more dramatically satisfying, and
more distinctive. Here are some that have worked for
Vampire Storytellers over the past twenty years, as well
as some new ones based on what we’ve learned.
These tips and techniques can enrich your chronicle
dramatically. Use your imagination and don’t ever be
afraid to try something new or different. They may
not be easy but, because they make you think in emotional comparisons and contrasts, they’ll add depth to
a chronicle in ways that are poignant, visual, and fulfilling.

Downtimes
Downtime (sometimes called “blue-booking”) is a
storytelling technique that allows offstage action (also
called “downtime”) to be explored in greater depth.
It’s a solo participation technique in which a player
tells the Storyteller, in narrative form, about what happens during a bit of offstage business. Often, interesting
action takes place outside of the main plot line that
you may wish to explore with a single player or with a
small group of them. Downtime gives them a writing
assignment to tell you, in first-person form, about what
happens to their character offstage at that particular
moment.
This technique doesn’t have to be used only to keep
direct and indirect actions secret. It can also be used
to play out the details of more personal material, and
even material that’s adult-oriented and might be embarrassing to the rest of the group. (Sexual material can
be played out this way, especially if the majority of the
troupe is uncomfortable with it, but adult-oriented ma-

terial isn’t just limited to sex.) Downtime can also be
used to highlight a character’s backstory and successfully keep the game from slowing down because not
everyone is directly involved in the action.
Some players email or write down their downtimes
to give directly to the Storyteller. Others keep blogs,
wiki pages, or some other method of presenting their
character downtimes in a way that other players (and
even those who aren’t playing in the chronicle) can
read and enjoy. Whether this is acceptable to the other players or the Storyteller depends on the individual
troupe — some prefer to keep information secret so as
not to spoil the surprise, while others consider it more
like a scene in which the other players are spectators
rather than participants, allowing them to enjoy the
ongoing story as audience members.

Cut Scenes
A cut scene is a storytelling technique that enhances
a story by jumping between two bits of simultaneous action that can be directly related to each other, in direct
opposition in emotion and tone or both. When used in
horror or suspense, they’re extremely effective if they
juxtapose the monstrous nature of a specific plot point

362

with something innocuous or even joyous. This technique underscores the horror and makes it seem even
more terrible because it’s contrasted with something
that’s pointedly not horrific. When used in a chronicle,
a Storyteller can use a cut scene to enhance the direct
action of the plot and quickly take it elsewhere — to
another simultaneous bit of direct action that contrasts
with the previous action. This enhances the emotional
tone of the original scene and counterpoints it.
How do you use this technique in your chronicle?
Maybe you want to underscore terror and despair as a
particular character is Embraced. You could alternate
the direct action, the Embrace, and all the stalker-versus-prey games that lead up to it, with scenes from the
character’s background, such as scenes of home, friendship, and love. By “quick-cutting” between images of
death (the moment of capture, the tearing of clothing,
fangs ripping into skin, the slow, tortuous draining of
precious vitae) and scenes of life (horsing around in the
grass with friends during a scrub football game, taking
an erotically charged shower with a lover, laughing with
friends at a Friday-night bar rendezvous), you can make
the terror of Embrace all the more vivid and emphasize
the fact that this loss is immediate and life-ending.

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

Try different approaches by enlisting the services of
other players to play the “bit parts” in a scene; try using
cut scenes to bring the metaphorical tone of your scene
back to your chronicle’s theme by making the “cut-to”
images representative of that theme. Use them to show
the similarities and differences between the playercharacters and your Storyteller characters by cutting
back and forth between your troupe’s actions and the
supporting cast’s actions. Use your imagination, think
about your theme, concept, and mood, and pick “cutto” and “cut-from” images that represent your theme
and concept visually and emotionally. By using this
technique, you can draw the plot action and the emotional tone of your chronicle into a cohesive whole.
Cut scenes are very difficult to use without bogging
down the story. They require great effort on the part of
the Storyteller to handle the rapid shifts in perspective,
and they require dedication on the part of the players
to give the situation their full attention. Otherwise,
the scene has the potential to fall flat or be awkward.

Flashbacks
Flashbacks are storytelling devices that take scenes
that happened in the past and tell them in a whole,
cohesive moment. While cut scenes can draw from
backstory to underscore a particular piece of chronicle
action happening in the now, flashbacks tell that past
moment in its entirety. Flashbacks can also be complete
stories themselves (stories that may not even be drawn
from the pasts of the initial scene’s characters) that tell
something about what is happening to the characters
now. Flashbacks are a technique of visual and emotional foreshadowing or allegory that works because they
tell the direct scene’s characters something about what
is happening to them. You can use them to add flesh
to the bones of your troupe characters’ backgrounds by
playing through them, as well as to foreshadow problems that your troupe characters’ are facing.
Flashbacks can impart insight to the players by showing what happened to the flashback scene’s participants.
You can use flashbacks to give your troupe characters
epiphanies and enlightenment, and you can connect
those character insights to your chronicle’s theme, concept, and mood. Flashbacks are a very valuable technique to use in horror because you can use them to
impart a sense of immediate danger, despair, and fear.
You can use them to show your troupe the face of the
enemy, and add to their fear because they’ve seen what
the enemy has done before. Additionally, they can be
used to underscore direct chronicle action in much the

same way that the cut scene can, but to tell an extended
version of the contrasting action. Try different mixes
— tell complete stories or whole singular scenes with
dialogue. Try using them to tell related stories that contrast with your main story. It’s up to you.
For instance, maybe the pack is in league with a
particular up-and-comer in the local Sabbat hierarchy. The direct action of a certain scene involves the
troupe meeting with the Archbishop to participate in
a ritual at the Archbishop’s haven where the up-andcomer plans to “expose” a rival as a traitor. Perhaps one
of the characters is a Malkavian antitribu with Auspex
and, after an interlude with the politico, he touches
her shoulder to get her attention. This touch imparts
a vision to the Malkavian that tells him a whole story
about exactly what she’s done to frame the rival for her
own betrayal of the Archbishop. As the Storyteller,
you use the flashback technique to draw all the other
characters into a first person narrative of the betrayal
and the frame-up. You play the real traitor and work to
show a complete picture of her activity and pull your
players into the action by simply assigning them the
fill-in roles on the spot. After you use this technique to
show what’s happened in the past, you break the vision
and pull the action back into the present by bringing
the room back into direct focus. What you’ve done is
shown, rather than told, the players that the politico
is a lying, cheating bastard and a danger to the Archbishop in a way that’s infinitely better than just telling
the Malkavian that “your Auspex roll shows that the
politico is the real traitor.”
It’s tricky, but it works.

Dream Sequences
The dream sequence is a storytelling device that uses
the dream state to impart story information. Think
about it: vampires dream just like everyone else (maybe
more so, because the older they get, the longer they
“sleep” in torpor), and dreams seek to purify the subconscious mind by emptying it of troubling, disturbing
thoughts. While dreams can be pleasant, they can also
be awful and terrifying. A character’s slumber allows
you, the Storyteller, to play all sorts of nasty, paranoid, heinous, or even uplifting and unlife-changing
games that draw the characters’ fears, hopes, and ambitions into the panorama of your chronicle. You can
use dream images that are prophetic, foreshadowing
something that will happen to the coterie, or you can
use them as simple worries and fears that play out in a
way that will never actually happen. Remember that

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

363

dreams are largely symbolic; sometimes they impart information in ways that are totally unintelligible.
A Storyteller can use dreams to spectacular effect.
In a dream, you can show the characters their mistakes
and magnify them. You can then show them their successes, and make those successes seem microscopic
in comparison with their mistakes. Dreams are also a
great vehicle for bringing in visual references to the
Merits and Flaws your participants choose. Does one of
the characters have the flaw Nightmares? Give him the
flavor of the worst possible outcome of that Flaw amplified in a dreamscape. You can use dream sequences
to impart a sense of purpose to your characters, or you
can even use dreams to give the characters a particular
challenge or quest. You can comfort a character with
images of forgotten acquaintances living their lives
happily and reach back to draw the character into
close camaraderie for a bittersweet, nostalgic interlude,
or you can tease him with weird, Dalí-esque images
of everything he aspires to be as a vampire, placing
his feet on that path for the first few tentative steps.
Then, when night falls, you let them wake in a sheen
of blood-sweat to tremble out of their havens and look
at the enchanted picture of the world you’ve drawn for
them with new insight… and paranoia.

Parallel Stories
This technique takes the players and puts them into
the ancillary plot of the chronicle and lets them look
at it from a different viewpoint. Parallel stories can also
be used to tell a separate but connected story that runs
alongside your main plot line.
Parallel stories are interesting because they give you
and your troupe a breather from the primary plotline
of your chronicle. It gives the story new life because it
allows players to see their impact on the world through
others’ eyes. It also allows the players to change the
face of the chronicle as they change their own faces under the guise of new personas. Parallel stories can also
help support the emotional subtext of your chronicle
by connecting those stories to a supporting cast drawn
from the main characters’ backgrounds. However, they
work well in a variety of other instances as well.
Storytellers can give information from the main story
to the parallel characters and then connect them to the
main characters. Parallel stories’ characters can create
a sense of tension and opposition by placing themselves
directly in the path of the players’ main characters and
giving the parallel characters a sense of what monsters
the primary characters have become. For instance, the

364

ancillary characters could be witch-hunters hot on the
trail of the coterie, provided skilled storytelling allows
the players to doubt the wellbeing of their original
characters. This technique also allows the players to
flesh out their ghouls, retainers, and childer and gives
them insight into those supporting characters. In this
way, a Storyteller can show the daylight hours, when
the main characters are asleep, instead of simply skipping over the daytime.
Parallel stories also give another perspective to the
results of certain Disciplines, like Dementation, by
placing the player whose character caused the Dementation literally inside their victim’s mind, painting the
picture of what madness can be much more vividly.
Additionally, a hunter chronicle can illustrate the
sorts of lives that the coterie can never live — and,
ironically, the obsession which drives the hunters, forever removing them from “normal” lives. Recognize
the potential of this device for your chronicle, connect
it to your theme and concept, and then let it illustrate
the mood of the piece by comparison or contrast to the
main plot action.

Boot Camp
Boot camp is a technique where the players play
mortal characters for an extended period of time. It
folds the characters’ human backgrounds into the beginning of the chronicle more centrally than preludes
often can. It can be viewed as an extended prelude because all the characters start play as mortals, and they
very possibly play through a whole story arc as mortals.
This technique has value because it adds substance to
characters by forcing players to start their characters as
people and exploring all the changes vampirism imposes on them. It’s a more thorough way for your troupe
to get a handle on their characters than by just starting
them with a short prelude, because they must evolve as
people and then evolve as vampires. It helps the players explain why their vampires are the way they are,
without just assuming it. It isn’t for everybody — many
troupe members want to jump directly into the game as
vampires — but with the right group, it adds layers of
motivation to their characters by contrasting all things
human with the Curse of Caine.
This is also a viable technique for introducing special
Storyteller characters from the characters’ backgrounds
and letting those relationships evolve organically. It
can show characters the faces of their sires prior to the
Embrace and makes the hunt of predator and childeto-be much more personal. Boot camp also spawns

CHAPTER EIGHT: STORYTELLING

ideas for individual plot hooks for every character in
the coterie: It can sow the seeds of Characters’ ambitions and carry rivalries from life to unlife. The process
is much the same for the characters’ allies. It lets the
characters touch their human families and makes the
loss of those families much more poignant, giving them
a more immediate sense of how unattainable and how
lost those former lives have become. Boot camp stories drive home the difference between Humanity and
the Beast by letting characters experience the friends,
family, love interests, etc. whom they might later be
tempted to Embrace instead of abandoning.

Hunting Scenes
One of the most iconic scenes in a vampire story is
when the vampire drinks blood from her victim. Just
about any vampire novel, movie, or television show
has a scene (or scenes) in which we witness how the
vampire hunts and feeds. And yet, it’s not always an
easy scene to run for a Vampire game — if done poorly, it can be tedious, awkward, or leave the other players bored. So, rather than one technique you can use,
as with the previous sections, we’ve given you a variety
of options you can use, depending on what effect you’re
going for. You can stick with one method that your
group likes, or change and adapt based on the current
needs of your chronicle.

Quick-And-Dirty Scenes:
The One-Roll Method
The default method for hunting is detailed in Chapter
Six on p. 259. It basically boils down to a single dice roll
— success means the vampire gets blood, while failure
means she doesn’t, and a botch introduces a complication. And, as a high-level scene, that works just fine. If
your story is in the middle of a lot of different plots and
twists and the players really just want to fuel up and get
back into things, a quick dice roll or two combined with
a short bit of narration does the trick. Unfortunately,
this method can take a lot of the horror and monstrosity
out of the act of drinking blood, turning it into merely
numbers of points to be collected and spent as needed.

Detailed Scenes:
The Three-Stage Hunt
In some situations, you might want to have the player go through each step of the hunt, playing through
the conflict between hunter and prey. This method
takes more time than the single-roll structure, but can
be useful to help players get into the mindset of playing

a vampire, to add a dash of complexity in an otherwise
slow part of the story, or just to spend some more time
digging into the nature of the hunt. In this case, you
can break the scene down into three stages: the contact, the hunt, and the defeat.
The contact is the stage in which the vampire looks
for and finds a suitable target — scanning a dance floor
for a lonely date, looking for a homeless person in an
alleyway, scouring through sewers for a stray animal,
and so on. The roll itself depends on what method of
hunting the vampire is using, but it likely uses Perception, since the vampire is merely trying to find an
appropriate target that looks vulnerable at this point.
The difficulty varies, but the table on p. 260 that puts
the range of difficulty at 4-8 is a good basis. Failure
means that an appropriate target isn’t available that
scene — either there’s no one around, or all of the potential victims are too well-protected or too visible to
easily feed from. A botch at this stage isn’t too painful,
probably indicating that security is unusually high, an
unexpected party is going on, or there’s some other factor that keeps the vampire from feeding successfully in
that area for the rest of the night.
The hunt is when the vampire approaches and engages the victim, getting them into a position where the
vampire can feed. At a nightclub, the vampire might
use Subterfuge to flatter and seduce the victim into a
private corner. In an alleyway, he might use Stealth to
follow the homeless man into a dead end. And in the
sewers, the vampire may use Animal Ken to be able to
creep up on a rat without spooking it. The stakes are
higher than the contact stage, but they aren’t too high
yet: failure means that something is preventing the victim from being easily fed upon (the club girl won’t leave
her friends, the homeless man gets hassled by a police
officer, the rat scuttles back just out of reach), while a
botch means that the victim avoids the approach, sending the vampire back to searching for a new victim.
Finally, the defeat is when the vampire feeds: she
nuzzles the neck of the club girl, shoves the homeless
man against the wall, or makes a grab for the rat. At
this point, the risk is high — success means blood (as
much as the vampire wants to take, although you can
say the vampire can’t have more blood points than the
player scores successes), but failure means the victim
escapes. A botch introduces a major complication at
this point: the club kid screams and gets the attention
of everyone on the dance floor, a policeman sees the
assault and calls for backup, or the rat turns out to be
some sort of were-creature.

One way to help keep other players involved in this
kind of lengthy scene is to have them play the part of
the victim and associated characters, similar to a flashback. The victim is roleplayed based on the vampire
player’s rolls. This can not only help to get more players involved, but also add a level of emotional intimacy
to the scene as the other players help to add life to this
encounter.

Poignant Scenes:
Flashes of Life
If you want to introduce an element of humanity
into the hunt, you can use this quick rule: For every
success made on the hunting roll (either the one-roll
scene or in stage three of the hunt), the player gets one
image about the victim’s life, some emotional snapshot
that flashes through the victim’s mind as they feel the
blood leaving their body. These images can be like
photographs spliced into the “film” of your game. Some
examples:
•

A broken doll, dangling from a child’s hand.

•

The victim and his wife, laughing at the beach.

•

Holding the hand of a loved one as she lies in a
hospital bed.

•

A beloved pet curled in the victim’s lap.

This isn’t necessarily information the vampire would
know (although some powers, such as Auspex and Thaumaturgy, might make it available) — the idea is to bring
home to the player that their character is doing something terrible to a human being. You’ll probably want to
keep a list of random elements on hand to use for these
scenes, so you don’t have to improvise at the table.
For an additional level of emotional impact, you can
organize the images based on the style of feeding the
vampire is doing. An aggressive vampire attempting to
intimidate his victim might result in scenes of violence
from the victim’s past, while a more seductive scene
may bring uncomfortable moments of intimacy.

Narrative Scenes:
Something Always Goes Wrong
If a player really wants his character to get blood, he
can volunteer the vampire for a narrated feeding scene.
Effectively, the player is choosing to forgo the dice roll
for hunting, gaining as many blood points as the Storyteller will allow. In return, however, something in the
hunting scene will go wrong, as if the vampire’s player
had rolled a botch. The scene should be played out as
normal, but until the complication sets up, there’s no

366

need to roll the dice — the fate of the vampire is now
set on a particular path. These scenes add a level of
tension because they are usually called for by the player:
The situation is desperate enough that the blood is necessary, and the player is willing to accept the consequences. It also ties into the undercurrent of nihilism in
Vampire — there is no situation that can’t get worse.

The Impact of Hunger
If you want hunting scenes to come up more
often, you can press the issue of hunger (or,
if the game has hit a lull, you can simple ask
your players “Is anyone hungry?”). A hungry
vampire is more inclined to hunt, even if they
have more than one blood point remaining —
a Kindred can generally be considered hungry
when they have fewer blood points than (7
minus Self-Control or Instincts). There are a
few ways in which you can encourage players
to take their character’s hunger into account.
First, you can simply have a persistent reminder. Give each character an index card
or token, with one side labeled “Hungry” and
the other side labeled “Satiated.” The player
makes a note on her sheet of what point
her character goes hungry, and when that
number is reached, she flips the card over to
the “Hungry” side. This helps remind players (and the Storyteller) of the character’s
current state, and can also encourage players
to portray their characters accordingly. If you
need a little extra encouragement, you can try
offering a reward, such as awarding a Willpower point because vampires that indulge in
feeding while hungry reinforce their inherent
vampiric nature. Or, you can impose a small
penalty for failing to feed while hungry, such
as making all Willpower rolls +1 difficulty because the vampire is too distracted with hunger to concentrate. For some groups, though,
just the reminder is enough — it’s easy to
forget your vampire’s needs when there’s a
lot of other stuff going on, and this is a good
way to help track the vampire’s thirst and let
everyone get on with the rest of the game.

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

Chapter Nine:
The Others
"There will come a time, in the last days, when the Moon-Beasts will grow uneasy...
and so they will find us and they will kill us."
- The Book of Nod

The Kindred are not alone in calling the night their
home. Other creatures prowl the shadows and stalk the
dark places of the World of Darkness, and rarely are they
the friends of either man or vampire. This chapter describes many of these fellow supernatural denizens. While
most have plenty of reason to despise the Kindred (for
reasons from territory dispute to ancient vendetta to a
fundamental inability to understand each other), there’s
no guarantee that even the direst of enemies won’t be
able to find a common enemy or mutual interest. Storytellers, use these entries as dubious allies or implacable
enemies at your discretion. The only constant that faces
the Kindred with regard to the other night-dwellers is
that nothing can be taken at face value.

Witch-Hunters
The Kindred remember the Burning Times. Before
such things as the Camarilla and Sabbat existed, Cainites dwelled in a superstitious world of ignorant peasants, venal clergy, and decadent aristocracy. In that
age of muck and misery, few Kindred saw any reason
to heed the Tradition of the Masquerade, reasoning
that mankind had enough of its own social problems

to occupy them and would be powerless to resist local,
feudal lords of decidedly darker origin.
The retribution of mortals was swift and bloody.
Agents of the Church had no desire to see their flocks
tormented by blood-drinking minions of the Adversary,
and the nobles of the age guarded their own authority jealously. The Inquisition, an agency of the Holy
Church tasked with extinguishing heresy, took upon
itself the task of rooting out the scourge of the Damned.
All across Europe, vampires found themselves seized in
their havens, clapped into irons, and dragged before an
Inquisitor — if not burned on the spot. The subsequent
chaos stoked the War of Ages, as cagey elders sacrificed
neonates in order to buy them time while crafty ancillae led the fires of the Inquisition to the doors of their
sires for the same reason.
Some Kindred say that from the ashes of these fires rose
the ivory towers of the Camarilla and the phoenix-wings
of the wild Sabbat. Tonight, who can say how much of
the secret history is truth or myth? What remains true is
that there are those among the mortals, whether with the
zeal of the Church, the righteousness of the governments
of men, or the unquenchable thirst for knowledge of the
occult, who seek out the Kindred for their own reasons.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

369

The Society of Leopold
Historians think of the Inquisition as that frightening face the Catholic Church showed the world from
1231 to 1834. But Kindred know that the Inquisition
didn’t end in the 19th century, but endures to the present night, more fearsome than ever. Indeed, few mortals conjure dread among knowledgeable vampires the
way modern Inquisitors do.
The public at large, and even some of the Church’s
highest officials — including the Pope — know nothing of the Inquisition’s current activities, due to the
organization’s intense secrecy. The Society of Leopold,
to which it’s referred tonight, is primarily (but no longer exclusively) comprised of Roman Catholics. The
Inquisition’s “interfaith” membership devotes itself to
the eradication of vampires and other supernatural entities, an agenda the Society pursued vigorously under
the guidance of Monsignor Amelio Vittore. When the
monsignor suffered a stroke, though, the Society had to
deal with an internal crisis that had loomed gradually
under his tenure.
During that time, the godlessness of modern existence had led all but the most hot-blooded Inquisitors
to conclude that the Apocalypse was not (yet) imminent. However, every member of the Society felt certain that the Adversary’s earthly forces would attach
tremendous importance to this calendrical turning
point and possibly carry out some devastating worldwide sacrilege. A similar fin de siècle gripped much of
the mortal world, under such appellations as the “Y2K
crisis” and fear of the Mayan doomsday of 2012.
While some Leopolders feared the Savior might never return (though none ever said so), all of them recognized the real and present threat that creatures of the
darkness posed to humanity. Worse, the populace that
Inquisitors risked their lives to protect seemed ready
to emulate, even embrace, these evil beings. Morale
in the Society also suffered because of the mounting
controversy over torture, which the Monsignor himself had banned officially as an unacceptable Inquisitorial tool. Of course, unofficial and clandestine torture
was the rule for some of the Society’s members, who
saw their war as otherwise unwinnable. All this fear
and uncertainty combined to pave the way for a leader
who was sure of herself and her techniques: onetime
Austrian Ingrid Bauer, known behind her back as “The
Original Iron Maiden.”

370

Vampires never realized how relatively easy their
unlives were during the previous leadership. Granted,
through the years the venerable old Monsignor presided (directly or indirectly) over the destruction of
many Cainites and ghouls, so the prevalent Kindred
attitude toward the Inquisition then was general wariness. If you didn’t irritate the Inquisition, they were
likely to pass you by in favor of vampires brazen (or
stupid) enough to antagonize the Society purposely.
A few Kindred were even bold and clever enough to
make the Inquisition their catspaw in the Jyhad.
Now, elders trade rumors of turncoat Inquisitors who
betrayed their Cainite masters: a high-ranking Ventrue,
her Lasombra rival, and a tiny sect of renegade Nosferatu of French lineage. These Kindred and more supposedly still languish in an unknown dungeon where
they suffer tortures at witch-hunters’ hands. Neonates
whisper tales of coteries routed by sword-wielding Leopolders who display previously unknown fierceness and
skill. Most troubling to the Kindred are recent reports
of organized assaults against longtime havens, some of
them lairs that had remained inviolate since the time
of Queen Victoria.
Bauer, of course, is the force behind such activities.
Only a handful of Kindred elders have enough information to make that link, however, as an exhaustive
purge of disloyal elements from the Inquisition’s ranks
coincided with the new Inquisitor General’s rise to
power. The Society’s Censors carted off nearly every
member who was actively spying for the Kindred, a
sizable percentage of individuals “sympathetic” to the
plight of the Damned, and a few entirely innocent Leopolders who learned the true meaning of suffering for a
cause. Only a handful of moles survived this “Inquisitors’ Inquisition,” and they now live in fear of their
comrades and of belated discovery. For the most part,
these spies have abandoned their undead patrons, fearing traps that might lead to the Society’s oubliettes.
A new vigor prevails among most Inquisitors, but a
familiar malaise endures as well — in a slightly different guise. Even as Bauer sees to it that braziers are lit,
racks are oiled, and molten lead is at hand in Inquisition dungeons on five continents (Asia continues to
defy the organization), the use of torture again becomes
a thorny issue. Whereas before there was a vocal majority that wanted such methods reinstated, now there
is a silent minority that agonizes over such practices.
The real problem here is that these moral qualms are

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

actually eroding one of the Inquisition’s most powerful weapons against vampires: True Faith. This quality,
inherent to certain individuals, can repel a vampire
without the need for crosses, holy water, or any other
sacred emblem — in fact, in the hands of nonbelievers,
such items are useless against Kindred. The Monsignor
understood the soul-deadening, faith-damping effects
of using torture against any creature, even an undead
one. He saw the speedy destruction of vampires not as
murder, but as a mercy; torture, however, he considered a descent into the enemy’s repulsive cruelty.
Alas, Inquisitor General Bauer is immune to such
qualms, convinced as she is of the rightness of her crusade and her methods alike. Interestingly, she is one of
the rare Inquisitors with both extensive experience as
a torturer and impressive True Faith. Even more worrisome, especially to the strong Catholic membership
of the Order, are her claims that this “dualism” — her
word — gives her an advantage over the creatures of
the night. In their minds, the whole thing is not only
morally perilous, but strangely redolent of the heresies
of the centuries before the Burning Times.

consent the marriages of lay members whose personal
lives “intruded” upon their vigilance.

In the eyes of some of its most orthodox and devout,
the Society of Leopold has paid a price for choosing
Bauer as its leader. True, she is waging the holy war
against the Kindred and their ilk (she sees werewolves,
among others, as vampires’ tools) that most Inquisitors
wanted — and needed — to fight. With the combat
colleges she has established in Nevada’s Black Rock
Desert and in the Spanish Pyrenees, she is also improving the organization’s readiness for that war. Now,
many Inquisitors in the field carry a sword-cane or a
“gladius dei” and are quite adept in their use. Bauer
even personally instructs her subordinates in the proper techniques for organizing congregations into witchhunting mobs, even to the point of using modern media and social networks.
Unfortunately, she is unable to address her troops’
spiritual woes, which are substantial. Alcoholism, depression, and addiction to pornography are rife among
Leopolders. Plus, it’s undeniable that significant numbers of the Society’s ethical elite have split from their
fellows over the torture issue, though these highly moral
individuals have yet to take any formal action against
their fellows. As for Bauer herself, she has shown significant stress from the ongoing rigors of her position.
In the time since her ascendancy, her hair has turned
completely white, she has excommunicated some of

True Faith
True Faith is a special Trait that only a few
people in the World of Darkness possess.
While many mortals are more or less devoted
to a belief in some form of higher being or
purpose, only a small number have the burning zeal, the profound conviction that can
protect them against creatures like vampires.
Note that, while most vampire legends portray the Damned being repelled by crosses and
the like, Faith can manifest in any religious
form. A devout Jew might be able to ward off
vampires with her Star of David, or a Taoist
might be able to intone special prayers, while
a Christian lacking True Faith finds his crucifix impotent against the undead.
This Faith is not necessarily increased
through experience. Certainly, it may rise as a
result of a person’s experience, but it is more
vital than that, more a measure of conviction
and strength of mind. Nor is it something that
comes from outside the individual, from some
God or angel. Whether or not their beliefs are
correct, these people believe so unwaveringly
that their own conviction protects them. At
the Storyteller’s discretion, Faith should rise
or fall to reflect a person’s religious certainty
and zeal.
The Faith Trait has a rating of 1 to 5. Exactly
what protection is afforded to the individual
by the Trait depends on this rating, as described below. These are just guidelines,
however. Storytellers should amend them as
required to fit the tone of their chronicles, or
to add drama to their stories.
• Any character with Faith may attempt to
ward off vampires by brandishing a holy symbol or uttering prayers. The person rolls Faith
against a difficulty equal to the vampire’s
current Willpower points. The number of successes indicates the number of steps backward
the vampire is forced to take. If no successes
are scored, the vampire need not step back
but may not advance. A botch indicates that

372

the vampire may advance unhindered. Further, if the cross, Bible, or other holy symbol
is placed against the vampire’s body, each
success causes an aggravated health level of
damage, burning into the flesh.
•• A mortal with a Faith rating of 2 or more
may resist Dominate and similar vampiric
mind-control powers by spending Willpower
(one point protects for a few turns).
••• A person with a Faith of 3 or more may
be able to sense the presence of a vampire,
and can purchase the Awareness Skill. She
need not consciously try to sense a vampire’s
presence, but must be in peaceful, quiet
surroundings — perhaps alone in thought,
praying, reading the Torah, meditating on
the Bible, etc. The person will not sense the
vampire’s presence if she is preoccupied (e.g.,
arguing) or in a crowded, noisy place (jostled
by a mob, in the midst of a raucous banquet,
etc.). This ability is not infallible; the Storyteller should let the person sense the vampire
only when it is dramatically convenient, or
only after a successful Awareness roll. Note
that the person cannot know exactly what
she senses through her Faith; all that she will
know is that something unclean or evil is
nearby.
•••• The mortal may not be turned into a
ghoul, and is immune to any mind-altering
Disciplines such as Dominate, Presence, and
Obfuscate.
••••• The person is so pure, so holy, that
she can fill a vampire with self-loathing,
disgust, terror, and even physical pain. Any
vampire hearing the person pray, preach,
or recite psalms, or who is touched by the
faithful, may be forced to flee immediately.
A vampire who is unable to flee is reduced to
a gibbering wreck, flailing on the floor and
screaming, sobbing, or begging forgiveness.
To avoid fleeing, the vampire must either
expend one Willpower point per turn or make
a Stamina roll each turn (difficulty of 5 + her
own Intelligence) — the higher the vampire’s
Intelligence, the higher the difficulty, as the
more tortured and guilty she feels.

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

In theory, a mortal might have a Faith rating
of greater than 5, but these people are one in a
billion — the sort of people who are venerated
as saints. They are unlikely to enter a chronicle, but their powers would be enormous.
There is actually one easy way for a vampire
to detect a person with a Faith rating, other
than bitter experience — the use of Aura Perception can find it. A mortal with Faith has
her aura permanently altered so that she has
a silver or gold “halo” around her body. The
strength of the Faith determines the brightness of the halo.
Remember that Faith represents a person’s
total commitment to her beliefs. That person
will act accordingly. Those with high Faith
ratings may seem fanatical, even insane to
those not of their religion.
Cainites do not normally have Faith ratings,
although it is still possible (see the Merit on
p. 494).

The U.S. Government
Government in the World of Darkness tends to be
a nihilistic monolith that moves little as a whole, but
which empowers numerous individually-motivated bureaus and organizations. Given the influences exerted
by conspirators, secret societies, and assorted cabals
— and these schemers are in addition to the vampire
factions that fancy themselves masters of the puppetmasters — the efforts of all these manipulators largely
cancel each other out or run afoul of things as mundane
as bureaucratic incompetence or unswerving greed.
Miracles sometimes do occur in the midst of such
chaos, though — or, as with the National Security
Agency’s discovery of the “Kindred menace,” through
a literal mechanism of chaos. By tortuous paths, the
NSA, an information-monitoring arm of the US intelligence community, obtained devices that can distinguish vampires and ghouls from mortals. With astonishing alacrity and utter secrecy, the organization
deployed these “chaoscopic scanners” in locations
including Dulles International Airport, the Pentagon,

the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, the Capitol, and the White House, all behind the façades of
new metal detectors. Significantly, no one outside the
NSA is privy to the true nature of these added checkpoints, including the operators of the various metal
detectors. Not even the President is aware that he
and his staff are monitored daily by NSA operatives
looking for so-called “negative bodies,” a reference to
Cainites’ appearance when viewed through a chaoscope. Of the NSA’s own personnel, only three people
in decision-making positions know the truth: General
Rex Shivers, Colonel Alec Riley, and Colonel George
Johnstone. Add to them the actual monitoring staff,
and the total comes to two dozen… and one of them is
a rogue ghoul, acknowledging no master and using this
information for his own purposes.
The NSA’s discretion in this matter stems, in part,
from established procedure. Spymasters, canny in their
paranoia, trust no one, especially not their fellow agencies. Shivers’ people aren’t even sharing with their civilian counterparts at the NSA any information about
governmental encroachment by these mysterious negative-body entities. Plus, there’s the natural question of
just how influential these inhuman infiltrators may be:
Do they already control the FBI, the CIA, Congress, the
Department of Homeland Security, the President? Most
important, however, is the larger uncertainty implicit
in that question: The NSA knows its discoveries aren’t
quite human, but the organization’s members don’t yet
understand exactly what the negative bodies are.
Hobbling these covert watchers is the rationality
that spurred them to use the chaoscope, and that has
plagued them since the first time NSA brass saw one
of these machines demonstrated at the headquarters
of the Paranormal Research Wing, a Vermont-based
think tank. After General Shivers got a glimpse of
ghosts cavorting in the Underworld, he suggested that
PRW scientists had actually discovered some parallel
dimension rather than an afterlife existence. He then
ordered the PRW’s security clearances hiked and, on
a hunch, a streamlined version of the chaoscope to
be installed at the White House. Four months and a
billion dollars later, he was watching for things like
the ones he’d seen at PRW. What he saw ultimately
were ghouls and a vampire attending a state dinner,
but viewed chaoscopically these creatures were easy to
mistake for the disembodied dead Shivers had already
glimpsed. The conclusion he reached was entirely reasonable — that his transdimensional entities were possessing Washington officials to manipulate the govern-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

373

ment. Since then, that initial billion-dollar investment
has ballooned into a two-billion-dollar-a-year budget,
spent under the auspices of manpower, ongoing research, additional chaoscopy hardware, and R&D.
To some extent, the NSA’s military triumvirate is
“reinventing the wheel” with its expensive new toys.
A great deal of money could have been saved if anyone
had bothered to train infrared cameras on a few of those
room-temperature Cainites. Even without such tools,
Shivers’ predecessor, General Arthur Clifford, had a
far more accurate understanding of what the Kindred
are. Unfortunately, that knowledge was mutual, and
unknown Cainite elements were able to discredit Clifford and have him ousted. Thus, Shivers, Riley, and
Johnstone rose to the top at NSA because they were
skeptics regarding the supernatural — in contrast with
the deluded, utterly credulous figure Clifford was made
to seem at his downfall.
Nevertheless, Clifford’s replacements now know
a lot of the same things he knew — and then some
— but they’re interpreting the data quite differently.
They’re aware, for example, of their organization’s traitors, operatives Bruce Higgins and Felicity Price. More

374

importantly, the NSA has also identified the vampires
who control these two pawns. The agency is already
cataloging what it dubs “known extradimensionals”
and their “normal” contacts. As the extent of Kindred
influence in world commerce, media, and governance
becomes clear to General Shivers and his staff, the “war
of reconnaissance” the NSA is waging will seem ever
more of a luxury. When that time comes, the NSA operatives who’ve been training in armored moon suits
with aural inhibitors and mirrored faceplates will learn
firsthand what they’ve been prepared to fight. And the
Kindred will discover the folly of dismissing technology, just as the masters of that technology will discover
that the world is full of stranger things than science
and rationality can ever explain.
Of course, the other federal intelligence-gathering
and law-enforcement agencies (and even out-of-theloop civilian personnel within the NSA) are carrying
on largely as they did before the advent of the chaoscope, given the covert nature of the device. At the
DHS and the CIA, only scattered handfuls of agents
(some of them moles placed years ago by the NSA’s
General Clifford) have the vaguest clue about super-

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

natural activity. The FBI’s secret Special Affairs Department (also known as SAD), for example, lingers
on only because of the undying support of Senator Jesse
Grubbholb. After all, Arthur Clifford’s fall hasn’t made
it any easier to get any above-board federal money for
pursuing supernaturals. Similarly, this is what prevents
the Department of Homeland Security from devoting
significant attention to what its agents suspect are “domestic terrorists of paranormal radicalization.” Bringing up anything of the sort at a briefing is an excellent
way to find oneself laughed out of the department and
reassigned to duty watching an ideological wall separating the US from Mexico “in case any chupacabras
hop the fence,” so Homeland Security agents with an
interest in the Kindred have to make do with poaching
intelligence where they can.
More’s the pity, because the hunting in and around
the bureaucracy alone would be incredible. At the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, several strategically placed individuals, most of them under vampiric sway, keep the lid on incidents that involve “suspicious” (i.e., Cainite) blood or corpses. The lack of
blood-bound servitors here was a conscious effort by
various Kindred masters to avoid entanglements with
nosy epidemiologists, as vitae remains chemically distinct from mortal blood even in ghouls. However, that
dodge also insulates these conspirators from chaoscopic
detection. The devices are useless in identifying victims
of Dominate and Presence. Still, it wouldn’t take much
for a key piece of evidence to slip past these guardians
and allow the agency’s legitimate disease detectives to
glimpse the full picture.
At the state, county, and municipal levels of law
enforcement, things look much like they do at the
top: vast numbers of common cops, sheriffs, and state
troopers trying to do their jobs, most of them utterly
oblivious of the various factions that struggle nightly
to co-opt, deflect, or otherwise influence the police.
Ghoul cops exist, but they’re pretty much beneath the
NSA’s radar. And, as at the top, the myriad efforts to
preserve the Masquerade or uncover it, to detain this
one or arrest that one often end in a wash, and the cops
carry out their business as usual.

The Arcanum
This secret society’s members are among the foremost mortal pursuers of supernatural knowledge in
the World of Darkness. They are scholars, librarians,
and archaeologists; epopts, Hermetics, and herbalists;
Kabbalists, cryptographers, and students of the occult.
Since the Victorian era, the Arcanum’s academics and
explorers have ventured into the world’s oddest, most
remote corners to learn everything they can about the
unseen and the unknown.
Long ago, these mortals learned that the unseen and
the unknown sometimes have very sharp teeth and
most unsavory appetites. Arcanists also learned that
vampires do not like being the objects of investigation,
a fact harshly emphasized by Cainites’ torching of the
group’s Boston Chapter House in 1910. The resulting
loss of life and destruction of irreplaceable books (the
latter perhaps more than the former) left the Arcanum wary of delving into Kindred secrets. Nonetheless, vampires remained a focus for the group’s curiosity
— and for its collective guilt. Various members argued
over the years that turning a blind eye to the activities
of vampires was complicity in genocide.
Lately, unbeknownst to most of their fellows, several
Arcanists have taken action in this area. None of the organization’s members qualify as fools, however, and few
consider themselves warriors, so “action” in this context
means the judicious synthesis and redirection of information. Therefore, several strikes by the Inquisition
(which Arcanists also learned about long ago) against
Kindred lairs had their secret origins in the Arcanum’s
archives. Similarly, the Reverend Jebediah Brown, an
independent witch-hunter and former Arcanist, still believes his ongoing theft of intelligence from Arcanum
chapter houses goes unnoticed — but, in truth, he is but
another tool in an intricate armchair war.
Not even all of the Arcanum participants in these
redirection efforts are aware of one another’s work.
Because of the intense danger vampiric investigation
might pose to the entire organization, such activity is
grounds for dismissal. Thus, Arcanists engage in “sic-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

375

cing the witch-hunters” singly or in groups of two or
three at most, and always with extreme care to preserve
their anonymity. No member risks more with these
clandestine pursuits than Sandeep D’Souza, Chancellor of the New Delhi Chapter House, who is poised
to assume the Arcanum’s Grand Chancellorship. Yet,
since finding himself amidst rioting Sabbat vampires in
Frankfurt and witnessing their depredations up close,
D’Souza is a changed man. He doesn’t understand why
he was spared, which further fanned his guilt and ultimately propelled the Arcanist onto his current course.
D’Souza is uncomfortable with using people as pawns
against the Kindred, but he now finds inaction to be
unthinkable.
Most of the organization’s seekers of mysteries continue to encounter vampires unexpectedly, as mortals
always have. It was through analyzing accounts by Arcanists who were looking for other things entirely (including the Grail) that D’Souza and his ilk have been
able to pinpoint many Kindred havens. Of course,
some of their suppositions are based on where missing
colleagues are thought to have vanished. With much

376

of the world in a state of religious agitation, the Arcanum has found Kindred in greater numbers and of
more varied ideologies than they had guessed existed.
This fact makes the Chancellor’s abstinence ever more
difficult to maintain — though he has gone so far as
to “suggest” that discreet Arcanum fellows of immediate means test their own boundaries. D’Souza wishes to
gauge their success in these clandestine endeavors, and
has no idea how close his own secret machinations are
to those of the feared and hated vampires he observes.

Criminals
Kindred long ago cemented their influence over parts
of La Cosa Nostra, the Russian Mafiya, and the Cali
and Medellín drug cartels, as well as assorted ethnic,
biker, and street gangs. Vampires use such criminals as
cannon fodder, obstacles for the authorities, scapegoats
when the Jyhad’s skirmishes draw the attention of any
media not under vampiric sway, and even as sustenance
that goes largely unmissed should a Cainite get greedy
while feeding. Given the superstition and ignorance
common amongst criminals, there’s some advantage
to be gained from rumors that the “Big Boss” can see
through walls or laugh off a gunshot. Most vampires
choose to exert their will from total secrecy, however,
and so most crooks have no idea of the Kindred’s existence or agenda.
Recently, someone has been altering this equation.
Some carefully-chosen midlevel thugs, including several Mafia lieutenants, Organizatsiya chiefs, a Cali Cartel
street boss and others with a range of affiliations, have
been hearing lectures on Cainite history, morphology,
and power structures. The informants in question are
knowledgeable and calculating. They share kernels of
wisdom that are likely to incite an individual boss or
gang against a specific vampire or Kindred in general.
By playing on mortal fears and ambitions, these mysterious visitors have already ignited what promises to
be a gang war of epic — if not apocalyptic — proportions.
In several areas of Detroit, for example, street violence is at an all-time high. After a man presented
himself to the members of the local Columbian drug
posse, demonstrated supernatural powers, claimed to
be a messenger from God, and tricked the crew’s Cainite leader into revealing his true nature, things got ugly
fast. Intergang conflict quickly followed as mafioski,
armed with stakes and AK-47s, joined the party. Local
Giovanni vampires reacted harshly after some of their
normally civil Colombian colleagues raided a Clan haven and chainsawed apart a few ghouls. Similar strife
plagues Miami, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
Most of the affected Kindred reacted swiftly enough
to avoid harm in the first wave of violence. Quelling the
gang warfare has thus far defied both individual efforts
and concerted ones. The ongoing violence and pervasive Sabbat presence have hampered investigations by
Camarilla Justicars in the targeted cities, but neither

factor has prevented widespread realization among the
Kindred that these events were a patently orchestrated
assault. One consistent detail about the informants has
surfaced: While they vary by race, gender, and description in the reports assembled thus far, all consistently
identified themselves as “Caitiff.”
Of course, this tidbit met with both consternation
and skepticism among Cainites. It seemed too transparent an attempt at further dividing their ranks, and
rather a stupid, pointless ploy for these dispossessed
vampires to attempt anyway. Nevertheless, whoever
committed this act of war (in every sense) clearly knew
Kindred culture. The culprits — or perhaps culprit, as
some vampires suspect a lone metamorph of some sort
— surely must be supernatural, as many of the informants claimed to be angels helping to redeem gangsters’
“immortal souls” and displayed unearthly abilities. Unfortunately for the Cainites, many of the criminals so
approached were susceptible to such arguments.
Immediate consequences of this enemy action include the reduced usefulness of organized criminals for
the Kindred and the unsavory possibility that key pawns
may have to be purged from a variety of gangs. The longrange alternative is less pleasant, as some Kindred worry
that bounties for vampires could become popular among
crooks very quickly indeed. The mood on the streets of
the major metropolitan centers is decidedly uneasy, and
only the most powerful (or foolhardy) Cainites now
supervise criminal organizations directly. Whether the
situation could worsen still — especially given the anonymity of the perpetrator — remains to be seen.

Werewolves
The cities belong to the Kindred, and the race of
Caine adopts their gilded cage as a badge of pride. The
truth of the situation is a bit more complex, however.
The interstices between cities and the swaths of untenanted wilderness that surround communities belong to
the creatures calling themselves the Lupines. These are
the wolf-men, the werewolves, and in the territories
outside the cities, their wrathful will is law.
Vampires speak fearfully of the Lupines’ capacities
for violence. Even the most hardened Brujah and the
deadliest Assamite give the werewolves a wide berth,
for the shapeshifters consider themselves a warrior race
and their rage lies close to the surface. Indeed, the Kindred and the Lupines have been at war since time out of
mind, and to the shapeshifters, it is every bit a holy war.
Even what fleeting commonalities certain Kindred may
share with the werewolves — affinity with animals, a
Beast that guides their movements, the ability to take
on other forms — is no help. When vampires and Lupines meet, bloodshed is almost certain to follow.
Even elders wisely fear the viciousness of the wolfmen, as much for their near-indestructibility as their
ability to inflict carnage. Savvy Kindred say the greatest
threat posed by a werewolf isn’t just his potential to invoke violence, but to withstand it as well. One werewolf
is a match for a whole coterie of young Kindred, and
certain revered Lupines may well be able to stand toeto-toe with a coterie of elder vampires. The werewolf
reputation for formidability is so great that cocky packs
of Sabbat sometimes take on the challenge of hunting
these creatures down and proving their own superiority.
It’s a boast upon which few Cainites can deliver.
Whispers among well-traveled vampires imply that
the wolf-men aren’t the only creatures who can take
on the skins of savage beasts. Those who can take the
form of ravens, sharks, great cats, or even spiders circulate among the realm of night. Whether there is any
truth to these tales has yet to be undeniably confirmed,
but in the modern nights, it’s only a matter of time.

Powers and Weaknesses
• Lupines can take the forms of humans and wolves,
as well as some forms that combine the traits of both.
Most terrifying of all is their “wolfman” battle form, a
wolf-headed, nine-foot humanoid killing machine that
inspires a supernatural terror in humans. In this form,
all their Physical Attributes are doubled, but they can-

378

not use Social Attributes in connection with creatures
other than werewolves and wild beasts (save to intimidate or terrify, of course).
• Werewolves create an effect known as the Delirium that is similar to a “forced Masquerade.” When
non-supernatural creatures observe a Lupine in battle
form or using a mystical power, they are very likely to
flee, and then later to rationalize the event in their
minds, no matter how far they have to reach to justify
it. This can occasionally help a Kindred protect her
own breaches of the Masquerade, though a Kindred in
close proximity to a werewolf probably has other, more
immediate concerns at hand.
• Werewolves can attack several times each turn, often taking two to six actions in a single turn (like those
actions provided by Celerity). They also fly into frenzy
as readily as any Brujah, and in this killing state they
suffer no health level penalties for wounds.
• Lupines heal incredibly rapidly, regenerating a
health level each turn. Only fire, silver, or the teeth
and claws of other supernatural creatures (such as a
vampire’s fangs) can cause lasting injuries to a werewolf — and a werewolf can even heal these wounds
as a normal human can. Worse, werewolves can soak
such damage with ease. Consider all damage — bashing, lethal, and aggravated — to be soakable with the
werewolf’s normal Stamina. However, because they are
living beings, werewolves do not halve bashing damage
applied to them, as the undead do.
• Werewolves fuel their supernatural powers with
Gnosis, a measure of their innate spiritual energy.
Werewolves can store a quantity of Gnosis in a reserve
of sorts, like vampires’ blood points. When they use
equivalent Disciplines that call for blood points, use
Gnosis instead. They regain Gnosis through long meditation or from bargaining with spirits.
• Lupines are apparently able to travel invisibly
through the “spirit world,” sometimes appearing from
nowhere to attack their foes.
• Wolfsbane avails nothing against the Lupines,
though silver is indeed their downfall. Werewolves
cannot soak damage from silver weapons, and cannot
regenerate such wounds as quickly as those from normal weapons.
• Lupines can call on strange mystical powers, not
entirely dissimilar to vampiric Disciplines. Given time,
they can also work certain rituals in the manner of
Thaumaturgy. These powers depend on the werewolf’s
area of specialization, and can be represented by Disci-

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

plines — presume that a scout has something akin to
Obfuscate, a shaman can ape Thaumaturgy or Necromancy, and so on.
• Werewolves do not have the same morality as vampires, but a Humanity score is provided as a rough metric and for mechanical effects that require such a score.

Magi
Dangerous Draughts
Lupine blood is potent vitae, and a powerful
allure to the Kindred. A werewolf’s blood is
so rich that, though its body holds the equivalent physical volume of 10 blood points, a
vampire can draw 20 or more actual blood
points from the Lupine before its veins run
dry. Even if a Cainite has time to guzzle only
a blood point’s worth, he gains two points for
his pool. However, the supernatural power of
werewolf blood can also be dangerous.
A vampire who feasts on werewolf blood is
far more susceptible to frenzy and Rötschreck
while the Lupine blood remains in her system.
Every blood point of werewolf blood increases
the difficulty to resist frenzy by one — that
is, if a character drinks only two blood points
worth of vitae from a Lupine, her difficulties
to resist frenzy are two higher (even though
the points manifest as four total blood points
in the vampire’s system). Even if the vampire
successfully staves off her Beast, she becomes
paranoid and short-tempered for as long as
the blood remains in her system. In some
cases, vampires have even gained temporary
derangements from feasting on particularly
volatile werebeasts.
There are rumors that Lupine blood can
even temporarily grant levels of Potence or
Celerity. However, this isn’t always the case.
It seems to have something to do with the
werewolf’s own bloodline, and how pure its
heritage is. Unfortunately for would-be hunters, the more purely bred Lupines are often in
positions of leadership in their packs, and it is
a deadly proposition to go through the rankand-file to catch the alpha.

There is nothing more terrifying than things we
don’t understand, and vampires of any age simply cannot understand the magi. Even ancient Kindred who
once claimed brotherhood to the mages are puzzled by
them. Enlightened by mad wisdom, magi can pick at
the underpinnings of creation and move them to their
liking — and that kind of power terrifies the Kindred.
Where sorcery (or “magick,” as the wizards insist on
spelling it) originally came from is a secret lost in time.
Some claim that Lilith herself learned the magick Arts,
and that she passed them on to those mortals that she
favored. If that’s true, then the magi are related to the
Kindred through the same lineage, and it’s possible
that the ancient feud between the followers of Caine
and the followers of Lilith may have been passed on to
the vampires and the mages.
Regardless of its origins, however, magick is a real
force, and it comes in many varieties. A powerful wizard can perform amazing feats worthy of a fantasy film,
but most prefer subtler effects. Strange coincidences
are the tools of the modern mage, not a fireball or a
rampaging demon. Since mages are mortal, they often
hide in plain sight, conducting their business daily until they are ready to take on the Kindred. A mage is no
match for a vampire in a straight-up fight, however,
so wizards often lay traps and scheme, much like the
vampires themselves. Conflicts between vampires and
mages more often resemble chess matches than cage
matches, but when necessary, the mage still has the
power to turn a Cainite to stone or burn him with the
power of the sun.
Kindred have tried for centuries to learn the secrets
of the magi, but to no avail. Blood bonds, Embraces,
mystical pacts, and even ripping apart their minds have
produced only wisps of true magick. It seems that life
itself is somehow tied to these Arts, and that is the one
thing that vampires can never truly have.
The conflicts, abilities, and politics of the magi have
divided them into several distinct, often conflicting
factions:

Wizards, Witches,
and Miracle-workers
When the typical vampire thinks of mages, they usually think of those mortals that practice the arts of sorcery and witchcraft, people draped in New Age clothes

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

and surrounded by ritual trappings. Many neonates assume that such magicians are frauds, until a withering
curse or a coincidental lighting strike shows them the
error of their ways.
The Warlocks of Clan Tremere often reference their
long historical association with hermetic mages. One
such group, the Order of Hermes, has a complex love/
hate relationship with the Tremere that goes back
nearly a thousand years, to the foundation of the Clan
itself. Centuries of wars, truces, and alliances later,
the two groups have decided to just avoid each other
whenever possible. Naturally, this means that they secretly spy on each other and lie in wait for the other
side to make a mistake.
Other magician-cults are more hidden and far less
predictable. For example, one faction keeps to the pagan ways of their ancestors, practicing a form of blood
magick that allows them to act as shapeshifting warriors
and peaceful healers in equal measure. While many elders have at least heard of these gory rituals, few have
attended personally, and even fewer have managed to
successfully convert one into a pawn.

Shamans and Yogi
These mages are enigmas, honing their minds and
bodies in strange and powerful ways. Some commune
quietly with spirits, while others practice mystical martial arts, and still others barter with ghosts and dead
gods using primitive rituals.
In general, such wizards tend to be secretive. They
affect the dress and language of lost tribes, or mix and
match to integrate more seamlessly into “modern primitive” subculture. Unlike the mages of other factions,
these 21st-century shamans avoid flashy magick, focusing instead on manipulating emotions, thoughts, or
elements. In general, they want to exist outside of the
Jyhad, only bringing their mighty power to bear when
forced to deal with the Kindred. Aside from some Gangrel and the occasional Setite, vampires are happy to
leave them the hell alone.

Techno-Freaks
Intriguing to some neonates but incomprehensibly
terrifying to most elders, these magi blend technology,
magick, and humanity in bizarre ways. Some build intensely powerful computer viruses, infecting huge databases and taking critical services offline, while others
lurk on the Internet, searching for secret information to
use in their ongoing conflicts. Strangest of all are those

that actually graft mechanical parts into their own
bodies, acquiring Discipline-like powers — inhuman
strength, amazing sensory perception, and even hidden
weaponry. Some of these are so deeply entwined with
their machinery that their blood has become toxic to
vampires, barely resembling mortal vitae at all.
These mystical factions are as likely to attack each
other as the Kindred, locked in a shadowy struggle
that the vampires can barely comprehend. Elders
speak of wizard-wars that destroyed towns back in the
Dark Ages, and there is little to suggest that they have
stopped in the modern nights. Whatever the truth, the
magi are a mysterious group, and any vampire that values immortality would do well to avoid these powerful
mortals as much as possible.

Powers and Weaknesses
Magickal powers are diverse. To simulate a magician’s repertoire, the Storyteller may assign a group
of Disciplines as his “arsenal.” Common Disciplines
include Thaumaturgy, Auspex, Dominate, Presence,
Protean, Obfuscate, and Obtenebration. Uncommon
powers include Animalism, Celerity, Fortitude, Potence, Necromancy, and Chimerstry. A young magician would command five or so dots, an experienced
one 10 or more, and a powerful wizard might have
more than 20.
A few other things are worth remembering:
• Magi are mortal. While they can attempt to soak
bashing attacks, they cannot soak lethal or aggravated
damage without conjuring some sort of armor or utilizing cybernetic protection. Magi do not heal damage
without the passage of time unless some medicinal spell
is employed (curing one health level per success).
• While a rare few possess a Celerity-like power,
most magicians act only once per turn.
• Wizards are not immune to the blood bond, and
the Embrace destroys their power forever.
• Magick demands will; hence, magicians often have
Willpower ratings between 6 and 10.
• Mages have access to energy called Quintessence,
which they can replenish through exposure to mystical
areas or access to magic items that store such energy.
When using equivalent Disciplines, they spend Quintessence points instead of blood points, similar to werewolves and Gnosis (p. 378).
• Although the magi do not depend on age for their
Arts, powerful ones may have effective Generation Back-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

381

grounds to reflect their arcane prowess. The more powerful the magus, the higher her effective “Generation.”
• An odd syndrome known as Paradox attacks
magi whose spells are too blatant. A naturally rolled
“1” on an exceedingly obvious spell (flight, a fireball,
shapechanging, a chain-gun rising from the mage’s
back, etc.) causes things to go horribly wrong. Paradoxed wizards find their spells backfiring or their bodies collapsing. Some are swept off to Hell by demonic
forces. Thus, magi are wary about using magick openly,
even around the Kindred.
• A vampire with Thaumaturgy or Thaumaturgical
Countermagic can try to counter a magickal spell directed at her; a Wits + Occult roll (difficulty 6) “soaks”
such spells, reducing the attack’s potency by one level
(or die) per success. A vampire who eliminates a mage’s successes neutralizes the wizard’s spell. A magi can
also turn this ability around on vampires as well, using
their countermagic against Kindred Disciplines.
• Mages do not have the same morality as vampires,
but a Humanity score is provided as a rough metric and
for mechanical effects that require such a score.

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

Faeries
The fae are strange, enigmatic beings that live among
both mortals and supernaturals without leaving any
evidence of their existence. Modern faeries are very
different from the sprites and tree-lords of legend. Instead, they hide their magic in human form, although
why they walk in the World of Darkness is unknown.
Elders remember the faeries of old, and such Kindred
claim that the fae have changed little in nature. They
are still wild, alien, and capricious — and best avoided
altogether. Few vampires who have dealings with the
fae come out ahead, and even those that do are often
left changed or driven mad by the experience. Even
the very presence of the fae can cause Kindred to suffer
crippling feelings of loss and agony as their physical
beauty awakens long-dead feelings. A desperate craving for lost innocence or a yearning to believe in miracles can drive Cainites to despair.
Much of the time faeries are masked as mortals, their
true selves hidden away. Only those who know what
to look for can pierce the illusion that conceals them,
and even then it is neither easy nor safe to do so. The
fae like privacy and do not react well to those seeking to unmask them. They prefer to show their true
natures only when they choose, and not before. The
fae take many forms. Some are regal and exquisitely
beautiful, while others are hideous and gruesome. After they make their presence known, the encounter is
often forgotten, as though it were a fading dream.
Some Kindred (such as the Malkavians, the Ravnos,
and the Tremere) hunt faeries for their blood, believing it to be far more potent than mortal blood. Among
those who claim to have tasted this sweet vitae, the
experience is quite varied. Some claim that fae blood
tastes little or no different from mortal blood; others
speak of rapturous bliss, hallucinations, or transcendent
experiences. Some compare it to feeling the morning
sun shining upon one’s face once more — both in its
exhilaration and in its excruciating pain.
Little is known of the customs or society of the fae.
It does seem that fae activity increases greatly during
certain times of the year, such as the equinoxes and
solstices, as well as during festivals like Mardi Gras.
Vampires may encounter faeries at any time, however,
even if they aren’t aware of it.
Even less is understood about their magic. Those faeries inclined to speak (and speak truthfully) on the
matter claim their powers are fueled from a source they

call Glamour, though how this Glamour is used and
restored remains a mystery. Certain members of Clan
Toreador believe that faeries gain their power through
a connection to mortal art and artists, and more than
one Toreador has come into conflict with the fae over
a particularly talented artist or musician.
Faeries encountered in a Vampire story should remain distant and mysterious. Even if a vampire somehow befriends one of these beings, the alienation
should be constantly reinforced. Additionally, the fact
that the fae are so vibrant and full of life will serve as
a constant reminder of what the vampire has lost by
joining the legions of the undead — a situation that
could quickly prove intolerable.

Powers and Weaknesses
• Faeries heal as mortals, though many know healing
magic. They may soak lethal damage, but do not halve
bashing damage. They take aggravated damage only
from fire. If attacked with a weapon made of “cold”
(unforged) iron, the faerie cannot soak the damage.
• They find the presence of vampires distasteful, and
tend to avoid the undead. They may conceal their faerie forms from a vampire’s sight, but Auspex often allows a vampire to pierce the disguise.
• Faeries spend Glamour to power equivalent Disciplines in the same way that werewolves do with Gnosis
(p. 378).
• The fae do not have the same morality as vampires,
but a Humanity score is provided as a rough metric and
for mechanical effects that require such a score.

Pooka Trickster
This trickster often resembles an animal, at least
when she reveals her faerie self. Kindred scholars of
fae lore believe that pooka can shift into the form of
the animal that they represent, in a manner similar to
the Lupines, though this has never been observed. The
pooka take delight in teasing and tormenting others.

Ghosts
The restless dead, lingering spirits of departed mortals, have been around as long as Cainites have, perhaps longer. Many call themselves wraiths, and they
are bound to the living world by some Passion, some
unfinished business in the realm of the living. Not every dead mortal manifests as a ghost, but all who do so
retain links to people, places, or things from their mortal lives. Such physical anchors can sway the emotiondriven existences of wraiths, who sustain themselves
with strong emotions much as Kindred do with blood.
Wraiths, though normally incorporeal, can appear
among the living in a variety of guises and through a range
of powers similar to vampiric Disciplines. The invisibly
hurled plate, the sourceless whisper, the worm-riddled
visage that flickers at the edge of perception — these are

384

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

all possible for ghosts, and vampires aren’t immune to
such tricks. Haunted vampires are doubly damned, and
such unfortunates typically find themselves shunned by
Kindred society. But ghosts can’t howl and rattle their
way around the Skinlands — the living world, our world
— with impunity. Impeding them is the Shroud, a spiritual wall that separates the living from the dead.
Most Cainites, save necromancers like those the Giovanni Clan, manage to elude any entanglement with
ghosts. A dead person with a grudge against a vampire
can be an annoyance or a threat, and most vampires are
intolerant of either option. Only those with a grasp of
Necromancy have any recourse against the restless dead.

Powers and Weaknesses
• Wraiths “feed” on emotion; this recharges their Passion pool, which is used to power their magical abilities
(much like blood points). Kindred in frenzy may actually find themselves strengthening a ghostly opponent.
• Wraiths manifest most effectively in “haunted”
sites and places where great suffering or trauma has left
a psychic residue (battlefields, torture chambers, “suicide bridge,” etc.). In such places, the Shroud between
the worlds of the living and the dead is weak.

Recently Deceased
This newly made wraith is most likely quite cocky
and still has significant ties with the mortal world.
However, he is inexperienced about the ways of the
Underworld and the supernatural, often leading to a
few rude surprises.

Spectre
Death and time have not improved this wraith. Perhaps he died with such rage and hate in his heart that

• Cainites’ physicality and wraiths’ incorporeality
make conventional fights between them out of the
question. Vampires can influence one of the Restless by
manipulating her fetters (objects or persons important
to the ghost in life), or they can affect a wraith directly
with Necromancy or other Disciplines. Conversely,
wraiths can possess mortals in order to attack a Cainite, or they can invisibly propel inanimate objects.
• Wraiths are normally invisible unless they choose
to be seen. Vampires can perceive them through the
use of Necromancy, however, and sometimes with
Auspex.
• Some necromancers have encountered ghosts of
true malice and hatred, who set about making their
would-be masters’ lives an absolute misery. These dark
spirits seem to “live” only for inflicting pain, and indeed seem to thrive on it. Other ghosts seem to fear
them, and refer to them as Spectres.
• Wraiths can affect the lands of the living, albeit
with great effort. In the Shadowlands, however, they
can easily inflict damage to the foolish who invade
their home turf. (Stats to the right of the “/” in the stat
blocks below reflect the wraith’s power in the Shadowlands.)

his dark side consumed him utterly upon death, or
perhaps his bitterness slowly drove him into darkness.

three more will answer his summons.

Demons
The Kindred believe themselves the masters of history. They have ruled mankind from the shadows and
shaped its beliefs for time immemorial. Yet there are
creatures older than the Kindred, creatures which
claim to predate all of humanity. These creatures have
their own place in mortal belief, and their own agendas in the cities which vampires rule. These creatures
possess the bodies of the weak and depraved, or haunt
ancient relics and places.

386

Few vampires consider the existence of demons; after
all, are not the Kindred themselves fallen and Damned?
Why go looking for creatures more wretched? To most
vampires, demons are creatures of myth, figments of
the mortal imagination and perhaps the dreams of deluded Kindred cultists. Even those who believe typically adhere to mortal legend. Vampires who have encountered demons, however, know that they are as
real as the claws of the Lupines. They have seen things
which should not be, which neither man nor vampire
was meant to know.
Of course, some vampires worship demons... and some
even hunt them. The Baali believe that demons are the
children of night itself, cast out of the sky by a narcissist
God who created humanity to satisfy His vanity. They
say that these spirits slumber in the earth, beneath the
ruins of the first cities. They believe that the demons’
names grant them power, but that knowing them grants
the demons power over them. They claim that demons
were the true power behind the most ancient of mortals’ false gods. The most powerful among them can
bring demons forth into the material world.
Some of the demons themselves claim that they were
not always creatures of darkness. Indeed, many owe allegiance to a creature called the Lightbringer. The demons say that they were the servants of God before
mortals were created, and that they fell only because
they loved humanity too much. They say that they witnessed Caine slay Abel, and saw the tide of blood unleashed by the first murder. So demons say... but they
are also notorious liars.
The Fallen, those demons who are ensconced in mortal flesh, operate much as vampires do. They scheme
against each other for sway over mortals, whose prayers
they devour. They even organize themselves into feudal hierarchies which span cities and regions. They
grant power to their cultists, who carry forth their blasphemous word. They may not wield the influence that
vampires do over human institutions, but they certainly covet it.
The Earthbound, demons who haunt objects or places, are of a different order. They also scheme, but their
ancient minds are maddened, and their plans emerge
from fevered dreams. They claim that they were once
mankind’s gods, just as the Baali say. Their cults are
thusly more ancient, spanning innumerable generations. They demand sacrifice and depravity of their
followers. The Earthbound are the most powerful of
demons, but are trapped in their haunts or reliquaries.

CHAPTER NINE: THE OTHERS

Powers and Weaknesses
• All demons practice some form of possession; without a host, they are torn screaming back into whatever
hell they came from. The Fallen are lesser demons, whose
essence can be contained in a mortal shell. They possess
humans whose souls are loosely bound to their bodies,
such as the young, the infirm, or those utterly steeped in
sin. The Earthbound are usually more potent, and possess
ancient artifacts or unholy places. If these greater demons
attempt to possess a mortal host, they swiftly destroy it
from the inside out. A few demons have been able to possess vampires, but rarely for long; their ends in such bodies are usually disastrous for the original owners.
• Demons can take on apocalyptic forms that show
their true nature, and which manifest monstrous traits
like wings, horns, and claws. Some do this by transforming their hosts, while others are able to temporarily
project themselves outside their bodies or reliquaries.
Powers like Aura Perception can reveal this form to curious Kindred.
• Demons are immune to all forms of mind control.
However, when summoned, they can be bound by the
terms of bargains with humans or vampires.
• Many demonic powers parallel those of vampires,
such as the ability to bind mortals to their will, reshape
human flesh, or summon infernal fire. The Fallen typically exhibit powers equivalent to Disciplines in the
one to five dot range, while the Earthbound command
powers of six dots or greater.

• Like vampires, demons take their power from mortals. Where the Kindred feed on blood, these creatures
feed on the faith of their followers. A mortal cultist
or thrall must willingly offer her devotion, though the
demon may lie in order to obtain it. Those mortals who
make pacts with demons provide them with a steady
flow of this energy, which they can then use to fuel
their powers (use “Faith” in place of blood for equivalent Disciplines).
• Some cultists are imbued with the power of demons, and may manifest the spirits’ dark miracles without being directly possessed.
• Demons are constantly tormented by dark memories and a spiritual pull back to their infernal prison.
Additionally, the Fallen are often confused by the
memories of their hosts. This torment can result in erratic behavior, spoiling otherwise dangerous plans.

Bestiary

Note: Alligators and crocodiles have one soak die of
armor, usable against bashing or lethal damage.

Vampires are creatures of the cities and rarely interact
with the beasts of the wild. Indeed, most animals fear
the Kindred, hissing or snarling as the unnatural creatures approach. Nonetheless, certain vampires (particularly those with the Animalism Discipline) employ
animals as companions, spies, or soldiers. Further, animals are occasionally changed into ghouls, particularly
by the vampires of Clans Gangrel and Nosferatu.

Bat

Normal animals are described with only Physical
and Mental Traits. They also have Abilities, reflecting innate or trained abilities. Traits in square brackets
are instilled through human contact and training; an
animal in the wilderness does not have these Abilities.
Trained animals can also gain Willpower. Animals
whose health levels include Incapacitated can survive
longer than those without it — others die when they
run out of health levels. The blood pool Trait reflects
how many points a feeding Cainite can drain from a
beast. (Note that animal blood is far less satisfying than
human vitae; some animals that have more blood than
a human actually have lower blood pool ratings.) Damage inflicted by animals is lethal, although small creatures might inflict bashing damage at the Storyteller’s
discretion.
Any of the beasts below can be turned into ghoul
retainers with a monthly dose of at least one point of
vampire blood; such companions gain Willpower, a
dot of Potence, a useable blood pool of 2, and trained
Abilities (more information on ghouls is on p. 496).
Dogs are frequently made into ghouls because of their
loyalty and intelligence. Dogs also rarely attract attention, and can be easily trained. Cats have been linked
to creatures of the night, and more than one vampire
has kept a feline companion through the transition
from mortal to immortal. Still, these are not the limits
of ghoul pets. Most domestic (and many wild) animals
have been turned into ghouls at one point or another.

Packs and Swarms
Although the Traits listed above detail individual
creatures, some animals attack en masse. If a swarm of
hornets or horde of rats accosts the characters, instead
of trying to determine what each and every member of
a pack or swarm does, simply roll to see if the swarm itself harms a character. Narrate the results from there.
Each beast type is given a listing on the chart below.
Roll the damage dice pool listed once per turn (difficulty 6), and allow the characters to try to dodge or

soak the result. This damage is lethal, or possibly bashing in the case of small or weak creatures. Packs attack
once per turn per target, and act on the initiative given
on the chart.
If a character dodges, he can move normally for the
remainder of the turn. Otherwise, his attackers slow
him down to half his usual movement. If they score
more than three health levels’ worth of damage in one
turn (after the target soaks), or if the player botches
an appropriate roll, the character is knocked down and
overrun. He can only move 1-2 yards/meters per turn,
and the swarm’s damage difficulty falls to 5. Efforts to
get back up and continue moving (see “Knockdown,”
p. 279) are typically at +1 or +2 difficulty.
The health levels listed reflect the amount of damage
it takes to disperse a pack or swarm. An additional two
health levels destroy the attackers completely. Pistols,
rifles, and small melee weapons (knives, brass knuckles, bottles, claws, bare hands) inflict a single health
level per strike, no matter how many attack or damage
successes are rolled (that is, the strike hits only one
creature). Shotguns, submachine guns, and large melee
weapons (swords, staves, boards, chainsaws) do normal
damage (each damage success rolled eliminates one
health level of the swarm as a whole), as do large-area
attacks (Molotov cocktails, frost storms, gusts of wind,
explosions). Swarms and packs don’t soak.
Depending on the size of the pack, two or more characters might be affected by it and can attack it in return. Anyone who helps an overrun character can be
attacked as well. A human can outrun some packs or
swarms (those consisting of rats or bugs), but can’t hope
to outrun others (those consisting of hyenas or birds).

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Chapter Ten:
Bloodlines
"I learned from them to take the blackness from the blood,
the wounds from the flesh, the evil from the world.
And though I may die, you, my childer will live on."
- The Book of Nod
In the years since Vampire was first published, the
seven Clans grew into 13, with an impressive number
of former Clans, sub-Clans, and bloodlines to boot. This
chapter includes write-ups of many of these bloodlines,
so that old fans can enjoy playing with them again, and
new players can get a glimpse of how diverse Vampire
really is.

bonds of the circle and achieved autonomy, then do
it (with Storyteller approval). Just be aware that doing so makes a statement about the World of Darkness
that playing a Toreador painter does not — and maybe
that’s not a bad thing.

Playing Bloodlines

While modern neonates have little understanding of
how their elders survived in past centuries, some vampires still active tonight remember the Cappadocians,
the Lamia, and other such bloodlines. As such, it’s appropriate to note that the Camarilla and the Sabbat
were both created after the fall of some of the Clans.

The bloodlines described in this chapter are rare, or in
some cases, entirely extinct in the modern nights. Does
that mean that such characters are not viable for players to portray? Not in the least. Playing the last surviving
member of, say, the Telyavic Tremere is an opportunity for
great drama. It just requires that the player and the Storyteller be ready for the kinds of situations that creates.
It could be argued, then, that a player who creates
such a character is just trying to be “more unique” than
other vampires. Possibly, but so what? If the goal is to
tell a compelling story, to focus on the characters that
are, by default, more interesting than any others (that
is, your characters), then why not create something
that doesn’t exist anywhere else? If you feel compelled
to play a Blood Brother that has somehow broken the

History and Vampires

Up until the middle of the 15th century or so, vampire
society broke the Clans down into two groups: High Clans
and Low Clans. The High Clans were the Brujah, Cappadocians, Lasombra, Toreador, Tzimisce, and Ventrue. The
Low Clans were the Assamites, Followers of Set, Gangrel,
Malkavians, Nosferatu, Ravnos, and Tremere (still considered usurpers for what they did to the Salubri). The bloodlines that did not survive beyond (or much beyond) the
Dark Ages — the Anda, Cappadocians, Lamia, Lhiannan,
and Noaid — have stereotypes and quotes drawn from
these groups, rather than the Camarilla and Sabbat.

Baali
Even monsters have their bogeymen, and Kindred
are no exception. Sires often attempt to keep neonates
from growing drunk on their own power as vampires,
and one method for doing so is to explain to them what
sorts of twisted, evil power awaits them in the dark.
The Baali are one such power.

History — or legend, perhaps — claims that the childe of an Antediluvian made a pact with forces beyond
human understanding in order to make war on the
thirteen Clans. He took the name Baal-the-Destroyer,
and he led his apostles against the Second City. The
battle was terrible, and none caught in its wake were
spared — Demon and Kindred alike perished. But the
Baali and their unholy allies were routed and fled, and
over the millennia, they faded from memory, to legend, to cautionary tale.
The Baali do still exist, though. The Inquisition
weeded out the stupid and the careless, but left the
clever and the patient. Some went into torpor, while
others simply claimed membership in another Clan
and begged for sanctuary. Now, in modern nights, the
bloodline sees more concentrated activity than it has
for centuries. Baali are explorers and seekers of secrets.
They will do almost anything and sacrifice almost anyone to gain access to occult mysteries. They squander
the wealth they have accumulated, they make deals
they cannot possible hope to live up to, and they
do so with no apology and no attempt at excuse.
They seem to know that they are in decline, and
that their bloodline is disappearing into the mists
of time.
The bloodline has enemies, after all. Infernalists — those who call up and worship demons —
are one of the very few beings that can be called
“common enemies” by most of the denizens of the
World of Darkness, Kindred and otherwise.
Despite their small numbers and host of enemies, the Baali are dangerous. They are not
Faustian bargainers, looking for comfort or even
knowledge. They do not wish to reign in Hell.
They believe — they know — that the world is
doomed. The End Times are here, and every sacrifice they make, every murder they incite, is one
more chink in the dam holding back the deluge of
blood called Gehenna. If they have to die to break
that dam, so be it. They die knowing that what they
do is what must be done.
Nickname: Demons
Sect: While individual Baali might pretend to
membership in the Camarilla or, less commonly, the
Sabbat, the bloodline as a whole claims no Sect.

394

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Appearance: Some neonates adorn themselves with
Satanic paraphernalia. Some Baali dress in expensive
clothing, and some don’t bother. Some become so fixated that they neglect outer appearance. Older Baali
surround themselves with insects, rats, or other vermin.
Haven: Baali tend to nest in places of antiquity. Libraries, universities, and stately homes attract the Demons. No matter where the Baali make their havens,
though, the vampire’s very presence changes the place.
Vermin creep in first, and no amount of effort can keep
them out.
Background: The Baali value temperament above
profession. Teachers, defrocked priests, laborers, artists
— all have joined the ranks of the Baali. The bloodline
even breeds their own recruits, drawing from ghoul families raised over the years to produce offspring suckled
on the unholy truths that the Baali recite as gospel.
Character Creation: Mental Attributes, especially
Perception, are usually primary. A Baali’s ability to
tempt and entice depend on his insight into what a
person truly wants. Social Attributes are also helpful,
as the Baali need both to keep their identities a secret
and convince others to open up to them.
Clan Disciplines: Daimoinon, Obfuscate, Presence
Weakness: Baali cannot bear to look upon or handle objects of any faith. Demons must avert their gazes
from such objects, and touching them burns their flesh.
In addition, should a Baali run afoul of True Faith, any
hindering or damage effects are doubled.

Organization: The Baali gather in cabals numbering three to 13. Supposedly, these cabals answer to the
bloodline’s founder. Any Demon is willing to die to
protect his cabal-mates; not out of any loyalty or affection for them, but because they’re all doomed anyway.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: Sooner or later, the masks have to
come off. Take all the time you need. We’ll wait.
Sabbat: A honeycomb in which to hide. Just
learn how the little bees dance first.
Followers of Set: They have the right idea.
They’re just playing for the wrong team.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Satanists? They’re not… wait. You
think they care about Satan?
Sabbat: There’s a reason we spend so much time
ensuring loyalty, and it’s not because we think the
Camarilla Licks are going to infiltrate us.
Ravnos: You wouldn’t believe what I’ve seen.

Quote: ‘And behold, a pale horse, and his name that sat on him was Death, and
Hell followed with him.’ Ever noticed it’s in past tense? That’s not a mistranslation.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Blood Brothers
The Blood Brothers are Kindred only in a very
loose sense. They are Sabbat shock troops, created by
Tremere and Tzimisce sorcerers in order for the Sword
of Caine to have loyal soldiers that can still pass for
human. The process of creation (for the Blood Brothers do not undergo an Embrace) washes away any individuality and personality, leaving only strong, savage,
and near-mindless quasi-vampires.

Nickname: Frankensteins
Sect: The Blood Brothers belong to the Sabbat exclusively. A Blood Brother that comes through the
creation process with his individuality intact is destroyed.

Blood Brothers are usually created in small groups of
three to 10. These groups — called “circles” — become
family units connected by a kind of hive mind. The
Sabbat also usually arranges for a Tzimisce to fleshcraft
the circle’s faces so that they are identical.
The Frankensteins are a secret weapon for the Sabbat for several reasons. The Sabbat finds that while
the loyalty of the Blood Brothers is beyond reproach,
they don’t possess much in the way of creativity. They
aren’t capable of trickery, clever tactics, or improvisation, and unless another vampire can direct them in the field in real time (which
isn’t impossible, given modern communication technology), they aren’t good
for much beyond simple, direct missions.
Second, they are difficult and risky to
create. Creating a circle of Blood Brothers means killing half a dozen people.
While the Sabbat doesn’t have a
problem with that in itself, a pattern
of disappearances can clue in mortal
authorities and Camarilla watchers
alike that the Sword of Caine is up to
something.
Finally, the Blood Brothers are more
useful as a surprise attack, and survivors
of those attacks run the risk of passing along knowledge of the Brothers’
weaknesses. Creating too many, even
if it were possible or practical, would
mean that eventually some Camarilla Tremere would figure out how
to hurt them, or even how to reverse the magic that keeps them
mindless, loyal, and useful. Some
rumors say that this has already
happened, but that the Tremere
aren’t willing to share this knowledge with the Camarilla just yet.

396

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Appearance: A Blood Brother often looks identical
to the others in his circle, barring any burns or other
marks that he might have picked up in battle. They
usually dress alike. The members of the circle grow agitated when they see each other as “different.”
Haven: Blood Brothers stay in whatever haven is
provided for them by the Sabbat. As long as the circle
is allowed to stay together, they don’t seem to care
much about amenities.
Background: A Blood Brother’s mortal life is irrelevant. All that a person needs to do to become a Blood
Brother is cross the wrong vampire’s path on the wrong
night. The Sabbat kills the target, removes his body
hair, smooths over his features, and places him with
four or five others, and after that no trace of the manthat-was remains.
Character Creation: Blood Brothers prioritize Physical Attributes and Talents. Nature and Demeanor are
usually the same; common choices are Conformist,
Bravo, and Monster. Blood Brothers don’t usually have
much in the way of Backgrounds apart from Generation and Mentor (their handler or creator).
Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Potence, Sanguinus
Weakness: Blood Brothers cannot Embrace. If they
attempt it, the mortal simply dies.
In addition, the Frankensteins literally feel each other’s pain. When a Blood Brother suffers a wound penalty, all members of the circle suffer the same penalty
for the next turn. If two Blood Brothers are wounded,
only the greater wound penalty applies. Blood Brothers

do not continually suffer these penalties unless one of
them suffers a new wound.
Organization: The bloodline as a whole has no organization. It is loyal to the Sabbat, and the members
are otherwise loyal to their circles. The Blood Brothers
treat their handlers with complete loyalty, bordering
on sycophancy. They treat other Sabbat Kindred with
quiet deference.

Stereotypes
Anyone Not Sabbat: Kill. Do not obey.
Sabbat: Obey. Do not kill.

The View From Without
Camarilla: I used to have a muse. He was
lovely, chiseled, golden-honey hair. He vanished
one night. And then I chanced to pass through
Detroit, and I saw him on the street. Six of him.
Sabbat: I know they’re creepy. Don’t think of
them as Cainites.
Followers of Set: Why didn’t we think of that?

Quote: Stranger. Kill? Watch. Watching. Kill? Watching. Kill?

Daughters of Cacophony
The Daughters of Cacophony emerged as a distinct
bloodline sometime during the 19th century. Before
that, of course, there were always Kindred who saw
music and song as a way to remain sane. Kindred scholars believe that the Daughters sprang from the blood of
either Clan Toreador (for their passionate artistic pursuit) or Malkavian (given their propensity for causing
madness), but their supernatural powers point more
toward Clan Ventrue. It’s something of a moot point,
as the “first” Daughter of Cacophony
is unknown. Regardless of their
origins, the Sirens (as they are
called in Kindred circles) are
all singers, and the bloodline has always been predominantly female.

Indeed, the Daughters of Cacophony base their
unlives on song. They wander through eternity with
music always in their ears, and that makes them seem
unfocused or flighty to other Kindred. This is one of
the reasons, along with their rarity, that neither major
Sect of vampires considers them a threat or much more
than a diversion. Individual Kindred, however, might
have occasion to meet a Siren and wonder why it is
that those who spend too much time listening to their
songs always seemed changed by the experience.
Nickname: Sirens
Sect: Sirens might fall in with whichever Sect holds
power locally. If asked, most Daughters either identify
as independents or claim membership in the Camarilla.
Appearance: A Siren might be a street musician
dressed in thrift-store chic, a pierced and tattooed
punk rocker, or a high-class entertainer with money
and prestige. Apart from the fact that the Daughters
are largely female, their appearance varies widely.
Haven: Most Sirens have a quiet room with good
acoustics where they can sing without anyone listening. As much as most Daughters love performing, they
would prefer to be alone after the “show” ends, and so
the outward appearance of their havens isn’t as important as maintaining its secrecy.
Background: The majority of Sirens were singers
before the Embrace as well. Very occasionally, a
Daughter Embraces someone who never developed
her skill at singing, but these discover their talents
swiftly.
The Daughters do not discriminate based on musical style. Jazz singer, nu-metal waif, opera diva, sultry
lounge performer — any chanteuse might be a Siren.
Character Creation: Social Attributes tend to be
primary. Expression and Performance are almost always high, and many have Fame. Sirens who die
with a following reap the benefit of their fans
(Herd). Those less lucky often still have Contacts in show business.
Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Melpominee,
Presence
Weakness: The Daughters of Cacophony
hear music constantly. This might be a form
of synesthesia, or it might be a hallucination.

398

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

This constant song distracts the Daughters as much as
it guides them. The difficulties of all their Perception
rolls increase by two. No Daughter of Cacophony may
have Alertness above 3 dots.
Organization: Their numbers are too small for them
to be truly organized, yet sometimes the Sirens act as
one. Every so often, Sirens everywhere put on a performance on the same night. They don’t necessarily sing
the same songs, but all of the waking Sirens sing at
exactly the same time.

Stereotypes

The View From Without
Camarilla: It’s the Prince’s policy not to let
fratricide go unanswered, even among the less
important Clans — would you please stop singing
a moment?
Sabbat: If we can’t get ‘em our way, you get ‘em
yours, sisters!
Giovanni: I don’t know what songs they’re talking about. I’ve got a nasty suspicion, though, that
I could listen in if I wanted to.

Camarilla: Would you like to hear another, my
lord?
Sabbat: Very well. You don’t mind if I hum a
bit, though?
Toreador: If only your art had real power, like
mine.

Quote: I heard the song as I died. It led me out of darkness and cold, and
it came to my lips with my mother-sister’s blood. And now I sing, because to
end the song would be to end all.

Gargoyles
The Tremere unveiled the Gargoyle bloodline in
AD 1167, and the Slaves have been a steady, if infrequent, part of Kindred society ever since. Gargoyles
might, in fact, be one reason that the Tremere weren’t
exterminated entirely in their first few centuries of
existence. These odd quasi-Kindred often look like
their stone namesakes — rocky-skinned, ugly,
winged creatures that exist only to serve
their masters.

obviously strained. The Gargoyles’ revolt and induction into the Camarilla has all but doomed the remaining slave Gargoyles, as their masters now monitor

Or such was the case for several hundred years. Recently,
though, many of the Slaves
have thrown off their
chains and joined the
Camarilla. Why the
Gargoyles choose
to ally themselves with the
Sect that also
protects their
former masters is anyone’s
guess. One of
the going theories
is that it’s a slap in the Warlocks’ collective face, but most Kindred don’t give
the Gargoyles credit for being that sophisticated. More likely, the Rockheads simply
realize that in the Camarilla, their talents will be recognized and no one will try and order them around (at
least not directly).
Gargoyles are created out of other Kindred, and this
ugly fact makes their creation a seldom-discussed
topic in polite vampiric society. The Tremere
start with a Gangrel, Nosferatu, or Tzimisce
vampire and perform obscene, bloody rituals
using its blood, heart, and skin. Vitae from
another vampire (from one of the other two
Clans) is used to provoke a violent mutation,
with the result that some Gargoyles look purely
hideous (Nosferatu base), some look feral (Gangrel base), and some look fleshy and sport bony protrusions (Tzimisce base). No Gargoyle can pass for
human.
The Tremere tolerate the Gargoyles’ presence in the
Camarilla as best they can — it’s not as though they
can easily re-enslave them, after all. But relations are

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

them ruthlessly for any sign of betrayal. The Tremere
also aren’t above planting hypnotic suggestions in their
Slaves’ minds, so that if they ever do rebel, they still
serve a function for the Clan.
Nickname: Traditionally Slaves, though free Gargoyles have been known to crack heads over it. Other
common nicknames are Rockheads, Runaways, Freemen, and Grotesques.
Sect: Gargoyles usually join the Camarilla. It’s not
impossible for a Slave to join the Sabbat, but the
bloodline as a whole frowns on this.
Appearance: Not all Gargoyles look like the stone
grotesques found spitting rainwater over old buildings,
but all are nightmarish. Some have tufts of hair protruding randomly over their bodies, or odd, galloping
walks. Most Gargoyles have gray, rock-like skin. All
Gargoyles have wings. These grow as the character’s
Flight (see p. 447) increases.
Haven: Slave Gargoyles sleep wherever their
masters allow them — closets, basements, crypts,
cells. Free Gargoyles prefer sleeping in havens
high above the ground. Bell towers and disused
high-rises are favorites. Gargoyles are often
muscle for other Kindred, sometimes in exchange for a bare-bones haven.
Background: Gargoyles creation rarely
shows a discernible pattern. The Change
tortures the new Gargoyle’s body, as bones
elongate and split to form the wings. The face
warps, leaving nothing to recognize the mortal
or vampire by. They rarely remember their unlife or mortal existence.
Character Creation: Created to be slaves,
Gargoyles specialize in Physical Attributes, Talents, and a few select Skills (Melee, for instance).
All Gargoyles start with a free dot of the Flight
Discipline. Appearance is always zero. Gargoyles
created by the Tremere are at the same Generation
as the Kindred that act as their “base.”
Clan Disciplines: Flight, Fortitude, Potence, Visceratika

Weakness: The Slaves are hideous. That grotesquery
takes different forms, but always results in an Appearance of zero. They are also highly susceptible to mind
control from any source. A Gargoyle’s Willpower score
(current or permanent) is considered two points lower
when used to resist such powers.
Organization: Gargoyles have a strong sense of community. They often keep communal havens. Sometimes Gargoyles petition the Prince for the release of
slave Gargoyles, but more often they just tear slave
owners to pieces. With no community, Gargoyles are
likely to Embrace and build their own.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: Our new home. Here, no one shouts
or strikes us or burns us with mirrors and light.
Here, they ask politely, and we are free to ask for
payment in blood. Paradise.
Sabbat: They are so brutal. And they love each
other so. And yet, when I think of them, my eyes
begin to burn. Why should this be?
Tremere: I will never be a slave again. Never.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Fuck you, Merlin. They belong to
all of us now.
Sabbat: Where d’ya think they get the raw materials to make those monsters? Oh, the civilized
Camarilla.
Ravnos: You headed into the city? Good luck!
Don’t forget to look up!

Harbingers of Skulls
The Harbingers of Skulls are a small bloodline that
emerged from the mists of the past and threw their lot
in with the Sabbat. The Harbingers are alleged to all be
elders, and frighteningly powerful. While their sudden
appearance suggests a long bout of torpor, they don’t
behave like recently-awakened vampires. Indeed, they
claim they have been dead these past five centuries.
The Harbingers of Skulls resemble rotting corpses,
much like the Samedi. Indeed, vampires that know of
both bloodlines suggest a common origin, but since
neither the Samedi nor the Harbingers discuss their
origins publically, it’s just speculation.

ing flowing garments or burial shrouds, the better to
highlight their affinity for death.
Haven: Unlike most Sabbat Kindred, the Harbingers of Skulls do not join packs, and therefore do not
use communal havens. They usually choose lairs away
from mortal interference, but close enough to the living that they don’t want for blood (or fresh corpses for

The Harbingers have only been members of the Sabbat for a short time, but during that time they have
made themselves invaluable. The Sword of Caine,
lacking Giovanni members, has difficulty dealing with
ghosts. This can lead to problematic hauntings, since
the Sabbat kills enough people that ghostly visitation
can become an issue. The Harbingers can exorcises
these vengeful shades, or, better yet, turn them into
incorporeal spies and slaves. And for all of this, the
Harbingers ask nothing except for favors to be repaid at a later date.
The Sabbat, for its part, isn’t usually given
to the favor-trading that one finds in the Camarilla, but what the Harbingers bring to the
table is too valuable to miss. And besides,
whether one believes the fairy tale about
noble origins and “revenge on the traitorous
moneylenders” that the Harbingers sometimes
spin, their passion is palpable. That kind of
murderous zeal is always welcome in the Sword
of Caine.
Nickname: Lazarenes
Sect: The Harbingers of Skulls belong entirely
to the Sabbat. That said, given that the bloodline
obviously has many secrets buried, it’s impossible
to know if any Lazarenes claim membership in the
Camarilla or remain independent.
Appearance: The Harbingers prefer to stay hidden
in their havens, or at least remain among Kindred,
and for good reason. They resemble emaciated,
shrunken corpses. Their skin grows taut and white,
and the gums recede, giving the impression of a
bleached, grinning skull. Most Harbingers wear-

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

their horrific arts). Crypts, disused laboratories, and
slaughterhouses are common choices.
Background: The background of a “typical” Harbinger is impossible to know. They are all elders, and who
they were in life has been lost to time. They do seem to
show evidence of a classical education, and one survivor of a battle between a Harbinger and a gang of Camarilla Brujah mentions that the Lazarene used a style
of fighting that originated in Florence. Beyond those
sparse clues, however, the Harbingers’ true identities
are unknown.
Character Creation: The Harbingers of Skulls tend
toward morbid and somewhat violent concepts. They
are obsessed with revenge, death, and the horrors beyond the grave. Social Attributes and Abilities aren’t a
priority. Mental Attributes and Knowledges are generally highly rated, but their status as elders means that
they are formidable across the board (and imply a significant amount spent on the Generation Background
to boot).
Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy
Weakness: No matter how much blood a Harbinger
consumes, her skin remains deathly pale. Moreover, all
Harbingers look like shriveled corpses. They have Appearance ratings of 0 and automatically fail Appearance rolls.
Organization: The Harbingers have some kind of internal organization, and they do keep in contact and
even meet with one another occasionally. They keep
in touch using ghostly messengers, and they travel to

meet each other using methods that other Kindred cannot match. Most of the Sabbat doesn’t quite know how
many Harbingers exist or what they might be doing.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: The more things change….
Sabbat: They can’t win. But we don’t want to
win.
Giovanni: Payback is coming very soon, and on
that day all of your money will mean nothing.

The View From Without
Camarilla: What do I have to do, spell it out for
you?
Sabbat: You should have seen the look on the
goombas’ faces when their ghosty slaves all turned
around and jumped on ‘em. I love these guys!
Giovanni: How many times do I have to say
it? The Cappadocians are dead. We killed them.
Period.

Kiasyd
The Kiasyd are a bloodline of the Lasombra Clan;
that much is obvious, given that these odd Kindred
make use of the Obtenebration Discipline. But their
aversion to iron, their odd power of Mytherceria, and
their very appearance speak to even stranger ancestry.

The Kiasyd are independent, focused more on their
studies than on the causes of the Sword of Caine. The
ones that do claim membership in the Sabbat aren’t
passionately involved in the Sect’s activities. Some
speculate that the Lasombra hold some power over
them — did the Keepers create the Kiasyd, the way the
Tzimisce created the Blood Brothers? Do the Kiasyd,
whatever their origin, owe the Lasombra some debt?
Whatever the nature of their relationship, it seems to
benefit the Sabbat.
The Kiasyd are, as a rule, calm and studious. They
prefer to remain ensconced within their havens, poring over ancient texts, maps, artifacts, and other bits
of antiquity. Other Kindred, it seems, can’t understand
how a lineage of vampires that is so very strange could
be nothing more than scholars. To hear the rumor-mill
tell it, the Kiasyd can feed only on the blood of infants,
or faeries, or unspoiled virgins. Their otherworldly heritage comes not from the Good Folk, but from demons
and the forces of Hell. Their odd appearance isn’t because of mutation in their vitae, but a God-given warning: These are not Kindred. They are other.
Nickname: Weirdlings
Sect: Most Kiasyd belong to the Sabbat, at least
nominally. A rare few identify as Camarilla vampires,
and others are independent. Since the Kiasyd don’t
spend much time around each other if they can help it
(see below), drawing a conclusion about their collective preferences is difficult.
Appearance: The Kiasyd aren’t called “Weirdlings”
just because of their behavior. Most of them are well
over six feet tall (two meters or more), willowy, and
thin. Their skin isn’t just pale, as with most vampires,
but glows faintly in moonlight. Their eyes are almondshaped and have no visible pupils. They are often violet or jet black in color. Their ears are slightly pointed.
The Kiasyd cover this with a hat or headband when
going out amongst mortals, but even so, their height
and skin tone make them stand out.
Haven: Most Kiasyd spend years building up their
havens, improving security, library facilities, and other
amenities. They are fiercely protective of their homes,
and they do not allow guests without explicit invitations. When they do invite guests, however, they treat
them well, offering vintage vitae, comfortable rooms
and, of course, plenty of reading material.

404

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Background: Museum curators, talented students, librarians, rare book experts, and academics of all stripes
are likely choices for Kiasyd Embraces. The Weirdlings
want their progeny to be studious, polite, and educated,
and they don’t want to take the time instructing them
in the basics of erudite understanding.
Character Creation: Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary, though all Kiasyd have some
degree of Etiquette. Occult is, of course, a common
Ability. Resources, Generation, and Contacts (with
other Kindred) are the only common Backgrounds. Kiasyd have difficulty mingling with mortals long enough
to gain others.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: A grand experiment. I don’t think
it has run its course quite yet, but it has so much
ground to make up.
Sabbat: What is the color of regret? What is the
flavor of a bad debt? Like rust in my mouth.
Ravnos: They have some sense of how reality
really works. A shame that they squander it on
parlor tricks.

Clan Disciplines: Dominate, Mytherceria, Obtenebration
Weakness: Besides their somewhat freakish appearance, Kiasyd also have an allergy to iron. Touching
iron requires an immediate roll to avoid frenzy, and any
weapons made from cold iron inflict aggravated damage to Kiasyd.
Organization: The Kiasyd don’t enjoy each other’s
company, which is strange, considering how little they
have in common with everyone else. After a short period of instruction (50 years at the most, and this period
has grown much shorter in modern nights), a Kiasyd
childe is released from her sire’s haven and is no longer
the elder Kiasyd’s responsibility.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Proof positive that the Sabbat needs
to be exterminated now. They’ll accept anyone,
even demon worshippers.
Sabbat: Three vampires walk into a bar, and the
fourth was a Weirdling, so the bar decapitated
him. Get it?
Ravnos: Do not turn your back on these guys,
spit on the ground where they’ve walked, and for
the love of all that’s holy, do not steal their books.

Quote: I didn’t invite you in. Leave. Touch nothing except the
floor and the doorknob, or I swear on the moon and the stars I will
have you on the other side of that mirror by morning.

Nagaraja
A bizarre bloodline of flesh-eating witches, the Nagaraja are legends, feared by Kindred on all sides of the
Jyhad. As a result of their hideous appetites, the Nagaraja have been hunted to near extinction in the modern nights by political enemies and the ghosts upon
whom they prey. A few of these vampires still prowl
the darkness, however, continuing their subtle plans.
Although not particularly forthcoming with their
origins, the Nagaraja supposedly hail from the
Middle East. They are associated with
a death cult in that region that ritually consumed human flesh and opened
gateways into the lands of the dead.
How these cultists became vampires is
lost to history, but those few Kindred
that have met the Nagaraja have
theories: maybe a wandering Giovanni trader Embraced them, perhaps
they tried to follow in Tremere’s
footsteps, or they could be the last
surviving Cappadocians. The Nagaraja refuse to confirm or deny
such speculations, however,
so the truth and rumor
continue to entwine
around these mysterious Kindred.

Appearance: Nagaraja have pointed, irregular teeth,
rather than the usual retractable fangs. This means
that they seldom smile, and they tend to speak quietly
around mortals — unless they plan to eat them.
Haven: The Nagaraja take havens where they can.
One thing that the Flesh-Eaters do try to incorporate
into their havens, when they can, is a means for disposing of bodies. They do not have the luxury of
merely sipping a bit of blood the way
other Kindred do.

Some of the FleshEaters belong to a Sect
of vampires called
the Tal’Mahe’Ra or
the “True Black Hand,” apparently distinct
from the Black Hand of the Sabbat. What
the Tal’Mahe’Ra is doing in the Deadlands
isn’t clear, nor why they war with the Restless Dead, but their city in the Underworld is
home to a number of the Nagaraja. Those
in the land of the living are independent,
now seeking to eke out whatever unlife
they can.
Nickname: Flesh-Eaters
Sect: The Nagaraja as a whole
refuse membership in either the
Camarilla or the Sabbat, but in
Camarilla cities they follow the
rules as well as they can (given
their weakness).

406

Background: Most Nagaraja are well-educated, and
many have some medical
knowledge (either from
their mortal lives or acquired post-Embrace). The
bloodline’s small numbers
make further assertions difficult to support. Some Nagaraja were priests or cultists
before the Embrace, some
antiquarians, and some exorcists or ghost-hunters.
Character Creation: Nagaraja usually have solitary or
selfish concepts and Natures,
though their Demeanors may
be practically anything. Mental Attributes are usually primary, as are Knowledges. The
most common Backgrounds
for Nagaraja are Contacts,
Resources, and Retainers,
though a few twisted Mentors
sometimes Embrace childer.
Clan Disciplines:
Auspex,
Dominate,
Necromancy
W e a k ness: The Nagaraja require
raw flesh in

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

addition to blood to survive. For every night a Nagaraja
goes without consuming flesh, he loses one cumulative
die from all his Physical dice pools. Eating one point
worth of flesh restores one die to these pools until the
vampire has “caught up.” A human body has 10 “flesh
points,” which work just like blood points: A Nagaraja consuming one flesh point increases his blood pool
by one. Unlike blood points, however, taking a “flesh
point” from a vessel does one health level of unsoakable lethal damage to that vessel. The flesh the Nagaraja consume must be relatively fresh, though not necessarily “alive.” Indeed, some Nagaraja keep stores of
ritually preserved corpses in their havens. This weakness does not allow them to eat food or consume other
liquids.
Organization: While some claim this bloodline
belongs to the Tal’Mahe’Ra in its entirety, there are
ample exceptions. A given Nagaraja might keep contact with another, but the bloodline as a whole has no
organization.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: An umbrella, until the drops grow
heavy enough to break it.
Sabbat: Perhaps we can kill enough of them?
No. The contagion has taken root.
Giovanni: You think you’re so powerful and
decadent? How quaint.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Ghost problem? Go out to that
busted-down house on 65th and follow the smell.
You’ll find a guy that can help you. Bring along a
mortal you don’t like.
Sabbat: These guys have backup you can’t see or
touch. Beyond that, no idea.
Giovanni: Hey, when did we pick up a bunch of
towel-heads?

from it for as long as I can.

Salubri
The Salubri were once a true Clan. Their Clan
founder, Saulot, was said to be a superlative warrior
as well as a fair-minded judge. It was also said that he
grew progressively more disgusted with Kindred affairs
over time, and weary of the constant, bloody cycles of
violence and betrayal. He left his home for lands far to
the east. When he returned, he was changed. He was
tranquil and contemplative, but also somewhat fatalistic. Most surprisingly, though, he had developed a third
eye in his forehead. Saulot Embraced new childer, and
his Clan slowly split into two distinct lines — the “warrior” and “healer” Salubri. For centuries, they acted as
advisors, bodyguards, and sages to other Kindred and,
to a lesser extent, mortals.

Appearance: Each Salubri has a third eye in the center of their forehead. Otherwise, the Salubri are too
few in number for any generalization about their appearances to be possible. Their ranks in modern nights
have included children, the elderly, and adults of all
races.

And then came the diablerie of Saulot.
The mages of the newly created Tremere line found
Saulot’s torpid body, and drained his blood and soul.
They usurped the power of the one of the Clans of
Caine, and sent the Salubri into a downward spiral from
which they never really recovered. Tonight, rumor has
it that only seven members of the once-respected line
exist at any given time.
The rumors die hard, however. Modern Kindred
know of the Salubri as diablerists who consume their
own sires (and do it openly — patricide is hardly unknown among the other Clans, but they don’t admit to
it) and remove the souls of other Kindred. The Soulsuckers are, supposedly, a Clan of defilers and liars from
centuries past, possibly involved with demon worship,
and demonstrably part of the Sabbat (see Salubri antitribu, p. 431). They ask, quite reasonably, how the
Salubri are able to achieve Golconda with any regularity. They wonder how any line can sustain itself with
so few members. And, finally, they pose this question:
even if these first two notions are taken as given, why
would the Salubri need to submit to diablerie? Why do
their childer need to consume their sires’ souls, if not
for some defect in the bloodline itself?
Nickname: Cyclops, or, less kindly, Soulsuckers
Sect: The Salubri are independent, though they do
sometimes masquerade as other Clans and blend in
with the Camarilla. The Salubri, however, are just trying to survive long enough to reach Golconda and pass
along their blood. Sectarian politics mean nothing to
them.

408

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Haven: Salubri are unwelcome in most cities, and
that means their havens are situated in isolated environments. They also usually have multiple escape
routes, and only have what possessions the character
can carry in a backpack. Quick departures are not uncommon for the members of this bloodline, so Salubri
don’t get attached to their havens.
Background: The Salubri Embrace people whom
they feel can find Golconda. Healers, teachers, empaths, and other people with high Humanity ratings
are good choices, although occasionally Salubri Embrace evil people in hopes of seeing them redeemed
(or, at least, setting them on that path).
Character Creation: Social or Mental Attributes are
often primary, as are Knowledges. Most Salubri also
have decent ratings in Empathy. All Salubri must take
five dots of Generation (to represent their diablerie of
their sires), and most have at least a dot of Herd as
well.
Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Obeah
Weakness: Salubri have difficulty feeding on unwilling vessels. If a Cyclops attempts it, she loses a point
of Willpower.
Organization: The Salubri are not, as a bloodline,
organized. In fact, when Salubri do meet, it tends to
be on the instruction of their sires — the dying wish

of a given Cyclops to her childe might be to seek out
another member of the bloodline and deliver a message
or pay respects.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: Judge a man by the company he
keeps.
Sabbat: Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly, warriors
gotta make war.
Tremere: The enemy. For them, there can be no
forgiveness.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard the same
things you have. Consider the source.
Sabbat: We’ve got some open slots, any time you
folks wanna man up.
Giovanni: Hey, Tremere. I feel your pain.

ever carried is heavier than what this new eye has seen.

Samedi
If the Nosferatu are repulsive and the Harbingers of
Skulls are hideous, a word hasn’t yet been invented to
describe the Samedi. Resembling nothing so much as
walking, rotting corpses, these odd vampires take their
name and their origin from the Caribbean and the religion of vodoun (popularly known as voodoo). Baron

Samedi, in legend, was a loa of death and ancestor worship. The vampires that bear his name and visage (for
Samedi is often portrayed as a corpse, albeit not one
so disgusting as the Stiffs) also often share his rude,
blunt demeanor. In fact, a vampire going by the name
of “Baron Samedi” seems to be the founder, or at least
the oldest extant member, of the bloodline.
The Samedi might seem to be an offshoot of the
Nosferatu, but their powers of Thanatosis — a Discipline dedicated to manipulating dead flesh — speak of
a connection to the Giovanni or their doomed predecessors, the Cappadocians. If that is the case, though,
the Samedi and the Giovanni went their separate ways
long ago, for neither has anything good to say about
the other. The reason for this enmity is not something
that members of either line discuss in public, but the
Giovanni apparently have a history with Baron Samedi himself. The Baron, still active in the bloodline’s
affairs, refuses to discuss the “deal” that he had with
Augustus Giovanni, but it must have been something
of gravity for the mutual dislike to persist.
Samedi take the roles of enforcers and assassins
in Kindred society. They don’t do it on ideological grounds, like the Assamites, and thus they find
work with Kindred who want
to get what they paid for.
The Samedi do not take
contracts against Nosferatu or, strangely,
Giovanni Kindred
without a heavy
fee, speaking to some
regard or fear of these
Clans. As with so many
other facts about their
line, the Samedi have nothing to say on the matter.
Nickname: Stiffs
Sect: Samedi occasionally join
the Camarilla or the Sabbat, but
for the most part they consider
themselves independent.
Appearance: Saying that a Samedi resembles a rotting corpse is, sadly, in no
way a euphemism. Their flesh is soft and
tends to leak fluid if poked too hard. Their

410

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

ears and noses rot away (but still function normally),
and tiny bits of their skin tend to slough off and regrow.
Skin retracts from the eyes and teeth, giving them the
appearance of grinning skulls, but too much meat clings
to the cranium for them to achieve the cleaner horror
of the Harbingers of Skulls. Some Samedi are leathery
and dry, like unwrapped mummies. These Stiffs still
stink, but their stench is more reminiscent of rotted
flowers and old decay than fresh putrescence.
Haven: The Samedi make havens in places where
a moldering corpse and its stench aren’t out of place.
Morgues, mortuaries, graveyards, and meat packing
plants house the occasional Samedi. Some members of
the bloodline choose to dwell below ground like the
Nosferatu, but this does lead to conflict between the
Stiffs and the Sewer Rats.
Background: The Samedi are a relatively young
line. No Samedi older than 250 years is known to exist.
Most of the older ones hail from the Caribbean islands
or the southern United States. Neonate Samedi don’t
always share this connection to vodoun, but frequently
were close to death (one way or another) before the
Embrace.
Character Creation: While Physical Attributes are a
priority for those Samedi working as killers and enforcers, many Samedi lean toward Mental Traits. Samedi
rarely have the Herd or Resources Backgrounds, and
their standoffish and solitary nature means that Mentor and Allies are equally rare.
Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Obfuscate, Thanatosis
Weakness: The Samedi, as mentioned, are putrid
beyond words. Samedi characters have Appearance
ratings of 0, and automatically fail Appearance rolls.
Organization: The Samedi are too rare to be organized. They might cross each other’s paths occasion-

ally and trade stories, but no plan or schedules exists
for these meetings, at least as far as anyone outside the
bloodline can tell.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: Careful. These jokers have a built-in
reason to set us on fire, and they aren’t afraid to
use it.
Sabbat: They’re more honest than the Camarilla, anyway. But I smell like a dead asshole already; I don’t need to actually be a dead asshole.
Giovanni: Just because you’re older than me
don’t mean I give a fuck what you think, dago.

The View From Without
Camarilla: We’re all agreed that our continued
survival rests on the mortals not knowing about
us, right? How about we get rid of the walking,
talking, Masquerade breach?
Sabbat: They follow the Baron, I prefer to dance
with Erzulie. But it’s nice to know that the family
still talks.
Giovanni: So they can stuff shit into their dead
stomachs. That’s not Necromancy. That’s, like,
biology.

True Brujah
The Clan Brujah that most Kindred know in the
modern nights is not, according to legend, the true
lineage of the Antediluvian known as “Brujah.” The
strange bloodline known as the True Brujah claim that
Brujah’s childe, Troile, committed
diablerie upon him and stole control of the Clan. Brujah, it is
said, was not the hot-blooded
warrior/scholar that many
vampires associate with the
Rabble, but rather a staid,
passionless introvert. Why,
then, he chose to Embrace a
maniac like Troile in the first
place is a mystery that will likely
never be fully explained.
The True Brujah
were never subject to
a massive purge as the
Salubri or the Cappadocians were, but they
don’t Embrace often
and never recovered
from the theft of their
Clan status. Their
city — the Carthage
of Kindred myth, in
which vampires openly
ruled over mortals —
supposedly died out due
to the treachery of Troile’s
childer (though other stories
suggest demonic influence).
From there, the bloodline
faded from history. A few
notable members of the
bloodline appear throughout history, but by the
modern nights only Kindred historians or those
who chance to meet
them can speak of their
existence.
Whatever the truth
of their origins, the
True Brujah have remained a small but

412

constant presence in Kindred society. Sometimes they
wear their true nature openly, while other times they
claim membership in other Clans (stating their Clan
as “Brujah,” for example, and not bothering to correct
the misapprehension that ensues). Their primary focus
is the pursuit of knowledge, and to that end they have
made some strange alliances. The True Brujah occasionally ally with the Followers of Set, and sometimes
even provide services as consultants to the Sabbat in
exchange for access to secrets and locations normally
closed to them.
Nickname: Sages
Sect: The Sages have become more or less independent. They follow the Camarilla’s rules when in their
cities, and avoid the Sabbat lest they become pressed
into service or destroyed. While it isn’t impossible for a
True Brujah to join the Sword of Caine, most of them
can’t summon up the necessary fervor.
Appearance: In nights past, the True Brujah were
predominantly of Greek or North African descent. As
the centuries wore on, though, the Sages Embraced
progeny from across Europe and, eventually, the New
World. In modern nights, True Brujah tend to dress
professionally, the better to fit in with the academic
settings they prefer.
Haven: Some True Brujah maintain multiple havens around the world, which they use as they travel
pursuing whatever kind of knowledge they find most
fascinating. Others stay closer to a given city, generally with a centuries-old university or other center of
learning nearby. In either case, their havens tend to be
clean, well-maintained, and austere.
Background: It’s not entirely accurate to say that
the True Brujah only Embrace academics and scholars, but it’s fairly rare for them to do otherwise. Sages
sometimes Embrace out of curiosity or even spite, but
for the most part they choose people whose capacity of
learning and accumulated knowledge will benefit their
sires.
Character Creation: Mental Attributes and Knowledges are usually primary. True Brujah sires instruct
their childer in the basics of Occult and some form of
combat (it’s just not practical to be unable to fight).
Nature and Demeanor are often similar, if not identical, and never anything forceful or passionate. Com-

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

mon Backgrounds include Resources, Contacts, and
Herd.
Clan Disciplines: Potence, Presence, Temporis
Weakness: True Brujah lose much of their emotional
capacity when they are Embraced, and their ability for
sympathy continues to deteriorate as they grow older.
All Conscience and Conviction rolls are made at +2
difficulty (maximum 10), and ratings in Conscience,
Conviction, Humanity, and Paths of Enlightenment
cost double the normal experience costs.
Organization: While their rarity precludes frequent
meetings, the bloodline comes together twice a century to discuss matters that affect them all. The eldest
members of the bloodline determine the location and
specific time of the meeting. Outside of these larger
meetings, many True Brujah stay in contact via letters,
whether handwritten or online.

The View From Without
Camarilla: Yeah, they seem all smart and shit.
My sire told me stories. Don’t trust ‘em, just
stake ‘em.
Sabbat: I spent a very pleasant evening conversation with one of their number some years back.
I lament that their temperament doesn’t induce
them to join us. At least they are tactful.
Followers of Set: Our newest friends. We are
still, I admit, at a loss for how best to tempt them.
They don’t seem to want anything.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: After a certain point, a system becomes self-sustaining, and even if it no longer has
any resemblance to its original purpose, it is too
large to dismantle.
Sabbat: I strongly suspect that the future of all
Kindred can be found in this Sect. I also hope I
am wrong.
Brujah: A misguided, angry thief is still a thief.

might spare you tonight, if I think that tomorrow you might still interest me.

Ahrimanes
The strange tale of the Ahrimanes begins with a Sabbat Gangrel antitribu named Muricia. Caught between
two warring factions of Sabbat Gangrel, she watched
as her packmates were pulled into the conflict and
ultimately killed. She renounced the Sabbat and the
Gangrel Clan entirely, now calling herself “an
Ahrimane,” and called upon shamanic magic
to alter herself. How exactly this was accomplished is still a mystery. One theory
is that Muricia was an anomaly even
before she attempted her magical working, and had access to powers
that other vampires didn’t. Another (possibly more plausible)
theory is that Muricia had help
from mortal sorcerers who
were hoping the effect
would spread throughout
the Kindred of the world,
sterilizing them and preventing any new vampires
from being created.

had become. She kept the animalistic features that she
can gained during her previous unlife, however, and it
may have been her cat-like eyes that lent her bloodline
its nickname.
Muricia extended the offered of “becoming Ahrimane” to any female Gangrel who wished it. She
made it quite clear she was not interested in
performing the process on male Kindred,
though the specific reasons for this remain
unclear. A few Gangrel joined her, taking
havens in the southern United States and
avoid contacting with other Sabbat.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

The Ahrimanes were never numerous, and although
they remained nominally allied with the Sabbat, Muricia
made it quite clear that they
were to be left alone. This isolation may have doomed them,
however. In the late 1990s, all
contact with the Cats ceased.
Investigators found, sometime
later, that their havens were
empty, and no one has heard
from them since. Most Sabbat
believe that the Ahrimanes
were destroyed, but concede
that it is possible that Muricia might have led her
line on a

spiritual pilgrimage somewhere out of the Kindred’s
reach.
Nickname: Cats
Sect: The Ahrimanes were an independent Sect, or
more accurately, a group of independent individuals.
They identified more with the Sabbat than the Camarilla, if only because they did not wish to answer to any
elder (expect perhaps Muricia).
Appearance: All Ahrimanes were female, and most
were either of African American or Native American
descent (Muricia, apparently, was not partial to Caucasian vampires). Most Ahrimanes never went anywhere
unarmed, and dressed to fight. Many Ahrimanes had
animal features left over from their time as Gangrel.
Haven: Muricia was a vampire of some means, and
she purchased houses on the outskirts of several cities
in the American South (in Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Georgia especially). New Ahrimanes could make their
own arrangements or stay in one of these homes.
Background: All Ahrimanes were Gangrel before
their magical transformation. As such, their Backgrounds varied just as much as the Beasts’. The sort of
Gangrel who became an Ahrimane was female, usually
non-white, and frustrated by the situation in her Sect
or city.
Character Creation: All Ahrimanes had at least
three dots in Mentor, to represent Muricia’s guidance.
Combat Abilities and Physical Attributes were common, but this was as much from the Ahrimanes’ Gangrel background as anything else. Likewise, a dot or two
of Protean or Fortitude was common, since Ahrimanes
began unlife as Gangrel.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Presence, Spiritus
Weakness: An Ahrimanes’ blood was inert. They
were unable to create childer or blood bonds, and a

person consuming Ahrimane blood did not become a
ghoul.
Organization: Since all Ahrimanes effectively had
the same “sire,” they were all beholden to Muricia. She
did not attempt to control or rule her creations, but did
keep tabs on them and help them develop their powers of Spiritus. The bloodline was fairly tight-knit, as
vampire “families” go, and threatening one Ahrimane
generally meant battling several.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: I would suffocate under their rule.
Sabbat: Let them think they run us. They fear
us, and they are not wrong to do so.
Gangrel: The only vampires that understand
true freedom.

The View From Without
Camarilla: I do wonder, sometimes, if I was
wrong in rejecting her offer. Would I see the
things she claims to have seen? Would others
think I was as crazy as I thought her?
Sabbat: You know you can’t train a fucking cat.
Assamites: Changing the blood is possible. I
don’t like the change they made, but still, their
ambition is admirable.

Anda
The Anda were a Gangrel offshoot, created by a Methuselah called Dobrul the Brave. Dobrul, a wanderer
with great respect for the Mongol hordes, Embraced
several of their warriors. These vampires became the

spirit warriors of the steppe, following the nomadic
Mongol tribes and protecting them from outward
threats.
The Anda had intricate rites governing the Embrace
of new Kindred. Once a candidate was selected, any
Anda in the area met for a discussion on that candidate’s qualities. The prospective Tartar had to be an
impressive warrior, but tempered enough in nature
to understand that only by protecting his tribe
from outward supernatural threats could he keep
it healthy enough to feed from. Once the decision was made, the prospective sire would wash the
candidate in a river, a ritual funerary bathing in the
Mongol tradition. He would then drain and Embrace
the new vampire.
This kind of ritual and observance governed much of
the Anda’s existence. Long and lonely nights wandering the steppe, either with the Mongols or alone (and
they did wander alone, sometimes even into Western
Europe), the Anda’s Beast was the only company.
Small wonder that these Kindred viewed themselves as
spiritual warriors, their brutal ethos the only bulwark
against madness and depredation.
The Anda made war against a variety of foes. They
would join their nomad tribes against whatever enemies they chose (as far as they could, since not all
battles were fought at night). They also clashed with
native Chinese shapeshifters and vampires, and it was
this latter group that proved the undoing of the Anda
in the 14th century. The bloodline’s heyday was the
reign of Kublai Khan, and during this time they could
be found openly celebrating their undead nature in
China. When Kublai died, the Anda fell into decline,
and in the modern nights none are known to exist.
Nickname: Tartars
Sect: Wandering Anda might join a particular vampire’s court, at least for a time, but their irresistible
push to keep moving prevented them from becoming
permanent fixtures anywhere in Europe. In their own
lands, they watched over Mongol tribes called yasun,
parasitically protecting and feeding from the mortals.
Appearance: The Anda Embraced exclusively from
the Mongol tribes, so they were short, stocky, and bowlegged from a lifetime of riding. The skin of an Anda
faded to an odd brown-yellow following the Embrace.

416

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Haven: The Anda dwelled on the steppe, far enough
away from their yasun to avoid discovery, but close
enough to catch up with them when night fell. The
truly monstrous or depraved among them did not protect a tribe, but led a solitary unlife, feeding as opportunity permitted. These poor souls typically fell to torpor from hunger, and if any Anda still exist, it is likely
one of these horrors, sleeping buried in somewhere in
China.

Organization: On the night of the new moon, all
Anda within a given radius met to discuss the movements of their yasun and what kinds of threats might
require their collective attention. The eldest Anda in
such a gathering was called the khan, and all others
were expected to submit to his authority.

Background: The Anda did not Embrace capriciously. They chose their candidates carefully, since
this choice made a statement about who would protect
their people. All Anda were skilled horsemen, trackers, warriors, and, to some degree, shamans.

Stereotypes

Character Creation: Unlife on the steppe was harsh.
Physical Attributes were generally primary, with Talents and Skills sharing priority (especially martial ones
— all Anda had some facility in Melee, Brawl, and
Survival). All of the Anda’s Disciplines were important, but neonate Anda generally found that learning
Earth Meld was a matter of survival.
Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean
Weakness: Like the Gangrel from which they were
descended, Anda gained animal features from frenzying. Unlike the Gangrel, though, Anda gained such a
feature once every other frenzy. However, the Anda suffered a further weakness — for each day after the third
that an Anda slept within the same one-mile area, all
dice pools were halved (to a minimum pool of one).

High Clans: Strange tribes. Strange khans.
Low Clans: Some truly do seem low — diseased, mad, weak. And others I would glad call
brother.

The View From Without
High Clans: Savages that ride with the Tartars.
The low-born know their own.
Low Clans: They wander the world, drinking
only blood, sleeping in the dirt. They are closer to
Caine than I, then, and I thank them for it.

Cappadocians
The story of Clan Cappadocian is tragic, but illustrative of the parasitic cycle of Kindred existence. Nothing lasts forever in vampiric circles, but nothing ever
truly dies.
The Cappadocians were a Clan that focused on death
and undeath. Their founder, an ancient known simply
as “Cappadocius” (“of Cappadocia”), did not attempt
to rule his Clan. He asked only that they continue the
search for truth and the secrets of life and death. The
Clan’s ancestral roots were rumored to be somewhere
in Asia Minor, but by the end of the Dark Ages they
had spread throughout Europe. Known as scholars,
mystics, and necromancers, the Cappadocians were as
firmly entrenched in the Cainite society of their time
as any of the Clans of the Camarilla are tonight.

of an ethereal appearance. The Cappadocians dressed
appropriately for their station and role.
Haven: Cappadocians preferred a measure of solitude
when choosing their havens. Although they had to stay
close enough to mortals to feed, they often chose quiet

The Graverobbers expanded their knowledge base
by Embracing members of important families or promising scholars. By the 13th century they had inroads
across Europe, in monasteries, universities, and in the
courts of royalty, but also members and ghouls among
the working classes. Everyone must eventually die,
the Cappadocians realized, and every death was
potentially a lesson.
Their inclusive attitude may have spelled the
Clan’s doom. They accepted a Venetian merchant family called the Giovanni (the family’s
propensity for summoning up and controlling
ghosts had as much to do with their Embrace as their skill with finance). Over the
following centuries, the Giovanni worked
their way into the hierarchy of the Clan, until Augustus Giovanni committed diablerie
upon Cappadocius. Over the next few centuries, the Giovanni systematically destroyed the
remaining Cappadocians. In modern nights, only
small remnants survive, such as the Harbingers of
Skulls. The lineage of these remnants is largely unknown.
Nickname: Graverobbers
Sect: The Cappadocians did not survive long
enough to take a side in the Camarilla/Sabbat divide.
Appearance: The Graverobbers were pale and
corpse-like, even for vampires. Their hair often darkened slightly after the Embrace, giving them even more

locales to make their homes — monasteries, crypts,
and even sewers or cisterns. The Cappadocians acting
as scholars or advisors enjoyed a better standard of unlife, but even they often chose places that mortals had
no interest in exploring.
Background: As a general rule, the Cappadocians
were not concerned with ethnicity or nationality when
Embracing, meaning that it wasn’t uncommon to find
Moors, Jews, or even pagans brought into the Clan.
The Graverobbers were more inclined to Embrace people with an interest in death. That didn’t necessarily
mean causing death (though certainly they Embraced
their share of soldiers and hunters), but scholars of the
afterlife and religion, gravediggers, priests, and hermits
all found their way to Clan Cappadocian.
Character Creation: Mental Attributes and Knowledges were often primary, and rare was the Cappadocian without at least a few dots of Occult. The Clan
included warriors as well as scholars and priests, and
a Cappadocian who chose to be a tyrant could be a
frightening creature indeed. For the most part, though,
the Clan tended more toward intellectual and spiritual
pursuits, and choices of Abilities and Backgrounds reflected that.

several important cities across Europe, and it wasn’t
uncommon for Graverobbers to act as spiritual or mystical advisors to other medieval Princes. Internally, the
Clan had little strict hierarchy, though as the years
wore on the Clan’s core became more localized around
the founder (which, in turn, allowed the Giovanni to
take it over).

Stereotypes
High Clans: We have seen the death of kings,
and it is much like the death of peasants. But the
final resting places are grand, and maybe that
makes the difference.
Low Clans: When towers have fallen and kings
are thrown down, who will remember us? It will
be the low-blooded, and I hope they are kind in
their eulogies.

Clan Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Necromancy
Weakness: As mentioned, the Cappadocians exhibited a deathly pallor, and this only worsened as the
vampire grew older. Young Cappadocians were able
to pass for human (though mortals that knew what to
look for could pick them out easily), but elder Cappadocians showed shriveled skin and a much more withered countenance.
Organization: Clan Cappadocian was, in its heyday,
an important Clan historically. It claimed domain in

Children of Osiris
Egyptian mythology abounds with tales of the rivalry
between Set and his brother, Osiris. Knowledgeable
vampires are aware that the Followers of Set claim descent from an Antediluvian who took his name from
that Egyptian serpent-god (though the Setites certainly seem to think Set actually was the god). If that’s the

case, such Kindred wonder, who was Osiris? A mortal
spellcaster that was Embraced? Set’s childe? Or perhaps
another Antediluvian, lost to time and destroyed millennia ago?
Whatever the truth about Set, there was once a powerful vampire called Osiris. He was a philosopher and
a scholar in an Egyptian court (whose dynasty is unknown), Embraced by an unknown vampire who believed that his knowledge of the law would make him
a useful ally in the battle to bring Egypt under Kindred
influence. Osiris, however, was horrified by his new
condition. Rather than meet the sun, though, he became determined to face and banish his personal demons, and especially his own Beast. His studies on sublimating the vampiric impulses may have helped form
the basis for the search for Golconda. At the very least,
they expanded it.
The Children of Osiris might have become a Clan
and continued into the modern nights, but Set slew
Osiris. As mortal legendry has it, Set dismembered his
“brother” and scattered his body throughout the land
of Egypt. His sister, Isis (perhaps another vampire, but
no one still extant seems to know for sure) found the
pieces and reassembled them, and impossibly, Osiris
was resurrected. Death, however, had taken its toll. His
blood was inert, and he could no longer create more
childer. This, however, did not stop him from spreading his path.
Nickname: Since even the Kindred who know about
the Children of Osiris assume them all to be dead, they
do not have a common nickname.
Sect: Strictly speaking, the Children of Osiris are a
Sect, rather than a bloodline. They do not (and, by
virtue of their own laws, cannot) join the Sabbat or
the Camarilla.
Appearance: Since the Children can hail from any
Clan or bloodline, their appearance can vary widely.
They all shave their heads every evening upon awakening, and when in their temples they wear white robes
adorned with mystical symbols and hieroglyphs. When
leaving their temples on business, they dress simply
and stay inconspicuous.
Haven: The few remaining Children of Osiris in the
world dwell in one of several temples. These temples
are well-hidden and kept secret from other Kindred,

420

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

meaning that they tend to be in areas that don’t boast
much of a vampire population.
Background: Children of Osiris renounce their
Clans because they hate their condition, but do not
wish to commit suicide. The search for Golconda leads
some Kindred to the Children, while others encounter
the Sect after running afoul of the Followers of Set.
Character Creation: Children of Osiris can be from
any Clan (except the Followers of Set; while the Children might be willing to accept a truly repentant Setite, the situation has never come up). The character
can have any combination of Attributes and Abilities,
and they retain whatever knowledge of Disciplines
they had before joining. Nature and Demeanor tend to
be the same — the Children of Osiris are straightforward and honest.
Clan Disciplines: As appropriate for the character’s
original Clan. Children of Osiris can also learn Bardo
as an in-Clan Discipline.
Weakness: As appropriate for the character’s original Clan.
Organization: Each temple is under the supervision
of an elder Child of Osiris (called the Undying King),
and the entire Sect answers to a mysterious vampire
called the Grand Undying King, rumored to be a direct childe of Osiris from before he lost the ability to
Embrace. The Sect focuses on maintaining their Humanity, which is of course a difficult enough concern,
but also thwarting the machinations of the Followers
of Set without the Serpents knowing they still exist.

Stereotypes
Camarilla: The best option for most Kindred,
and still not nearly good enough.
Sabbat: If they are less evil than the Serpents, it
is only because the Sword of Caine occasionally
kills them.
Followers of Set: Osiris came back from death
to avenge himself on Set. And so shall we.

The View From Without
Camarilla: My research indicates that Osiris and
Set may have actually existed as Kindred at one
time. Strange, then, that Set’s “descendants” are
hale and healthy and selling drugs on the corner,
while Osiris’ seem to have vanished entirely.
Sabbat: Nah, man. Luis went soft. We hit that
gang of Setites last month, we got separated, and
then he’s talking about “I won’t kill anymore”
or some bullshit. Bishop probably torched him.
Forget it.
Followers of Set: Feels good to win, even if
the loser hasn’t really been a real concern in a
thousand years.

feather of Ma’at. Until I am sure, I will remain.

Lamia
The Lamia were a bloodline of Cainites devoted
to defending Clan Cappadocian. The founder of the
bloodline, Lamia, claimed to be a daughter of Lilith,
Adam’s first wife. According to legend, a Cappadocian
elder named Lazarus found her performing sacred rites
to Lilith, the Dark Mother. Impressed by her skill and
perhaps taken with her fierce beauty, he Embraced her.

While she died and the Change took her, Lilith gave
her a vision, a deep understanding of her future and
that of the Cappadocians. When she recovered, she
whispered something to Lazarus, and the Cappadocian
elder fled in terror.
Lamia did find her way back to the Clan, though,
and her bloodline became the guardians of the Cappadocians. They were never very numerous, but important Graverobbers often had at least one Gorgon
standing at their side. The Lamia learned to feed sparingly, since their bite carried disease, and developed
their own path of Necromancy based on the four humors. Over the centuries, they became an important
resource for the Cappadocians. And yet, behind their
loyalty was perhaps a greater dedication to the Dark
Mother and to the vision of their founder.
The Revelation of the Dark Mother seems to have
led the line to tragedy, however. The Lamia died defending the Cappadocians when the Giovanni subsumed the Clan. Augustus Giovanni murdered Lamia
herself following his diablerie of Cappadocius, and the
last known member of the bloodline was destroyed in
1718 as part of a Camarilla blood hunt.
Nickname: Gorgons
Sect: The Lamia were somewhere between the High
and Low Clans. They were not a Clan, but were considered part of Clan Cappadocian in most Cainites’
understanding. Other Cainites, however, treated them
respectfully as servants or soldiers, both out of deference to their skills and to their patrons.
Appearance: The Lamia did not share the Cappadocians’ pallor. Many of them were of Mediterranean or Semitic descent, though as the
Cappadocians traveled across Europe
with their Gorgon
bodyguards, other
nationalities came
into the bloodline as
well. The bloodline was
predominantly female, but it wasn’t uncommon for Lamia to dress as men (usually armed and armored).
Haven: The Lamia shared havens
with their Cappadocian patrons. When
they made their own, they often chose
crypts and sarcophagi, preferring to be

422

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

alone among the dead (feeding on the recently dead
also minimized their chance of starting an outbreak of
plague).
Background: Since the Lamia Embraced women
almost exclusively, they seldom had the chance to
Embrace trained warriors. Instead, the Gorgons often
chose women who had some experience with death.
Women who had attempted or contemplated suicide,
or had recently committed murder, were common
choices. Likewise, women with a pronounced interest in black magic or scholarly pursuits in general were
candidates for the Lamia Embrace. Training in combat
could come after the gift of immortality.
Character Creation: All Lamia had some combat
training, usually from their sires. Physical or Mental
Attributes might be primary, as were Skills. The Lamia
also tended to have some familiarity with Occult, both
from the rites taught to them by their own bloodline
and simply by proximity to the Cappadocians.

Organization: The sire-childe relationship in the Lamia was very strong, as most Lamia had to remain with
their sires for at least a year to achieve the necessary
combat skill to be of use. Lamia remained the leader
of the bloodline until her destruction, but her first and
most important order to her daughter was to serve the
Cappadocians.

Stereotypes
High Clans: Our masters’ fellows cannot be
trusted. Bow, but with one hand on your blade.
Low Clans: Their humors are purer. Sometimes
far too pure.

Clan Disciplines: Fortitude, Necromancy, Potence
Weakness: The Lamia carried the “Seed of Lilith,” a
wasting disease spread by their bite. Anyone the Lamia
fed upon was required to make a Stamina roll (difficulty 6 for women, 8 for men). If the roll failed, the
victim contracted a Black Plague-like pox that was fatal within several days. Any vampire that consumed
Lamia blood became a carrier of the disease until all of
the Lamia vitae had been purged from his body.

The View From Without
High Clans: The Graverobbers have their own
class of bodyguards. Hmm. It’s sad that they
need them.
Low Clans: Something is horribly wrong with
these plague-bringers.

Lhiannan
The Lhiannan boasted a strange creation story. They
claimed that their founder — a vampire simply known
as the Crone — became bonded with a spirit of the
forests. This spirit was a desperate, jealous being that
could apparently see that people would destroy the forests and burn the trees that comprised them. Joining
with an undying predator, then, was apparently the
spirit’s attempt at dodging this fate. Whether or not
any of that is true, the Lhiannan did have a connection
to the natural world that no other vampire, not even
the Gangrel, can equal.

man-made haven and kill or enslave the inhabitants,
or very rarely eke out an existence on the periphery of
human civilization by taking the role of a shaman or
wise woman.

Whenever a Lhiannan Embraced, a shard of that original spirit broke off and empowered the new Cainite.
This spirit-shard allowed Lhiannan to use their Ogham
Discipline, which, in turn, enabled the style of unlife
that the Lhiannan enjoyed. It also made the Lhiannan territorial above all else, and the Druids were quite
limited in their mobility. The Lhiannan, much like the
Telyavelic Tremere (see p. 438) found common cause
with the pagan peoples of Europe. This, unfortunately,
put them into conflict with Cainites and mortals who
followed the Christian faith.
The bloodline was never numerous (especially since
creating a new Lhiannan meant that the sire grew
weaker), but the fires of the Inquisition and the spread
of the Christian religion took a harsh toll on the Druids. By the end of the 14th century, they had all been
destroyed. In modern times, though, Gangrel trade
rumors of powerful Kindred in European forests decorated with strange, bloody symbols, so perhaps some
of them survived — or perhaps the forest spirit that
initially created the bloodline has resurfaced.
Nickname: Druids
Sect: The Lhiannan did not survive to see the dawning of the Sabbat or the Camarilla. In historical
nomenclature, they were decidedly on the Low
Clan side of the social divide, and most Cainites
probably wouldn’t have known them from the
Gangrel. Lhiannan rarely joined coteries, limited
as they were in mobility.
Appearance: The Druids resembled the native people of the regions of Europe that they called home —
the British Isles, for the most part.
Haven: The Lhiannan made their havens in the
forests of Europe, constructing simple dwellings or
finding natural shelter. They would sometimes find a

424

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Background: Since performing the Embrace meant
growing weaker, the Druids only created childer out
of sheer loneliness or when they found someone who
truly impressed them. A pagan spirit-speaker with real
devotion to her craft, or a woodsman with impeccable
respect for the forests might be enough to get a Lhiannan’s attention. The Lhiannan refused to Embrace
Christians, Jews, or Muslims.

own haven and territory. The Lhiannan were generally
aware of members of their bloodline whose territories
were adjacent, but there was no system of communication in place. This, of course, may have contributed to
their eventual destruction.

Character Creation: All Lhiannan were capable of
surviving in the wilderness, and so Physical Attributes,
Skills, and Talents were important. A Lhiannan acting
as a counsel to a mortal settlement was likely to have
higher Social Attributes and appropriate Abilities.
Herd and Retainers (animals) were common Backgrounds.

Stereotypes
High Clans: No one who wears such heavy,
false robes or who shies away from blood is a
leader to me.
Low Clans: By accepting the title of “low,” they
show it to be accurate.

Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Ogham, Presence
Weakness: The Lhiannan were part nature spirit,
and the mark of their inhumanity ran strong within
them. All difficulties to detect their nature via Auspex were reduced by two, and even normal humans felt
vaguely uncomfortable in their presence. Additionally,
any Lhiannan who left her territory became agitated
— all dice pools were reduced by one die per week (to
a minimum of the character’s Stamina) that she was
gone. Once she re-entered her territory, her dice pools
returned to normal within a few hours.
Organization: Once a Lhiannan Embraced a childe,
she generally kept the new vampire around for a few
years until that childe was ready to fend for himself (and
the novelty of having someone else around wore off).
The sire would then send the childe away to find his

Noiad
Few Kindred have ever beheld the Northern Lights.
The trek to the far reaches of the world, in a place inhospitable to man, beast, or vampire, with no reliable
way to feed is enough to put even the most curious
Cainite off the idea. And yet, a bloodline of vampires
managed to dwell close enough to see these lights on
a regular basis. This line — the Noiad — felt it was
their sacred duty to witness the Northern Lights and
interpret the will of the gods. Their mortal charges, a
nomadic tribe called the Samí, lived in fear
and awe of their godlike protectors.
The Noiad defended the Samí from
outside threats, both natural and supernatural, and acted as shamans and teachers
for these wanderers. In return, the Samí gave of
their blood and kept the Noiad safe during the
long months with no darkness.

tone, of course, tended to be lighter than their stillliving comrades.
Haven: The Samí constructed mobile “havens” that
could be dragged behind them as they traveled by day.
If terrain or numbers made this impossible, the Samí
would watch in awe as their heavenly protectors sank
into the earth, only to rejoin them the next night.
Background: The Samí selected for Embrace tended
to be those with talent for divination, as well as dream
and star interpretation. The Noiad also watched children descended from families that included at least one

Of course, the touch of the Kindred corrupts everything. The Noiad protected the Samí from monsters from the wastes, and their blood allowed the
mortals to survive times of famine, but the Wanderers also refused to allow their mortal herds to
change or improve. Interlopers were turned aside
or killed, regardless of their intentions. When it
became clear that the march of Christianity (and
Lasombra working within the Church) could not
be stopped, the Noiad pushed the Samí further
north, away from the herds that would sustain
them and away from the dawning of a new
era. Whether the Noiad saw something in the
Northern Lights that spurred them to this decision, or whether it was simply fear of change, is
not important in the end. The Noiad drove the
Samí almost to destruction.
Nickname: Wanderers
Sect: The Noiad never belonged to a Sect, and were
largely apart from the vampire politics of the day (at
least until war pushed far enough north to inconvenience them). As a Gangrel offshoot, other Cainites
would have considered them a Low Clan, on the rare
occasion that other Cainites learned enough about
them to have opinions at all.
Appearance: The Noiad dwelled openly among the
Samí, and Embraced exclusively from this population.
Most Noaid were dark-haired and strongly built from
their demanding lifestyles pre-Embrace. Their skin

was not a primary concern, but only because Samí that
were not physically capable of thriving in the harsh
climates didn’t live long enough to be considered for
the Embrace anyway.
Character Creation: Physical Attributes weren’t
necessarily primary, but tended to be no worse than
average. All Noiad had good ratings in Survival and
Animal Ken, and at least a dot or two in Athletics, and
Melee. Finally, all Noiad had at least a dot of the Herd
Background.

Stereotypes
High Clans: They can pretend to know of their
god’s mind all they want. They wrote the book,
and they want to claim their god did it. I know
this trick.
Low Clans: Too many have already been
fooled. The ones that haven’t know to leave us
alone.

Clan Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Protean
Weakness: The Noiad were so intrinsically tied to
the Samí and to their role as the divine protectors of
the tribe that one of the legends about them came true.
The Samí’s protectors, it was said, could not sup from
animals, but could only take sustenance from the blood
of the chosen (that is, the Samí). The Noiad, in fact,
could not drink from animals, though they were capable of drinking from any mortal or Cainite, regardless
of nationality or ethnicity.
Organization: The Noiad usually saw one another
when they came to witness the Northern Lights (this
also gave them the opportunity to make sure the gods
were all telling them the same things). The Noiad also
used animals, either ghouls or those controlled by the
Animalism Discipline, to keep in some kind of contact.

The View From Without
High Clans: They know more of the truth than
they realize. I have no doubt that God speaks to
them in the lights at the end of the world. I just
doubt they truly hear Him.
Low Clans: The wolf that hides in the flock must
remember that it is not, itself, a sheep.

Quote: We are the children of Midnight Sun. We have a family. We have
what you never could. And you want to tear it all down, don’t you?

Variations of the
Blood

Ravnos Developments

The rest of this chapter deals with minor bloodlines
and other variations on the Clans. For the most part,
these are offshoots of the main Clans that differ only in
outlook or culture. In other cases, some game mechanics (generally weakness or Clan Disciplines) change.
These subtle differences might not be visible to outside
observers, but they are part of what makes Kindred society so diverse, and so confusing.
The first group are the antitribu of the Sabbat, followed by other bloodlines in the modern nights, as well
as some who have come and gone.

Canonical Changes
Two Clans were heavily impacted in some of
the edition changes during Vampire’s history.
Assamite Developments
In the Vampire continuity, the Assamites
managed to break the Tremere ritual that
forced them to abstain from Kindred vitae. If
the Storyteller chooses to exercise this option,
the Assamites revert to their ancient weakness, which is an addiction to Kindred blood.
In this case, when an Assamite so much as
tastes Kindred vitae, the player must make a
Self-Control or Instincts roll (difficulty equal
to the number of blood points ingested +3).
If this roll fails, the addiction rises to the fore,
and she must make another Self-Control
or Instincts roll the next time she comes in
contact with Kindred vitae. If this roll fails,
the Assamite frenzies, doing whatever she can
to partake of more vampiric blood.
In the same continuity, a faction of Assamites
has recently made a formal effort to bring the
Clan under the auspices of the Camarilla,
for both protection and opportunity (and to
replace the Gangrel Clan, who has just left
the Sect).

At the Storyteller’s option, she may choose to
set the chronicle after an event known as the
Week of Nightmares. If this is the case, the
Ravnos are broken, having lost their Antediluvian in a false start to the End Times,
when some of the most powerful supernatural
entities in the world collaborated, in fragile
detente, to bring down the threat of the ancient blood-god.
This option has no mechanical effect on
Ravnos vampires. In the setting however, the
Ravnos briefly went mad in the wake of their
progenitor’s destruction, and underwent a period of cannibalism and frenzy that left their
numbers a paltry fraction of their previous
status as they tore each other apart.
Other Developments
There are a number of other developments of
note, such as the Gangrel leaving the Camarilla and the Malkavians of the Camarilla
having Dominate instead of Dementation as
an in-Clan Discipline. Whichever of these
elements you decide to use are up to you as
Storyteller.

Sabbat Antitribu
Assamite Antitribu
When the Tremere of the Camarilla subjected Clan
Assamite to their curse, rendering Kindred blood a
deadly poison to the Clan of Assassins, not every member of that Clan succumbed. Some broke away from the
main body of the Clan, willing to face whatever doom
awaited rather than submit to the infidel’s magic. The
result was the Assamite antitribu.
These vampires are Cainites in a more direct sense
than many Sabbat. They regard Haqim as an abomination, just one of the hated Antediluvians. Instead, they
revere Caine, and work to become closer to the Third
Mortal. Their method, of course, is to lower their Generation through diablerie.
Beyond that, though, no much differentiates the Angels of Caine from the “mainstream” Assamites. Both

428

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

are masters of hunting and killing, and both observe
strict codes of honor and fierce zeal where their ongoing crusade is concerned. Both grow darker of skin as
they grown older and more powerful. And both forms
of Assamite believe that in the Final Nights, the truly
reverent and devout shall be rewarded, while the weak
perish at their fangs.
Nickname: Angels of Caine
Disciplines: Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus
Weakness: Assamite antitribu have the post-curse
weakness mentioned in the sidebar on the previous
page. In fact, their weakness never changed, while
the rest of the Clan shackled with the blood curse of
the Tremere. Whenever an Assamite antitribu drinks
vampire blood, the player must roll Self-Control or Instincts (difficulty 3 + the number of blood points consumed). If this roll fails, the character is addicted.
Once addicted, the character will indulge in drinking Kindred blood whenever possible. When she is
given the opportunity to do so, the player must roll
Self-Control or Instincts (difficulty 6). If this roll fails,
the character frenzies, attacks the target and drinks as
much blood as she can.
Quote: What gives me the right to take your blood? Oh,
I don’t have a “right.” I have a duty.

Brujah Antitribu
The Brujah antitribu are, perhaps, the historical
founders of the Sabbat. It was the young members of
Clan Brujah, after all, who broke with their elders during the Anarch Revolt, and it was these same volatile
Kindred that fought against the agents of those elders
when other vampires might have considered compromise.
Brujah antitribu are just as unstable and angry as their
Camarilla counterparts, but unlike the Rabble, they
don’t have to pretend to be in control. When a Brujah
antitribu wants something — blood, money, property,
or a new childe — he takes it. This attitude has led
to the bloodline being one of the most numerous in
the Sabbat, and one that supports the Sect with fervor. They turn their infamously violent passion toward
every cause that the Sabbat puts forth. While they traditionally don’t assume leadership roles, when they do
undertake their own missions, they execute them with
brutal and ostentatious abandon.
The Brutes take pains to make others uncomfortable.
Whether that’s by their manner of dress, their barely
concealed appetite for blood, or simply that they sel-

dom retract their fangs even around mortals, the bloodline does what it can to stand out. That might mean a
breach of the Masquerade, of course, but the Brujah
antitribu reason that they are the Damned — so why
shouldn’t they raise a little hell?
Nickname: Brutes
Disciplines: Celerity, Potence, Presence
Weakness: The bloodline has the same weakness as
the main body of the Clan (p. 51): All frenzy difficulties are increased by two, to a maximum of 10. Unlike
Camarilla Brujah, though, the Brutes aren’t in the least
bit sensitive about their tempers. Indeed, they revel in
their rage.
Quote: Heads, we kill everybody here. Tails, we only
kill the ones that stay after I tear that faggot’s ears off.

City Gangrel
The Sabbat boasts two Gangrel lines, the City and
the Country Gangrel. The City Gangrel remind some
Kindred of coyotes — they are creatures well-suited for
wilderness life, but they adapt to an urban existence
quite smoothly. The high preponderance of prey in the
cities, coupled with the Gangrel’s inherent mutability
of blood, has allowed the line to flourish. Their association with the Sabbat means that they Embrace prolifically, but also that their unlife expectancy is short.
Unlike Country Gangrel, who can afford to let their
animalistic ways take over and their appearances grow
truly bestial, the City Gangrel must either adopt a more
Nosferatu-like approach to unlife or blend in with
their prey. To outward appearance, then, these latter
Kindred seem human, dress as appropriate to their area
and the social class that they mimic. But City Gangrel
are largely Sabbat vampires, and that means they are
predators. Any disguise they adopt is strictly that, camouflage to allow them to get close enough to bite.
Nickname: Coyotes
Disciplines: Celerity, Obfuscate, Protean
Weakness: City Gangrel suffer the same weakness
as the main line of the Clan (p. 55). Whenever a City
Gangrel frenzies, he gains a temporary animalistic
feature of some kind (which may replace an existing
temporary one). The mechanical impact of such a feature is up to Storyteller discretion. City Gangrel tend
to develop features reminiscent of the animals commonly found in urban environments — rats, dogs, cats,
pigeons, and even insects.
Quote: The new community center is finally open. Call
up the pack.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

429

Country Gangrel
The Country Gangrel resemble the independent and
Camarilla Gangrel — they are savage, vicious hunters,
more comfortable in the wilds between cities than the
concrete jungles. The Sabbat has seen a influx of Gangrel converts from the Camarilla, and these Hunters
easily lost themselves in stalking and killing.
The Country Gangrel serve the Sabbat as assassins
and scouts, using their command of animals to gather
intelligence on the comings and goings of other Kindred. Travel between cities was never exactly safe, as
Lupines seem to prowl any patch of land large enough
to grow a few trees (or so Camarilla elders have always
told their childer), but with the Hunters prowling
about, looking for wayward neonates, itinerant Kindred face even more dire threats.
This might sound like Camarilla propaganda, but the
Country Gangrel do all they can to make it true. Free
from the constraints of having to look human, these
creatures relish the chance to hunt as wolves hunt —
savagely and in packs. If they have a regret, it’s that
their prey can’t usually run fast enough to make the
hunt last.
Nickname: Hunters
Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean
Weakness: The Hunters have the same weakness
as their non-Sabbat counterparts (p. 55). Each time
a Country Gangrel frenzies, he gains a temporary animalistic feature, which may replace an existing temporary one. The mechanical impact of such a feature is up
to Storyteller discretion.
Quote: Lost? Bad place for lost. Wanna run now?

Malkavian Antitribu
The Malkavians are insane. It is their defining feature, and while not every Lunatic is dangerous, they
are all unstable and unpredictable. And so the Malkavians of the Sabbat, the vampires of the Camarilla
suspect, must be even crazier. They are quite correct.
Malkavian antitribu are just as varied in dementia as
their Camarilla brethren, but their madness carries with
it a desperate, cloying edge. They are not satisfied with
setting others on edge or forcing the “sane” vampires
to challenge their own philosophies. They want — inasmuch as they can be said to collectively want anything — for the world to share their madness. Maybe
they feel that their madness is overflowing, forcing its
way from their minds into the minds of others through
their Dementation Discipline. Whatever the case, the

430

Clan at large — even outside the Sabbat — seems to
have heard the message.
Within the Sabbat, the Freaks take on roles appropriate to their madness. The truly vicious and uncontrollable ones are locked away in crypts and unleashed
when the Sabbat needs shock and awe. The more functional Freaks lead war parties, perform ritae, or divine
the future of the Sect from the entrails of their victims
(often while those victims look on in horror). No matter what their role, though, the underlying goal of the
Malkavian antitribu seems to be to bestow the gift of
madness upon everyone around them.
Nickname: Freaks
Disciplines: Auspex, Dementation, Obfuscate
Weakness: Like all Malkavians (p. 61), the Freaks
are completely insane. At character creation, the player must choose a derangement that the character can
never overcome.
Quote: Consult the haruspex once again. Always learn
the same lesson. Follow the tract, and it ends in the same
place. We’re there, boys. We’re in the shit.

Nosferatu Antitribu
The Nosferatu of the Sabbat aren’t too different from
their Camarilla brethren. Both branches of the Clan
tend toward subterranean havens, and both branches
use their considerable skill in stealth and control of
vermin to traffic in information. Just as the more beautiful Kindred of the Camarilla must occasionally get
their feet dirty going to see a Nosferatu information
broker, the Cainites call upon their deformed comrades for secrets and tactics.
Interestingly, the Nosferatu antitribu are less brutal
than many Sabbat Kindred. This may be because they
know what it is to be a monster — it’s there, in their
faces, from the first night of undeath. They don’t need
to overcompensate, and so bloody excesses are unnecessary. This by no means makes the Creeps human, or
even especially humane. It just means that if a Nosferatu antitribu does engage in wholesale slaughter or horrific violence, he’s doing it for a specific reason, rather
than just for fun.
But the Creeps may have another reason for avoiding overt depravity — they wish to stay as far under
the radar as possible. While the Nosferatu antitribu are
careful to avoid letting Clan business get out into the
rumor mill, gossip occasionally surfaces that the Clan
is terrified of its Antediluvian founder, more so than
other Clans of the Sabbat.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Nickname: Creeps
Disciplines: Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence
Weakness: Sabbat Nosferatu are just as hideous as
their Camarilla counterparts, and suffer the same weakness (p. 63): they all have an Appearance score of zero,
and they may never improve it
Quote: There’s always a scarier beastie. Look: You’re
scarier than Dahmer or Gacy. I’m scarier than you.
And… well. There are things scarier than me. Let’s leave
it at that.

Panders
The Caitiff of the Sabbat, Panders are on the front
lines when the Sword of Caine goes to war. That means,
of course, that the vast majority of casualties in violent
action come from their ranks. But as precarious as this
position within the Sabbat may be, it is their position,
and the rest of the Sect recognizes this. Recognition, as
any Caitiff trying desperately to survive under a Camarilla Prince will tell you, goes a long way.
Any Sabbat vampire that does not know his Clan,
or any vampire Embraced by an established Pander, is
considered a Mutt. This means that when the Sabbat
goes looking for shock troops, it tends to be Panders
that swell their ranks (since mass Embrace definitely
qualifies as dangerous work). The Panders became an
established part of the Sabbat in the 1950s, when a
low-level Sabbat vampire named Joseph Pander united the Clanless Sabbat under his banner (and name).
Ever since then, the term has been applied to these
Kindred. They take on the dress and mannerisms of
bikers, homeless, punks, and the dispossessed among
humanity, the better to feed on and Embrace from
these dregs. But rare is the Pander that bemoans his lot
in unlife — these Cainites are true, loyal Sabbat.
Nickname: Mutts
Disciplines: Panders do not have Clan Disciplines,
meaning that the player may choose any Discipline at
character creation (subject to Storyteller approval). In
addition, Panders are subject to the same rules for raising Disciplines with experience points as Caitiff (see
p. 124).
Weakness: Panders do not have a specific weakness. Pander characters cannot start lower than Ninth
Generation, though they can subsequently lower their
Generation via diablerie.
Quote: Call me a Mutt, yeah? That’s fine. Purebreds go
crazy as they get older. And Cainites, well, we live “dog
eat dog.”

Ravnos Antitribu
Shortly after the formation of the Sabbat, a small
group of Ravnos decided that following the orders of
their elders and searching for the same “truths” the
Clan always had wasn’t what they wanted out of unlife. They wanted the freedom that the Sabbat promised, and so they renounced their heritage and became
part of the Sword of Caine. From there, they Embraced
just as any Sabbat vampires did, and so the Ravnos antitribu are still an important part of the Sabbat. The
Rogues lurk amongst the nomadic Sabbat packs, acting
as scouts and con artists.
The Ravnos antitribu may be thieves and liars, but
if one gives his solemn word (accompanied by spitting blood into his hand), he will keep that vow even
unto Final Death. They share their Clan’s propensity
for vice, and for nomadic unlife. The freedom to pull
up stakes and leave an area whenever trouble comes
knocking — combined with the freedom to feed as
they please — makes the Sabbat the only conceivable
way of unlife for these Cainites.
Nickname: Rogues
Disciplines: Animalism, Chimerstry, Fortitude
Weakness: Each Ravnos antitribu, just like their parent Clan (p. 65), has a penchant for some sort of vice
— breaking taboos is hard-wired into the Rogues just
as it is into the Ravnos proper. When presented with
the opportunity to engage in that vice, the Rogue must
indulge it unless her player succeeds on a Self-Control
or Instincts roll (difficulty 6).
Quote: Freedom means not giving a fuck about marime.

Salubri Antitribu
The Salubri of the Sabbat are not the quiet, contemplative Kindred that seek Golconda in persecuted
exile. No, these Kindred call themselves “Furies,” and
they seek the blood of the Camarilla vampires —
the Tremere especially — with a venomous passion.
In nights past, as mentioned in the Salubri spread
(p. 408), the Clan contained both healers and warriors.
And now, in the modern nights, the warriors have reemerged — and stand to be counted with the Sabbat.
The Salubri antitribu are devoted to the cause of killing Camarilla vampires, but not necessarily to other
Sabbat agendas. They take part in the ritae of the Sect,
and they share their blood, but what truly fires them up
is the chance to invade Camarilla territory and burn
some Tremere. If the ancient rumors of the Salubri

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

431

warriors being honorable knights are true, then times
have indeed changed. These Kindred do not know
“honorable combat” from “IED.” They just want to
watch their enemies crumble to dust.
Nickname: Furies
Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Valeren
Weakness: Unlike their nonviolent brethren, Sabbat Salubri must consume blood taken by force, preferably in the heat of battle. Unless the vampire feeds
on blood from a fallen foe or fights his target before
feeding, the Vitae offers no nourishment. In addition,
Salubri antitribu cannot start lower than Tenth Generation or higher than Twelfth, as their blood has yet
to spread across a wider spectrum than that.
Quote: I’d wear your skin, but I don’t want to smell like
fear and gasoline.

Serpents of the Light
The Serpents of the Light are the antitribu of the Followers of Set. They began as a splinter group, a Setite
heresy that rejected the worship of the Clan’s founder as a god. This Sect made its way to Haiti, studying vodoun and the mysticism thereof, and during the
1970s came under the sway of the Sabbat. The Clan
proper tried to bring the Serpents of the Light back
in line with “orthodox” Setite belief, but to no avail.
As with several other splinter groups of the Clans, the
Serpents of the Light found the freedom of the Sword
of Caine too alluring.
The bloodline’s methods are familiar to those who
know the Setites. The Cobras engage in seduction and
sexual manipulation in order to achieve their ends (and,
of course, to find the blood they need to survive). They
dabble in drugs, prostitution, and any other method
they can find to bring mortals into slavery to their own
vices. In fact, apart from religious outlook, very little
separates them from the Followers of Set. Some Kindred wonder, in fact, if the whole schism isn’t part of
some much longer and intricate scheme, one that only
the eldest of the line are fully privy to.
Nickname: Cobras
Disciplines: Presence, Obfuscate, Serpentis
Weakness: The Serpents of the Light, despite the
name, are just as vulnerable to bright illumination as
their parent Clan (p. 53). They suffer two additional
health levels of damage from sunlight, and a one-die
penalty to all rolls when subject to bright light of any
kind.

432

Quote: Let’s dance, you and I. No one watching but
the loa. And hell, let’s invite them to join us. Roll up your
sleeve.

Toreador Antitribu
The Toreador of the Sabbat are just as prone to creative expression and love of beauty as their Camarilla
counterparts, but they enjoy a much higher regard
within their Sect. This is because the Toreador antitribu codified much of the Sabbat’s present structure,
forming its rites and expressing its philosophy in such
as a way as to appeal to the young vampires of the time.
They layered discourse with meaning, showing through
satire, poetry, and (when necessary) straightforward
explanation that the Sabbat held the keys to the future
of all Cainites.
These vampires haven’t lost their creative edge over
the centuries. While Camarilla Toreador express themselves through fairly conventional means of art, the
Perverts tend more toward extreme, bloody, and painful presentations. Torture is an art form, and body art
— whether performed with tattoo needles or scalpels
— is popular among the Perverts. Since such modifications are not permanent (unless the Pervert in question
is able to learn Vicissitude, that is), the undead form is
a constantly renewing canvas. The Toreador antitribu
take advantage of this to send messages coded within
the art of their own bodies, using a system of symbols
that takes the vampires a lifetime to truly master.
Nickname: Perverts or Pervs
Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Presence
Weakness: Over time, the propensity for the Toreador to become fascinated by beauty has twisted itself
into a perverse need for cruelty. When faced with an
opportunity to inflict emotional or physical pain — a
captive that might be tortured, or a protégé whose ambitions might be squashed — the Toreador antitribu’s
player must make a Self-Control or Instinct roll (difficulty 6), or spend a Willpower point. If the roll fails,
the character must indulge in her savage desires.
Quote: Hold that pose. That’s good. Can you stop
bleeding from the neck so much, please?

Tremere Antitribu
Centuries ago, a small group of Tremere, fearful that
the Sabbat would destroy the Camarilla and their Clan
in the process, defected to the smaller Sect. They offered their skills as thaumaturgists to the Sword of
Caine, in exchange for safety from their former Clan.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

The Sabbat, not able to turn down the benefits of blood
magic (despite how much the Tzimisce objected), took
them in.
Reaction from Clan Tremere was swift, of course.
The Warlocks conjured a curse that branded every
Tremere antitribu with a mark, one that only “true”
Tremere could see. Unable to hide what they were, the
Tremere antitribu stayed in chantries, providing support and knowledge to their comrades.
This state of affairs continued for centuries. The
Tremere antitribu contributed much to the Sabbat.
They worked with the Tzimisce to create the Blood
Brothers, they prevented the Camarilla Tremere from
destroying the Sect from afar, and, of course, they tutored other Sabbat Cainites in blood magic. And then
one horrible night, they all died, burning to death in
a mysterious conflagration that afflicted each and every Tremere subject to the traitor’s mark. Interestingly,
those few Sabbat Tremere who had defected from the
Sabbat to the Camarilla were not destroyed, which
might shed some light on the massacre’s origins.
Nickname: Spellbinders
Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy
Weakness: The Tremere antitribu were all immediately recognizable as traitors to Camarilla Warlocks.
The mark wasn’t a physical disfigurement, but a change
to the character’s very presence. This wasn’t a weakness that carries an immediate mechanical disadvantage, but once identified, the Tremere antitribu could
expect to be hunted down and burned as soon as the
Tremere can possibly manage it. They were also still
susceptible to the power of the blood, gaining a +1 to
all Vinculum rolls.
In addition, Tremere antitribu were barred from taking leadership roles in the Sabbat.
Quote: It’s always been inevitable. That’s why we joined
up in the first place.

Ventrue Antitribu
The Ventrue pretend to nobility, but they are nothing
more than the ruling class of the dying world — merchants and moneylenders. Clan Ventrue has a glorious
past, a lineage of knights, paladins, and warrior-kings.
The Blue Bloods of tonight relish backroom dealings,
compromise and favor-trading. In other words, say the
Ventrue antitribu, they are no better than the sniveling
Tremere.
The Ventrue antitribu might not be the moral backbone of the Sabbat, but they are definitely some of the

most idealist Cainites therein (although there are rumors that there may be two distinct bloodlines both
claiming to be the “true” Ventrue antitribu). They carry
with them the notions of noblesse oblige and chivalry.
They believe that their Camarilla counterparts have
betrayed not only the true nature of the vampiric race,
but the role of their Clan in particular and feel that
only by taking up the mantle of Warriors of Caine can
they atone. When Gehenna comes and the skies rain
fire and blood, it will not be the Crusaders that hide
in their havens and pray that doom passes them by.
These devout Kindred will be at the forefront, swords
— or machine guns — hoisted high and the ancient
motto of their Clan proudly on their lips: Regere sanguine, regere in veritatem est (“To rule in blood is to rule
in truth”).
Nickname: Crusaders
Disciplines: Dominate, Fortitude, Auspex or Presence
Weakness: Sabbat Ventrue have the same weakness
as their Camarilla brethren (see p. 73). The player decides with the Storyteller what specific type of blood
suits the Crusader, and this choice is permanent. Blood
of other types (even animals) simply offers the vampire
no blood pool increase, no matter how much he consumes
Quote: You’re not worthy of the blood you’re carrying.
Time to give it to a real child of Veddartha.

Other Bloodlines
Assamites
Assamite Sorcerers
Outsiders to Clan Assamite don’t see the caste divisions clearly, but the Saracens have a history of blood
magic that predates that of the Tremere. Assamite
sorcerers began in the Second City, conscripted or
lured into the Clan with the promise of immortality
in which to perfect their magic. They were tasked with
providing magical support, and for centuries, they were
simply one caste of the Assamite Clan.
And then came the Tremere. The Assamite sorcerers found themselves facing foes as magically tenacious
as they were, foes that were quite happy to steal their
knowledge. The sorcerers fought against this new menace as best they could, but then the Tremere levied
their blood curse on the line. The sorcerers became ob-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

433

sessed with finding a cure, an obsession which remains
tonight.
Nickname: Magi (singular, “Magus”)
Disciplines: Assamite Sorcery, Obfuscate, Quietus
Weakness: The line as a whole has practiced the art
for so long that it permeates their blood, making each
individual sorcerer stand out like a beacon to anyone
with supernatural perception. Any use of a supernatural power on a sorcerer for purposes of perception enjoys a -2 difficulty. Additionally, attempts to penetrate
a sorcerer’s supernatural concealment using an opposed
power are considered to operate one level higher than
normal (so a character with Auspex 2 trying to penetrate a sorcerer’s Obfuscate has an effective Auspex
of 3).
Quote: We were calling down gentle rain and terrible
storms when your people were still making crude charcoal
marks on cave walls. Don’t presume to know us.

Assamite Viziers
Assamite viziers are and always have been a vital part
of the Clan. Magical knowledge and research remains
the purview of the sorcerers, but the viziers are necessary for compiling and uncovering information on
philosophy, government, the arts, and religion. The
viziers have acted as leaders within the Clan — not
where matters of war are concerned (this they wisely
leave to the warrior Assamites), but when it comes to
understanding and relating to mortals, the viziers make
the best consultants.
Unfortunately, while they can learn, understand,
and interpret mortal customs and mores, they have difficulty actually relating to them. Assamite viziers are
driven to accumulate knowledge with a zeal that borders on obsessive. They can understand why people act
the way they do on a large scale, but understanding the
motives of a particular person is much more difficult.
For many years, Assamite viziers and sorcerers were
regarded as one caste (this is why sorcerers are still referred to as “viziers” by the ignorant). In modern nights,
the viziers have emerged from the shadows to conduct
their scholarly research more visibly. Whether this will
open the viziers to greater danger from the Assamites’
enemies or bring the caste more power remains to be
seen.
Nickname: Scholars or Artisans
Disciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Quietus

434

Weakness: The viziers are mad. Every vizier finds
himself caught up in the continuance of his chosen
pursuits to the exclusion of trivial concerns such as
daily shelter or nightly nourishment. Each vizier has
an Obsessive-Compulsive derangement (p. 292) associated with his highest-rated intellectual or creative
Ability. If the character’s focus of effort shifts, so does
the focus of the derangement.
Quote: Seventy virgins. Seventy Kindred in the city.
Virgin blood — have any of the Kindred in the city consumed the blood of their own childer? Well, find out!

Followers of Set
Daitya
The Daitya are an Indian bloodline of the Followers
of Set. They revere Shiva the Destroyer as an incarnation of Set, and believe that by casting the world into
greater depths of depravity, they can help it reach its
nadir of true evil. When that happens, Shiva will open
his third eye and gaze upon the world, destroying it,
and setting the stage for the next cycle of existence.
Like many Indian Kindred, the Daitya do not accept
the Caine myth. They believe that they are demons,
and that by killing, corrupting, and enslaving people,
they are doing what it is in their nature as demons to
do. They observe a caste system similar to that of mortals, and feel that being Embraced indicates a previous
life of sin and profanity. By doing their duty in this
incarnation (which can last many lifetimes), then the
Daitya feel that reincarnation in a higher station is
possible.
Many Daitya run or are involved with a cult to Shiva, and recruit ghouls and childer from the cult. The
bloodline is scholarly and devout, in its way. The Daitya are not, however, humble — they believe that the
gods themselves listen to their prayers, and that they
are the vehicles that will bring the world to judgment.
Nickname: Blasphemers
Disciplines: Presence, Obfuscate, Serpentis
Weakness: The Daitya suffer the same weakness as
the Followers of Set (p. 53): They suffer two additional
health levels of damage from sunlight, and a one-die
penalty to all rolls when subject to bright light of any
kind.
Quote: Tonight we fast. Keep your hunger under control. Kill the mortal whelp if you wish, if it helps, but do
not feed.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Tlacique
When the Spanish came to what is now Mexico,
they carried Kindred with them in the holds of their
ships. These undead stepped into the nights of the
New World… and found that other vampires already
claimed domain here. One bloodline of such Kindred
was the Tlacique.
Claiming descent from Tezcatlipoca, the Aztec god
of night and black magic, the Tlacique might have
forged alliances with the Kindred that arrived with
the Spaniards, had those conquistadores not destroyed
the civilizations on which the Tlacique preyed and infected their people with smallpox. As their society fell,
the Tlacique briefly allied with the Sabbat, but when
the two factions took the time to examine the others,
they found their belief systems quite incompatible. The
Sword of Caine eventually slew the weakened Tlacique, and the bloodline as a whole vanished from view.
They still exist, however: a handful scattered across
Central America and the southwestern United States.
The Tlacique are unquestionably a Setite line,
though only their vulnerability to sunlight marks them
as such. They are mystics one and all, and status within
the line depends in part by learning magic. In addition to their Disciplines, they practice a form of Thaumaturgy called Nahuallotl (in game terms, this Path is
identical to the Path of Blood, found on p. 213, although they pay out-of-Clan costs to learn it).
Nickname: Jaguars
Disciplines: Obfuscate, Presence, Protean
Weakness: The Tlacique’s weakness is one of the
only ways to trace the line’s lineage to the Setites.
They, like the Followers of Set (p. 53), suffer two additional health levels of damage from sunlight, and a
one-die penalty to all rolls when subjected to bright
light of any kind.
Quote: A heart to make the sun rise. The blood within
the heart to sustain the sun through his nightly sleep. You
are blessed — you get to provide both.

Warrior Setites
Not all Followers of Set are subtle, forked-tongued
seducers. A number of them prefer to walk a more
martial path, becoming holy warriors for their god.
The warrior Setites eschew the Obfuscate Discipline
for Potence — no slinking in the dark for these serpents. They are proud and brutal soldiers for Set, and
are perfectly willing to go into battle to back up their
subtler brethren. They act as enforcers, assassins, and

even martyrs for the rest of the line, although thinking of them as mindless brutes is a mistake. A warrior
Setite is still very much a Setite, and quite capable of
leading others into all sorts of temptation. They just
have the strength to make their points forcefully when
necessary.
The warrior Setite line is interesting in that it is not
passed down by the Embrace. A mortal Embraced by a
warrior Setite becomes a “normal” member of the line
(that is, learning Obfuscate as a Clan Discipline) unless trained as a warrior from childe-hood. The line is
therefore an example of how training and ideology can
change the basic makeup of a vampire’s Clan.
Warrior Setites generally embrace passionate ideologues. The ideology that they espouse isn’t important.
A fanatical Christian’s fervor can be turned to Set as
easily as the zeal of a pro-union rabble rouser, given the
right amount of Kindred vitae and religious revelations
from Set.
Nickname: Horned Vipers
Disciplines: Potence, Presence, Serpentis
Weakness: The warriors suffer same weakness as the
Followers of Set (p. 53): They suffer two additional
health levels of damage from sunlight, and a one-die
penalty to all rolls when subjected to bright light of
any kind.
Quote: The Serpent of Eden had his approach. Mine is
more honest — that should be refreshing for you.

Gangrel
Mariners
The Mariners are Gangrel who have chosen to dwell
full-time in the ocean. Gangrel aquarii (as they are
sometimes known to scholarly Kindred) swim below
the sunlit zone, their Fortitude Discipline keeping
them safe from the pressure that would otherwise crush
them. They ascend at night to feed, usually on sharks
and whales, but they aren’t choosy — anything with
blood is fair game. A shipwreck is a smorgasbord for
the Mariners, and a large enough disaster is one of the
few events that might draw more than one to the same
region.
Mariners sometimes act in defense of the oceans,
sneaking aboard polluting vessels and killing everyone
aboard. One some level this makes sense — if their
prey dies off, they’ll have to return to the land (or quest
ever further into the Deeps).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

435

The Camarilla and the Sabbat have, on the rare occasions they find them, offered Mariners membership.
The Mariners decline. They have no sectarian interests, and escaping the Jyhad might have been why the
first Mariner left the land to begin with. No one knows
how long ago that was, but most of the Mariners are of
low Generation, and some of them date to the Age of
Exploration.
Nickname: None (the few Kindred that know of
them simply call them “Mariners” or “aquatic Gangrel”)
Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean
Weakness: As with most Gangrel (p. 55), the Mariners gain an animalistic feature each time they frenzy.
These features, though, resemble fish, aquatic worms,
cephalopods, and other sea creatures (the rare Gangrel
develops a cetacean or seal-like feature). The alien
nature of these features should be taken into consideration by Storytellers determining the mechanical
impact of such features.
Quote: Why did I leave the land? Because in the sea, the
sharks just swim up and bite you. They don’t smile first.

Lasombra
Angellis Ater
The Angellis Ater are an odd bloodline, one that
crosses boundaries between Baali and Lasombra. The
so-called “black angels” believe that vampires are the
instrument of Satan, and they worship sin and the darkness of the soul. Their Lasombra blood lets them reach
into the blackness, pull it forth and manipulate it, and
the black angels become dependent upon and addicted
to use of the Obtenebration Discipline over time.
The bloodline has been around since at least the
Middle Ages, descended in part from a powerful Baali
called Azaneal. This monstrous vampire acted as a
leader within the Baali line for a time, and twisted the
orthodoxy of some Kindred enough to create a kind of
heresy, one that was all too attractive to the Lasombra. The Clan of Shadows’ power base traditionally
included the Catholic Church, and over time the Angellis Ater made at least some inroad with these pious
(or pious-seeming) Lasombra. How much influence in
the Church they were able to wield is not known, but
they did survive the Inquisition. Angellis Ater are rare
in modern nights, but they do exist.
Nickname: Black Angels

436

Disciplines: Daimoinon, Dominate, and one of Potence, Presence, or Obfuscate
Weakness: The Angellis Ater have the same weakness as other Lasombra (p. 59) — they do not cast reflections.
Quote: We reach into the shadows, reach into hell. We
pull out what you find there, and paint the world with it.

Lasombra Antitribu
Lasombra antitribu are simply members of Clan Lasombra who either predate the Sabbat and refused to
join, or who disagree with the Sabbat’s philosophies.
They are rare in either case, because the Sabbat goes
out of its way to destroy them, but a few persist. Some
join the Camarilla, while others remain independent.
As a rule, they carry the Machiavellian attitude that
typifies the Lasombra — they fully expect that they
will win the Jyhad, and they are willing to do what is
necessary to do so. They just feel that their Clan as a
whole made the wrong choice.
While some Camarilla vampires know that these
Kindred exist, at least in theory, the Magisters themselves try to stay out of the spotlight. The Sabbat has
been known to stage raids on Camarilla cities, raids that
they cannot hope to bring to a victory, just to destroy
a Lasombra antitribu. Some Kindred put this down to
the tenacity and spite of the Sabbat, but others point
out that it tends to be the Sabbat Lasombra — well
known for being good tacticians — who initiate these
raids. What are they so afraid that the Lasombra antitribu might reveal?
Nickname: Magisters (this was the Clan’s sobriquet
for centuries before the Anarch Revolt)
Disciplines: Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence
Weakness: In addition to the Clan’s usual problem
with reflections (p. 59), Lasombra antitribu also have
the “weakness” of being hunted relentlessly by the Sabbat, and targeted for destruction whenever their existence is made public.
Quote: I watched the fires of the Reconquista. I saw the
trenches of the Great War and the fires that burned Dresden. The so-called “Sword of Caine” does not fill me with
dread.

Malkavians
Dominate Malkavians
For the most part, other Kindred don’t differentiate
between Dominate Malkavians and the main body of

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

the Clan. Vampires don’t carry badges detailing their
acuity in the various Disciplines, after all, and it’s by no
means impossible for a Malkavian to wield both powers. As with so many things related to the Moon Clan,
most vampires wouldn’t know about it if the Malkavians didn’t tell them.
For some reason, the Clan felt it was important for
the Camarilla to know that some of their number retained skill with the Dominate Discipline. Likewise,
their nickname — Carriers — is self-applied. The implication is clear: These Malkavians are immune to
Dementation (at least as far as “contracting” it the way
the rest of the Clan did), but they are capable of spreading it. Rumors fly that these Malkavians are capable
of spreading Dementation — and the accompanying
madness — even to non-Malkavian Kindred.
Whether or not that’s true hasn’t been established,
but it is true that Dominate Malkavians tend to be
more outwardly stable than other members of their
Clan. That isn’t to say they aren’t mad — they are.
Their derangements, though, tend more toward cold
sociopathy or quiet hallucinations that the screaming,
full-blown madness that afflicts much of the rest of the
Clan. Likewise, Dominate Malkavians show no particular propensity for prophetic wisdom, and often seem
somewhat contemptuous of the ones that do.
Nickname: Carriers
Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Obfuscate (Note: If
you wish to set your Vampire game before the events
of the “Great Prank” that gave every Malkavian Dementation, nearly every Lunatic has these Disciplines
– only the Malkavian antitribu at the time have access
to Dementation.)
Weakness: Like all Malkavians (p. 61), the Carriers
are irretrievably insane. As a rule, their insanity tends
to be “quieter” than the average Lunatic’s, but the
Dominate Malkavians still have at least one derangement that cannot be cured.
Quote: If you’re expecting me to flip out and start hitting
people with fish, well, you’ve got the wrong weirdo. I’m not
here to amuse you.

Ravnos
Brahman
The elders of Clan Ravnos long ago divided themselves up into castes, much like mortal Indian society.
In theory, only a member of a given vampire caste could
Embrace a member of the appropriate mortal caste. In

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

437

practice, though, the Clan’s elders couldn’t maintain
such strict control over its members, even in India, and
certainly not in the rest of the world.

survives in modern nights — rare and quiet, but present.

For the most part, these vampire castes (called jati)
were identical to the main body of the Clan in terms of
ability and blood. The Brahman Ravnos, though, have
a gift of sight that the other jati do not, and often use it
to divine the future or the locations of their enemies.
They act as advisors and seers to their Clan in India.

Disciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Obeah or Valeren
(player’s choice at character creation)

Another branch of the Clan, called the Phuri Dae,
followed the Roma (Gypsies) along their travels in Europe. They are mechanically identical to the Brahman,
and served much the same function.
Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Chimerstry
Weakness: The Brahman suffer the same weakness
as the main body of Clan Ravnos (p. 65). Each one has
a preferred form of vice (though the Brahman have a
special love for swindling through psychic readings and
séances). Whenever the Brahman is given the chance
to indulge in his favorite vice, the player must roll SelfControl or Instinct (difficulty 6) to resist the temptation.
Quote: Our traditions are not meaningless now, childe.
If anything, they mean more now. We have so much more
to preserve, and so few voices left to accomplish it.

Salubri
Wu Zao
Saulot left Europe and traveled east, where he met
native creatures that, though they fed on blood, were
not truly Kindred. These “Wan Kuei” called him Zaolat, and regarded him as a trickster, a thief, and a barbarian.
Unwelcome though he was, Zao-lat managed to leave
a legacy behind — the Wu Zao. These Kindred are the
descendants of two vampires Embraced by Zao-lat during his time in the Middle Kingdom (named Zao-zei
and Zao-xue). These two vampires helped Zao-lat uncover the arcane secrets of the East, break into the lairs
of demons, and learn their weaknesses.
But the local vampires eventually drove Zao-lat from
their lands, leaving behind his two childer to carry on
his work. Since then, the Wu Zao have been intrigued
or (more accurately) obsessed by whatever areas of arcane study pique their interests. Their scholarly ways
have served them well — when news of Saulot’s destruction reached them, some few went into hiding
and avoided purges in their own lands. The bloodline

438

Nickname: Orphans

Weakness: The Wu Zao are scholars by nature, and
each of them has a special focus. At character creation,
the player must select an area of arcane study — the
Wan Kuei, the culture of a specific mortal group, a
group of mystical tomes lost to the ages, etc. Whenever
the opportunity arises to learn something about this
subject, the player must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to avoid pursuing that lead to the exclusion
of all else.
Quote: How much? Ha! For that old trinket! Never!
Wait, wait. How much again?

Tremere
Telyavelic Tremere
In the early nights of Clan Tremere, before the diablerie of Saulot, a small band of Warlocks made its way
into Lithuania. Clan records state that the original
goal of this journey was to expand the Clan’s influence
into these lands, or to find allies. Some elder Tremere,
though, claim that these pilgrims took the journey to
escape from the clutches of their Clan once and for
all.
Whatever the original motive behind the exodus,
when the Tremere arrived, they fell in with the pagan
peoples of Lithuania and learned of Telyavel, the protector of the dead. The local people saw the vampires
— nocturnal, bloodthirsty, and obviously magical —
as incarnations or avatars of their death-gods, and the
Tremere grew to believe them. They cast off the name
“Tremere,” and simply became the “Telyavs.” While
they had some infrequent contact with chantries outside of Lithuania, for the most party they remained patrons and predators to the villagers.
This was not to last, however. In the late 13th century, the Ventrue warlord Jürgen the Sword-Bearer
destroyed one of the last remaining enclaves of the
Telyavs. The bloodline managed to limp along for another few centuries, but by the 16th century, the main
body of the Tremere reported that all of them had been
destroyed.
Nickname: Telyavs, Shepherds
Disciplines: Auspex, Presence, Thaumaturgy

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Weakness: The Telyavs bound their fates so tightly
to their pagan herds that they took on some of the same
fears and enemies. They are weak against Christian
symbols and faith. Difficulties to resist frenzy are two
higher than normal when confronted by an enemy using True Faith as a defense. They recoil from the sight
of the cross or other symbols of the Christian faith.
Quote: We reached too high. Power and enlightenment
aren’t found in formulae. They are found in dirt, wood,
and blood.

Tzimisce

tude (depending on whether the koldun is an Old Clan
Tzimisce or not).
Weakness: As with the rest of the Clan (p. 71): The
koldun must rest in the proximity of at least two handfuls of native soil. Failure to meet this requirement
halves the koldun’s dice pools every 24 hours, until all
pools fall to one die. This penalty remains until they
are able to rest for a full day in their earth.
Quote: I am the land. You have not violated my home…
you have violated me. And now you reap the consequences.

Old Clan Tzimisce

Kolduns
The koldun are the oldest sorcerers among the Kindred, or at least they claim to be. Their magic is ancient, to be sure. This magic does not depend on formulae and lifeless, categorized rotes. Rather, it draws
power from the most unlikely source: the living earth.
Koldunic Sorcery excels in manipulating the natural
elements in subtle and grandiose ways, yet its paths follow no other directions. Many of its rituals build on
spirituality and vitality thought lost to vampires. Kolduns, then, are Tzimisce wizards who are in tune with
the land around them to a frightening degree.
The kolduns aren’t protectors of the land, though,
at least not in the way that the phrase usually implies.
They use the land, drinking in its energy and reshaping it into weapons. They protect the land because it
is theirs, and therefore they display the same territorialism for which the Tzimisce in general are so widely
known.
For many years, Koldunic Sorcery was the province
of a few very powerful elder Tzimisce, almost all Old
Clan (see below). In recent nights, though, the knowledge of the magic has filtered down through the Clan’s
ranks, and even neonates may learn it. This is a huge
departure from previous practices. It remains to be seen
what effect Koldunic Sorcery will have on the world
at large.
Nickname: None
Disciplines: The kolduns aren’t truly a bloodline.
Rather, koldunism is a practice within the Tzimisce
where the vampire learns Koldunic Sorcery (at out-ofClan costs). Koldun Clan Disciplines, therefore, are
Auspex, Animalism, and either Dominate or Vicissi-

The Old Clan Tzimisce are a small group of Fiends
who predate the use of fleshcrafting. They regard Vicissitude as a disease of the soul, and refuse to learn or employ it. In most other respects, though, they resemble
the rest of the Clan. They share the Clan’s propensity
for manners and respect for territory, and as most of
the surviving members of this “bloodline” still reside in
what is now Romania, they govern their territories using Old World methods and customs. In some remote
places, they rule more or less openly, taking blood tithe
from the mortals under their “protection” and keeping out other supernatural threats. As the world grows
smaller through the use of information technology,
though, those nights may be coming to an end.
The Old Clan would prefer never to have to deal
with the “defiled” members of Clan Tzimisce, but family is family and they can’t survive the modern nights
with no support. They make treaties and trade favors
with other Fiends, sometimes lending support to the
Sabbat as a whole in exchange for help and support
when they need. One thing they refuse to do, though,
is share blood with a Sabbat vampire. One never knows
what might be swimming in it.
Nickname: The Old Clan
Disciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Dominate
Weakness: As with the rest of the Clan (p. 71), the
Old Clan Tzimisce must sleep in at least two handfuls of soil from their homeland. Failure to meet this
requirement halves the Tzimisce’s dice pools every 24
hours, until all pools fall to one die. This penalty remains until they are able to rest for a full day in their
earth.
Quote: Old ways do not die. Like old Cainites, they
merely sleep, awaiting sufficient blood to reawaken them.

Disciplines
These are the alphabetized Disciplines for the bloodlines presented in this chapter.

Assamite Sorcery
From a purely functional standpoint, the blood magic
that the Assamite sorcerer caste practices differs little
from that wielded by the Tremere. From a philosophical perspective, however, worlds of difference separate
the two. The Tremere force every piece of knowledge
they incorporate into the structured, rigid framework
of high Hermetic invocation. By contrast, the sorcerer
caste’s practices are the result of millennia of adaptation and melding, and are too disparate to be considered “structured” in any real sense. The modern body
of knowledge that is Assamite Sorcery draws its content from a wide array of magical traditions, from the
ecstatic rites of Kali and Shiva’s followers to the subtle precision of feng shui to the elegant symbolic and
mathematical transformations of Islamic alchemists
and astronomers.
Assamite Sorcery is mechanically identical to the
more common Thaumaturgy that appears on pp. 212240. However, though they work on similar principles
(the use of vampiric vitae to fuel exertions of conscious
will in order to effect change upon the physical or
spiritual world), the two are not cross-compatible. A
Tremere strives to perform his magic the same way, all
the time, every time. An Assamite might never enact
the same ritual the same exact way twice in a millennium.
As may be expected, students of Assamite Sorcery
have great difficulty learning the practices of other
blood magic traditions. All experience points costs to
learn other blood magic paths and rituals are increased
by half (round up) for Assamite sorcerers. In addition,
even once the sorcerer has incorporated these lessons
into her repertoire, they are still alien to her. All invocations of a “foreign” path require one extra blood
point and all rituals take triple the normal time and
require one extra success for any desired result.

Awakening of the Steel
Although combat mastery is hardly the sorcerer
caste’s primary goal, they have a long tradition of
standing ready to defend themselves and, if need be,

440

Equivalent Assamite
Paths and Rituals
The sorcerers have equivalent teachings for
many common blood magic techniques in
addition to their own unique lessons. The
following list is not an exhaustive coverage
of everything in the Great Library, but it is a
starting point for players and Storytellers who
wish to determine the capabilities of Assamite
sorcerers. Names in parentheses are the names
that the sorcerer caste prefers to use for each
item, if the Assamite name differs from the
commonly accepted one. Paths marked with
an asterisk are usually options for an Assamite
sorcerer to learn as his primary path, provided
his instructor approves.
Paths: The Path of Blood, The Lure of
Flames*, Movement of the Mind*, The Path
of Conjuring, Hands of Destruction
Rituals: Defense of the Sacred Haven (Curtain of Will), Wake with Evening’s Freshness
(Black Sunrise), Communicate with Kindred
Sire (Speak with Sire), Deflection of Wooden
Doom (Turn the Impaling Shaft), Ward versus Ghouls, Principal Focus of Vitae Infusion
(Draught of the Pebble), Incorporeal Passage
(Passage of the Ghul), Bone of Lies (Stain of
Guilt)

assisting the warrior caste on the battlefield. Awakening of the Steel is one legacy of this preparedness,
a path that some say began with the alchemists who
studied in the forges of Toledo and Damascus. This set
of techniques focuses on the symbolism of the sword
as the ultimate extension of a trained warrior’s body,
drawing on the myths that various warrior traditions
attached to their swords and daggers: European Crusaders and their blessed blades, the kris of Indonesian
Pentjak-Silat practitioners, and Indian Ghurkas and
their kukri knives, among others. The practitioner of
Awakening of the Steel focuses on this symbolism as
he uses the power of his blood to enhance his weapon
and his skill.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

A student of Awakening of the Steel finds that a
keen understanding of both the form and the function
of a blade is necessary for full mastery of this path. A
character must have a level of either Melee or Crafts
Ability equal to his level in Awakening of the Steel.
Those who practice this path also find that its lessons
are tightly focused, perhaps to the point of overspecialization. The path is at its most effective with swords
and knives, and the wielder can only extend its effects
to other edged weapons. Any attempt to use a technique of this path on another edged weapon is at +1
difficulty.

• Confer with the Blade
Although few Assamites claim to have actually spoken to a weapon’s soul, blacksmiths and warriors alike
have ascribed spiritual qualities to hand-forged blades
for centuries. Practitioners of Auspex are familiar with
the manner in which inanimate objects can bear impressions of their own history. Confer with the Blade
allows a weapon’s wielder to delve into the events that
have occurred around his weapon. Some practitioners
of this power claim this makes the weapon feel more
“comfortable” in their hands, while others speak of the
sense of history that an ancient blade bears. The actual
impressions only take an instant to gain, though many
prefer to spend much longer in contemplation if time
permits.
System: The number of successes determines the
amount of information the sorcerer gains regarding the
blade’s history and its present state, as well as all infor-

mation yielded by a lesser number of successes. With
three or more successes, the sorcerer may lower the
difficulty on his next attempt to apply a blood-magic
ritual to the weapon by one.

•• Grasp of the Mountain
The best scimitar in all creation does its owner no
good if it’s lying five yards away from him. Grasp of
the Mountain strengthens the spiritual bond between
the sword and the swordsman in order to reinforce the
wielder’s physical grip on his weapon. A blade that
is under the effect of this art never leaves its master’s
hand unless he so wills it.
System: For the rest of the scene, the character has
a number of automatic successes to resist all attempts
to disarm him, equal to the number of successes rolled.
He cannot accidentally drop the blade (which means
his botches are likely to result in self-mutilation instead of an empty hand). If the character is somehow
disarmed in spite of Grasp of the Mountain, he may
call the blade back to his hand by successfully invoking
this power again, assuming he has a clear line of sight
to the weapon.

••• Pierce Steel’s Skin
At this level of understanding, the sorcerer can command his blade with such precision that he can strike
at an opponent’s physical protection rather than his
body. The sword transfers its full fury to the intended
target, shredding even the toughest chain or plate. This
strips away the victim’s defenses, leaving him vulner-

Successes
One success		
			
			

Result
Physical information only: precise length and weight (to the micrometer and 		
milligram), chemical composition (assuming the character understands metallurgy),
number of damage dice and type of damage (lethal or aggravated).

Two successes		
			

Historical overview: when and where the blade was forged, the name and face of its
smith, brief glimpses of significant events in its existence.

Three successes
			
			

Sorcerous understanding: the type and relative level of power of any enchantments
or supernatural enhancements that the blade possesses as well as the name and face
of the individual who laid them.

Four successes		
			
			

Subliminal synthesis: comprehensive knowledge of the sword’s history. For the next
seven nights, the character recognizes the taste of any blood that has ever stained
the blade if she tastes it herself.

Five successes		
			
			
			

Total communion: The sword and the wielder become linked at a level deeper than
the physical and more enduring than the immediate. The Storyteller determines 		
what information the sword holds for the character, but it may include any event
in the blade’s history or any aspect of its present existence and condition.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

able to the next attack. While this power is of limited
utility in modern nights, as traditional armor has fallen
by the wayside, it remains in the path’s progression of
lessons due to its utility in destroying other obstacles.
System: While Pierce Steel’s Skin is in effect, an attack against an unarmored target inflicts half damage
(rounded down). However, for a number of turns equal
to the number of successes rolled, each successful attack the character makes against an armored foe inflicts damage on the target’s body armor rather than injuring him directly. Only metal armor can be damaged
by this power. When the character makes a successful
attack against an armored target, the player does not
roll damage. Instead, he rolls a number of dice equal
to the sword’s damage bonus (the number of dice that
it adds to his Strength) against a difficulty of 7. Each
success reduces the armor’s soak bonus by one die. Armor that is reduced to zero soak dice in this manner
is completely destroyed and unsalvageable. Additional
successes beyond those needed to destroy a piece of armor have no effect.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, Pierce Steel’s Skin
may destroy other inanimate objects (walls, doors, cars,
dramatically appropriate obstacles) without significant
damage to the sword. For the purposes of this power,
Fortitude counts as part of the target’s Stamina, not
external armor.

•••• Razor’s Shield
Many swordsmen hold that the duel is the ultimate
test of the warrior because it places all opponents on an
equal footing: Death is only three feet of steel away, and
only the skill of the combatants determines who walks
away. However, observers who are more pragmatic than
romantic note that an enemy with a ranged weapon
(be it bow, sling, or gun) has the advantage of striking from much farther away than arm’s length. While
Awakening of the Steel cannot completely counteract
this advantage, this power allows the skilled sorcerer
some measure of defense as the sword interposes itself
between its master and attacks from afar.
System: For a number of turns equal to the number
of successes rolled, the character may attempt to parry
projectiles. This requires one action for each projectile
that the player wishes to block, and the character must
be able to see the shot coming (Heightened Senses allows visual tracking of bullets). Each parrying attempt
requires a Dexterity + Melee roll, with a difficulty determined by the speed of the projectile. Thrown objects have a difficulty of 6, arrows and crossbow bolts a

442

difficulty of 7, and bullets a difficulty of 9. Each success
subtracts one success from the attacker’s attack roll.
Razor’s Shield does not allow the character to parry
ranged attacks that do not incorporate solid projectiles,
such as flame, lightning, or spat blood.

••••• Strike at the True Flesh
Although pacifists may find other uses for blades, a
warrior knows that swords were created for one purpose: to carve an enemy’s flesh into bloody ruin. Strike
at the True Flesh invokes the very essence of the sorcerer’s weapon, reducing it to the embodiment of its
very definition (or, as the more classically minded
would put it, invoking the Platonic form) while simplifying its target to a similarly basic level. The results
of such an invocation are usually devastating on both a
philosophical and practical level as weapon and victim
momentarily lose all supernatural attributes.
System: The effects of Strike at the True Flesh last
for a number of turns equal to the number of successes
rolled, and they end with the first successful attack that
the character makes within this time period. The sword
inflicts only the base amount of lethal damage that a
weapon of its size and type would normally cause, disregarding all enhancements that it may have received
(though augmentations to the wielder’s strength or
speed, such as Potence and Celerity, still have their normal effects, as do extra successes on the attack roll).
However, all the target’s supernatural defenses (including Fortitude) are likewise negated — he soaks the
attack only with his base Stamina. If the negation of
his powers and defenses renders the target unable to
soak lethal damage, he cannot soak the attack at all.
Body armor does protect against this attack, as it is a
mundane form of defense.

Bardo
This Discipline has been handed down since Osiris
himself first discovered this path. It involves attainment of a constant state of mystical consciousness, only
achieved by the rigid, ascetic unlife of the Children.
This Discipline is not the same state as Golconda. Golconda is a realization and acceptance of the way things
are, while the Children’s Disciplines are based on denial. They deny the Beast within them by intensely concentrating on their Humanity and their state of death.
If a Child was to give up his meditations and discipline,
he would be assailed by his Beast.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

The Child must maintain Humanity equal to their
highest level of ability, or else lose that ability. For
example, a Child must have a Humanity of 9 to gain
the ninth level of attainment. If the Child’s Humanity
ever drops below the required level, then the ability of
that level is lost and must be bought all over again with
experience points. The Child can counteract this with
Restore Humanitas (below).
A Child of Osiris cannot follow any type of moral
code other than Humanity.

• Restore Humanitas
The first thing that the Children of Osiris are taught
is that Humanity does not have to be an inexorable
slide into depravity. Instead, it is more akin to a climb
up an extremely steep hill. The vampire is going to lose
some ground, but with perseverance and strength, he
can regain it.

successes the player rolls are subtracted from the successes on the attacker’s roll. The sign does not serve
to turn aside magically enhanced physical attacks; a
punch from a vampire with the Potence Discipline still
has the full effect.

••• Gift of Apis
All vampires must consume blood, no matter how
good their intentions. While this basic fact of undeath
cannot be circumvented, the Children of Osiris can at
least avoid drinking human blood.
System: Animal blood is just as nourishing to the
character as human blood. An animal is considered to
have a blood pool equal to the number of health levels it has, rather than the lesser value usually assigned
to represent the creature’s less-than-filling fluids (see
p. 270 for more on drinking from animals). This ability
is always active.

System: When the vampire loses a dot of Humanity,
he can attempt to regain it without spending experience points by using this power. The Child must use
this power within a week of losing the Humanity, and
must not have lost any more Humanity since the initial
loss (that is, if the character falls from Humanity 8 to
Humanity 7, and then falls to Humanity 6 before using
this power, Restore Humanitas can only be used to recover Humanity 7). The character meditates for several hours, and spends all of the blood points currently in
his body. The player then rolls Conscience (difficulty
equal to the level of Humanity being regained). If the
roll succeeds, the character regains the dot of Humanity and (if applicable) the dot of Conscience lost to
a botched degeneration roll. If the character gained a
derangement, it fades within a week of using Restore
Humanitas.

•••• Pillar of Osiris

•• Banishing Sign of Thoth

Once the Pillar is created, any vampire with at least
one dot of Bardo receives a -3 to the difficulties of any
Discipline or other mystical activity (including blood
magic) performed at the Pillar. However, this requires
regular trips to the Pillar. Once the vampire has created a Pillar, he must visit it at least once a month, or
it ceases to function. In addition, for every week he
is away from a Pillar (not necessarily the one he created), the difficulties of all rolls to avoid frenzy increase
by one. The Beast, long denied by the Child’s ascetic
practices, grows in strength while away from the Pillar, and eventually pushes the vampire to frenzy and
(likely) Humanity loss. The Children of Osiris, for this
and other reasons, do not leave their temples for long.

The character gestures, turning aside any supernatural effect aimed at her. The source of the effect does not
matter. She can thwart, or at least blunt, the strength
of any mystical attack. This sign was supposedly taught
to Osiris by Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom and
magic. What Thoth actually was — vampire, mortal,
or spellcaster — is lost to time.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 7). This power can be
used to “dodge” any incoming attack of a mystical nature, including any Disciplines that target the character (whether or not they actually inflict damage). Any

In the center of every temple is a Pillar of Osiris, a
place of meditation and power in which the Children’s
magic is greatly increased. At this level of Bardo, the
character learns to create such a Pillar, meaning that
he can create his own temple.
System: Creating the Pillar of Osiris requires a
night-long ritual, with the difficulty determined by the
location. The more remote and free from violence the
location is, the lower the difficulty. A cave far from
human populations that has never seen violence might
be difficulty 5, which the site of a grisly murder-suicide
in a downtown area would be difficulty 9. The player
spends a Willpower point and rolls Willpower. Success
creates the Pillar, which does not require a physical pillar — the Pillar of Osiris is conceptual, not literal.

••••• Paradox
The Child utters a phrase or a riddle that lays bare
the truth of the universe to a listener. That truth — the
perspective of that one listener’s importance weighed
against the whole of creation — is enough to immobilize the target for short while. Although this experience would seem to be disheartening, after the fact
the targets are loath to harm the Child. Whether that’s
because of a newfound appreciation for one’s place in
the world, or out of fear that the vampire will reveal
the paradox again, no one really knows.
System: The vampire speaks the phrase, and the
player spends a point of Willpower and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to the listener’s current
Willpower). If multiple listeners are present, the player
rolls against the highest difficulty. If the roll is successful, the listener(s) is immobilized for the scene as he
contemplates what he has heard. Striking the victim
snaps him out of it. At the end of the scene, the paradox is gone, and the target can’t ever quite explain it.
He does, however, suffer a permanent +1 difficulty to
harm or act against the Child of Osiris.

••••• • Boon of Anubis
The vampire can protect a mortal from Embrace,
leaving instructions for Anubis, the judge of the dead,
not to take this particular mortal to his scales. If the
mortal is Embraced while under the power of this Discipline, she simply sleeps for a full night and day, and
awakens aching and sick, but unharmed.
In order to enact this power, the Child of Osiris must
kiss the mortal, usually on the forehead.
System: The vampire spends a point of Willpower
and rolls Humanity. If the roll succeeds, the target is
immune to the Embrace for a number of months equal
to the successes rolled. The player can spend a dot of
Willpower to make the effect permanent. Note that
this Discipline does not protect against any other form
of death than the Embrace. If a vampire drains the unfortunate victim dry and then shoots her in the head,
she dies just the same. However, the difficulty to avoid
degeneration when killing or harming someone under
protection of this power is increased by three.

••••• •• Bring Forth the Dawn
This power does not actually cause the sun to rise, but
rather triggers the daysleep in Kindred. The Child simply gestures, and the target’s Beast responds as though
the sun had just risen outside. The Child can then beat

444

a hasty retreat — or stake and behead the vampire now
lying helpless before him.
System: The player spends a blood point for each
vampire to be affected and rolls Manipulation + Occult in a contested roll against each target’s Humanity
or Path (both rolls at difficulty 7). If the target wins,
the power fails. If the Child wins, however, all affected
vampires fall asleep for a number of hours equal to the
Child’s net successes. Followers of Set and other bloodlines that share their weakness suffer a -2 to their dice
pool for this roll. Any Disciplines or Thaumaturgy rituals which protect the Kindred during their sleep also
work in defending against this level of Bardo.

••••• ••• Mummification
The Children of Osiris have an uneasy relationship
with destroying other vampires. They would prefer not
to do so, but some Kindred are too evil to be allowed
to exist. For the vampires that straddle the line — that
are wicked, but retain a spark of Humanity — the Children sometimes use Mummification.
This long ritual allows a vampire to be put into torpor for as long as the Child wishes. The target can attempt to struggle free, but only once per century. Once
the vampire is mummified, the Children usually seal
her up in a deep tomb, where (hopefully) she will remain undisturbed.
System: The target must be immobilized, ritually
bound in strips of fabric, and prepared with incense
and special herbs. The player then rolls Willpower in a
contested action against the target’s Willpower (both
difficulty 8). If the Child wins, the target enters torpor. If the victim wins, he remains awake and the ritual
cannot be completed for another night (meaning that
resistance is usually temporary). The target can also attempt to shake the spell free once per century, with a
Willpower roll (difficulty 9).
Ghouls can also be mummified, but they get no
chance to escape.

••••• •••• Ra’s Blessing
This ritual is difficult, but allows the vampire to accomplish the impossible — walking in sunlight, fully
experiencing the day once more. Gaining Ra’s Blessing
requires a month-long period of fasting and meditation,
at the end of which the character might be granted the
chance to spend a few precious hours in sunlight. Even
this brief period, however, can bolster the character’s
Humanity.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

System: After completing the month of contemplation, the character ritually washes herself and prepares
to greet the dawn. The player spends 10 blood points
and rolls Humanity (difficulty 9). Every success allows
the character to withstand the sunlight as if she were
mortal for a single hour. If the roll fails or botches, the
character cannot attempt Ra’s Blessing for a decade.
If the roll succeeds, though, the character can use
the reaffirmation of seeing sunlight as a way to boost
her Humanity and Virtues. For every hour spent under the sun, the Child can roll his Humanity, or one
of his Virtues, against a difficulty of 9. Success means
that trait is raised by one, while failure or botching this
room means no gain.

Daimoinon
These are the mysteries of the Baali, black arts torn
whole and beating from the sorcerer-kings of ancient
cultures and prehistoric civilizations, incoherent
memories passed from tome to tongue, hearkening to
times of oblivion. They are sibilant secrets in which all
begins to end and begin again. With every new night
and novice brought into the circle, the telling grows
shorter.

• Sense the Sin
A real mark always convinces himself. The most
dangerous Baali aren’t the ones that use extortion,
threats, or over displays of power; the most dangerous
Demons simply know how to talk their victims into
cutting their own throats. This power allows the Baali
to find a target’s particular vice.
System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy
against living or undead beings; the difficulty is equal
to the subject’s Self-Control or Instincts +4. If successful, the Baali can sense the subject’s greatest weakness.
The significance of this information is dictated by the
degree of success: One success might determine a low
Virtue, weak Willpower, or a poorly defended avenue
of approach, while two might yield a closely guarded
secret or conversational misstep. Three or more yields
a central derangement or formative trauma from the
subject’s past.

•• Fear of the Void Below
Once the Baali has mastered reading a subject’s darkest secrets, he can reach into the victim’s mind and
twist what he finds there. The shock of feeling one’s

most deeply held beliefs and darkest fears manipulated
can send the victim into catatonia or fits of panic.
System: The Baali must first employ Sense the Sin
(above) or use some other method to discern the tragic
flaw of the target. She must then speak to the target,
playing upon his inadequacies and the inescapable
consequences of his shortcomings. A successful Wits
+ Intimidation roll (difficulty of the subject’s Courage
+4) drives the victim into fits of terror (one success),
mindless panic-borne flight similar to Rötschreck (two
successes), or even unconsciousness (three or more
successes). All effects last for the remainder of the
scene. Kindred targets may resist with a Courage roll
(difficulty equal to the Baali’s Willpower) — they are
accustomed to dealing with their Beasts. If the Kindred
target garners more successes than the Baali did on her
original roll, he resists the power completely.

••• Conflagration
Not all of the Baali’s powers are designed for manipulation and subtlety. The Demons can also call up the
fire from the realms of their infernal patrons, hurling it
at their enemies in exultation of the Outer Dark. This
fire spreads and burns normally, but at the moment of
creation it is black and cold, as though drawn from a
place where terrestrial physics do not apply.
System: The player spends a blood point. This creates
a bolt of black flame that inflicts one die of aggravated
damage; more blood points may be spent to increase
the size and damage of the flame. Such fires are fleeting
and dissipate at the end of the turn, unless the Baali
continues to spend blood points on Conflagration over
several turns, gradually creating a larger flame. The
player also rolls Dexterity + Occult (difficulty 6) to hit
his target, who may dodge as normal. Vampires confronted with this black fire make Rötschreck tests as if
confronted with a similar quantity of normal flame.

•••• Psychomachia
With this power, the Baali combines his ability to
read the psyche of a victim with the ability to summon
up matter from the Outer Dark. Psychomachia pits a
victim against the most dangerous, shameful parts of
her own subconscious.
System: The vampire, after learning the targets tragic flaw (such as after using Sense the Sin, above), forces
the subject’s player to roll her lowest Virtue (difficulty
6). Failing this roll pits the target against an apparition
summoned from her darker self, perceptible to the subject only. The target may see or feel his abusive father,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

445

a long-dead lover, a childhood bogeyman, or (for Kindred victims) even the Beast itself. A botch indicates
the target has been overwhelmed and frenzies — or,
worse, becomes possessed by his inner demons.
This imaginary antagonist may be wholly narrated,
or assigned Traits equivalent or slightly inferior to the
victim’s, at the Storyteller’s option. All injuries sustained by the target in such an encounter are illusory
(substitute catatonia or torpor for death as appropriate)
and vanish upon the phantasm’s defeat or the Baali’s
loss of concentration.

••••• Condemnation
The Baali levies a curse upon the victim. The more
skillful in her dark studies the Baali has become, the
more dire the curse is likely to be. Legend states that
some Baali can wield curses so foul that the victims attempt suicide after a single night — only to find that
they can no longer die.
System: An Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty
equal to the subject’s Willpower) dictates the length
and severity of the curse. Successes must be split between both these effects, as per the sidebar below.
The player must split successes between effect and
duration – curses with zero successes allotted to duration last for one night. For example, if the Baali’s player
rolls four successes, she can inflict a two-success curse
for one month, a three-success curse for up to week,
or a four-success curse for one night. At any time, the
Baali may choose to end the curse. Storytellers should
feel free to invent creative or story-appropriate curses.

••••• • Concordance
The Baali makes a Devil’s bargain and takes the
unholy nature of his masters into his own being. This
warps his body both to his detriment and benefit. A
truly dedicated Demon might make numerous such
pacts, growing more grotesque and more powerful each
time.
System: The most typical manifestation of this
power incorporates immunity to the damaging effects
of fire, though other equivalently-powered assets may
be available at the Storyteller’s option. Most of these
tributes take the form of left-handed “gifts” with unforeseen consequences (a telltale bronze tint to flameresistant flesh, a vestigial set of wings, visible talons or
horns that cannot be concealed, etc.). This Discipline
may be purchased more than once at greater cost to
body and soul. (The current shaitan is said to have been
so gnarled and twisted by the Masters as to be no longer even remotely mistakable for human.)
Note that three of the banes particular to the Baali
— piety, vulnerability to sunlight, and dependency on
blood for sustenance — may not be overcome by this
Discipline under any circumstances. In the end, it is
up to the Storyteller’s discretion what the Baali can or
cannot withstand.

••••• •• Summon the Herald of Topheth
Using the same skill that allows for calling up demon-fire, the Baali can call a minion of his masters to
Earth. Although the names assigned them differ (angel, demon, daeva, djinn, efreet, malakim, shedim, and

countless others), the end results are the same. This
being is under the Baali’s control, at least for a short
time after being summoned. Yet scholars who have
studied the blasphemous rite by which this Discipline
is enacted note that no provision is made for banishing
the Herald.
System: To summon a Herald of Topheth, the Demon must spend at least three blood points and perform an infernal ceremony. Heralds of Topheth have
the following stats: Attributes 10/7/3, Abilities (15
points worth), Willpower 8, Disciplines (10 points
worth), Fortitude of at least 3, and the capacity to heal
one health level at least every other round. Storytellers should feel free to alter these guidelines based on
the power level of the troupe and the form the Herald
takes. Though most celestial beings chafe at the notion
of wearing a single shape, many adopt those common
to myth and legend; preternatural succubi or angels,
reptilian horrors, and bat-winged monsters are among
the most often seen.

••••• ••• Contagion
The most damaging disease is human sin. Pandora
learned it to her detriment, as did the ungrateful and
impolite denizens of Sodom. The Baali, of course, revel
in the slow decay of human settlements, and Methuselahs of the bloodline learn to infect a mortal community with jealousy, slander, hate, and bigotry. Crime
and violence soar, petty angers give rise to seething
hatreds, and local economies take a downward spiral.
Marriages end over trivial quarrels and the world becomes a nastier place in general. In the history of the
Baali, entire towns and villages have been temporarily
enslaved to an infernal master’s will.
System: Successes garnered on an Intelligence + Occult roll (difficulty 9) must be divided between the intensity and the area of the desired effect – at least two
successes are needed to cover both area and effect. Sufficiently high degrees of Auspex or powers that detect
demons may be able to pick up on this vague, malevolent aura; otherwise they will simply assume that times
have taken a dire change for the worse.

••••• •••• Call the Great Beast
This Discipline is largely theoretical. Baali have, in
the past, boasted that their most powerful elders know
a ritual that can tear a rift to the Outer Dark and allow
the creatures that dwell there into our world. Occasionally, a vampire destroys a Baali and sees the beginnings of such a ritual carved on a wall or tattooed onto
a minion’s flesh. But even among the Kindred who
know of the Baali and what they are capable of, the
ability to Call the Great Beast doesn’t meet with much
credence. This isn’t because the Kindred don’t think
it’s possible, but because they realize that if a Demon
ever succeeded in using it, there wouldn’t be much to
be done anyway.
System: The preparatory ritual requires a tremendous investment of time and sacrifice; veiled allusions
such as “fivescore souls, plucked clean and whole” and
“when three times sets the hooded sun” indicate a selective sacrificial rite spanning days, nights, and dozens
of victims. (Deviation or imperfection in this litany
may well have unforeseen consequences, ranging from
simple failure to unwelcome demonic attention)
At this point, the high priest expends all of his permanent Willpower and releases his consciousness in a
desperate attempt to breach the gulf Beyond, becoming an empty vessel for whatever will most effectively
end the world as your chronicle knows it. You’re the
Storyteller — what would the Devil do to your world?
(Call the Great Beast has two main functions in the
chronicle. It’s either a plot device that the characters
must work to prevent, or a means to change the world
of Vampire into a demon-infested apocalypse. Either is
useful, but it’s not the sort of power that a vampire just
pulls out casually.)

Flight
Gargoyles possess a fourth in-clan Discipline, called
Flight. All Gargoyles start with a free dot, and it can
be increased like any other Discipline. As the Gargoyle
gains dots of Flight, he becomes capable of flying faster,
as follows:

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

447

• The character cannot actually fly, but can soar like
a hang-glider. He also cannot carry anything (he needs
his hands to help steer). Maximum speed is equal to
prevailing winds, or 15 miles/25 kilometers per hour
in calm air.
•• The character can make a running takeoff and
carry 20 pounds/10 kilograms while flying. Maximum
speed is 30 miles/50 kilometers per hour.
••• The character can make a straight, vertical
takeoff if unencumbered, or can make a running takeoff carrying up to 50 pounds/25 kg. Maximum air speed
is 45 miles/70 kilometers per hour.
•••• The character can now make a vertical takeoff
with up to 50 pounds/25 kg of baggage, but can carry up
to 100 pounds/45 kg while flying. Maximum speed is 60
miles/95 kilometers per hour.
••••• The character can now carry up to 200
pounds/90 kg, easily enough to carry away an adult
person (or vampire). Maximum speed is 75 miles/120
kilometers per hour.
Further dots in the Discipline add 100 pounds/45 kg
of weight and 20 miles/30 kilometers per hour to the
speed. Gargoyles don’t think of Flight as a Discipline.
To them, it’s just flight, part and parcel to being a Gargoyle, and may be baffled by notions such as teaching
it to other vampires.

Koldunic Sorcery
The actual casting of Koldunic sorcery requires more
than a clumsy exertion of will. Such magic demands
perfection of form and mastery of the appropriate lore.
The caster’s player spends one blood point and rolls
(Attribute) + Occult against a difficulty of the power’s
level + 3, with the specific Attribute listed for each
path or “way.” Vampires always use the base Attribute,
ignoring any bonuses gained from blood expenditure
or other Disciplines. All kolduns must select one of the
ways listed below as their primary path.

The Way of Earth
Capable of great destruction and great healing, the
earth is the womb of life and the sepulcher of death. It
drinks all blood violently spilled upon its soil, and so
mirrors the vampire. It is by association with the earth
as a source of strength that a koldun enacts his will.

• Grasping Soil
A koldun invoking this power may command earth
to rise in a spray of dirt and crawl up a victim’s legs.
This power can only command soil, not stone, and may
only target victims standing on the earth.
System: The koldun may direct any patch of earth
within a 100-foot/30-meter radius to ensnare a target
for two turns per success rolled. Animated dirt ascends
and constricts midway between the victim’s knees and
hips, holding her fast unless her player scores five successes on Strength + Survival roll (difficulty 6). It is
also possible to use this power as an attack, in which
case the grasping earth crushes once and then releases.
Used in this manner, each success on the casting inflicts one level of lethal damage. Such damage manifests as broken legs and crushed feet.

•• Endurance of Stone
Drawing the essence of earth into himself, a koldun
may gain a measure of its preternatural resilience. Under the effects of this power, a vampire’s skin resembles
a horrid fusion of flesh and stone that cracks and flows
impossibly with every movement.
System: A successful activation roll grants the koldun two extra dots of Stamina for the rest of the scene.
These dots are considered part of the character’s natural Stamina and may aid in any uses of that Attribute,
including soak.

••• Hungry Earth
Expanding on the power of Grasping Soil, a koldun
may use this power to drag a victim into the earth.
He need only gesture and the soil beneath his victim
opens like the maw of a great beast. This power may
ensnare any victim who stands upon the earth within
100 feet/30 meters of the koldun.
System: Like Grasping Soil, every success on the activation roll leaves the victim immobile for one turn.
However, the difficulty of the Strength + Survival roll
to break free increases to 8 and doing so still requires
five successes. As the earth continues to shift and grasp
while the power remains active, this roll must be made
as a single (though repeatable) attempt rather than an
extended test. In addition, beings trapped in the crushing pit suffer one level of lethal damage each turn. Beings capable of soaking this damage may do so, but at
difficulty 7. At the end of the power’s duration, the
earth yawns once more to release the victim.

Attribute: Stamina

448

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

•••• Root of Vitality
As with Hungry Earth, the koldun may direct the
land to bury any target standing on the earth within
a 100-foot/30-meter radius. Yet this power is far more
benevolent in its intent, if no less disturbing in its
manifestation. The soil ripples, parting and closing like
some obscene womb as it draws the target a full yard
beneath the surface. Living beings entombed in this
fashion do not suffocate, as the enchanted soil pumps
air from above in undulating breaths. Better still, the
fertile essence of the earth presses upon her flesh and
restores it to new health. Still, the process is highly
disturbing and unnatural, especially as targets remain
wholly aware in silent, helpless immobility for the full
duration. It is possible for a koldun to heal himself with
this power.
System: The player spends as many blood points as
desired (which may require multiple turns depending
on Generation) and makes the activation roll. Each
success permits the earth to heal two levels of bashing damage or one level of lethal damage. Healing aggravated damage requires two successes per level. The
total number of health levels that may be restored with
each use of this power is the number of blood points
invested or the number of successes on the activation
roll, whichever is lower. Any blood points spent beyond the number of successes drain away to no effect.
The actual healing process takes one turn per bashing
level, one minute per lethal level, and one hour per
aggravated level. Once the healing is complete or the
power is interrupted through determined excavation,
the earth expels the target back to the surface.

••••• Kupala’s Fury
Mortals pray in fear when the mountains shake.
They fear the wrath of the Old Gods, and rightfully so.
This is not a power used lightly or capriciously, because
it represents one of the greatest weapons available to
Koldunic Sorcery.
System: This power requires a Willpower point in
addition to the usual cost and activation roll. The koldun smites the earth with his fist, and his anger flows
through the soil to any target in his line of sight. The
quake erupts outward from that point, inflicting 10
dice of lethal damage on everything and everyone in
the area of effect. Most wooden structures collapse
entirely and even buildings of concrete and steel may
grow cracked and pitted with superficial damage from
the shaking earth. This tremor lasts one turn and affects an area determined by the number of successes

rolled. It is not possible to apply fewer successes than
those rolled.

The Way of Wind
Subtler than mastery over earth, this way evokes the
air in the breath of the living and last rattle of a dying
man. In stillness or motion, koldun turn all aspects of
air to their unliving design.
Attribute: Perception

• Breath of Whispers
Even in their absence, koldun instill deep fear in
their servants. This power carries the vampire’s words
on a light breeze and returns with the target’s reply.
The vampire need only address the target by name and
forcibly mimic a deep exhalation of breath as he speaks
his message.
System: Every time the koldun wishes to send a
new message via this power, his player makes the usual
activation roll. However, the player need only spend
blood the first time the power is used during a given
scene. Each success permits one turn of speech. After
the vampire concludes the message, swift winds carry
it to its destination. Within a minute, the target hears
the koldun as if the vampire whispered in his ear. He
may reply or remain silent, but anything he says within
a number of turns equal to the koldun’s successes flies
back to the koldun. This power may bring words to
anyone within a mile (one and a half kilometers) who
is not in a sealed room. While using this power, a koldun must concentrate fully. Any disturbance breaks
the communication.

•• Biting Gale
Vengeful koldun sought to invoke a wind as chill
as air atop the Carpathian Mountains. This power
achieves that end, unleashing a cutting wind that can
freeze a man’s blood in his veins as it swirls through an

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

449

area of his choosing. Besides its obvious combat applications, this power also facilitates a dramatic entrance
for those so inclined.

unleashing spiraling gusts and a driving downpour of
freezing rain. Lightning arcs overhead, with each thunderous flash casting jagged shadows.

System: With a successful activation roll, the koldun summons a freezing wind within a maximum of
a 100-yard/meter radius. Anyone caught in this frigid blast suffers one die of bashing damage each turn
(which may be soaked normally), loses two dice from
all Dexterity pools, and moves at half normal speed.
The winds last as long as the koldun wills, provided he
maintains concentration. Any non-reflexive actions
on the part of the vampire cause the winds to still and
dissipate. This includes any movement.

System: With a successful activation roll and a point
of Willpower (in addition to the usual blood), a koldun
may conjure a terrible storm. It takes six hours for the
clouds to gather and thicken overhead, minus one hour
for every success rolled. If this results in a duration of
less than one hour, the clouds blossom outward from
directly overhead like a black canopy, filling the sky in
mere minutes. Once the clouds form, the rain begins
to fall in torrents and the lightning begins. The storm
persists at full strength for one hour per success rolled. It
gradually dissipates over the hour following that. During
the peak of its fury, the storm may cause flooding and
certainly chills any exposed mortal to the bone (1 die
of unsoakable bashing damage every five minutes of full
exposure). Lightning strikes regularly, far more than a
usual storm. Indeed, for a cost of one Willpower point,
a koldun may direct lightning at a foe using his Perception + Occult (difficulty 6). A successful strike inflicts
10 dice of lethal damage (which can be soaked normally). Only one such attack may be made each turn.

••• Breeze of Lethargy
Although they cannot induce immediate sleep, the
winds evoked by this power bring growing exhaustion
and numbing weariness through every muscle. Victims
of this power often smell a hint of bittersweet smoke
before they fall entranced.
System: For two turns per success, the koldun creates a wind inflicting extreme lethargy within a 200foot/60-meter radius. Players of characters caught in
this wind must roll Stamina + Survival (difficulty 8).
This roll is made once every ten minutes of exposure.
Failure means the character halves all dice pools involving physical actions for the remaining duration of
the wind and halves all movement rates for the scene.
A botch puts the character to sleep (or a state of light
torpor for vampires) for the scene. Sleeping characters
awaken if prodded, shaken, or otherwise manhandled,
though they move slowly and may suffer halved dice
pools if the wind persists.

•••• Ride the Tempest
A koldun employing this power moves at incredible
speeds as he rides along the winds. While traveling
with this power, a vampire assumes a blurred form that
coalesces as he reaches his destination.
System: With a successful activation roll, the koldun
fades into the wind and flies at 250 mph/400 kph to his
destination. This power cannot effectively function in
caves, buildings, or other enclosed areas. Outside, the
vampire’s flight navigates all obstacles. Once the koldun arrives at his destination or the scene ends, the
vampire descends to earth and solidifies.

••••• Tempest
Applying fury magnified by blood and will, a koldun
may project the full measure of his anger into the night
sky. Churning gray clouds blot out stars and moon,

450

The Way of Water
Largely practiced by koldun with havens near a large
water source, this way can raise watery spirit slaves and
dash a ship to splinters. More subtly, the vampire may
lurk in the depths or conjure illusions to confound and
dazzle his foes.
Attribute: Wits

• Pool of Lies
This versatile power creates three-dimensional illusions along the surface of a water source. How a koldun
uses such illusions depends on his temperament and
will. It is just as easy to feign a divine visitation as a
cunning seduction.
System: With a successful activation roll, the koldun may project an illusion on any water surface in line
of sight. The illusion may speak and move however the
vampire wishes, though it has no substance and cannot step beyond the bounds of the water. The phantom
lasts one turn per success rolled, after which it slowly
dissipates into fine mist. It is possible to extend this
lifespan with subsequent activations of the power, each
of which stack in determining final duration. Rolls to
extend an illusion’s duration add one to the base difficulty, but require no blood. Once an illusion fades
away, it must be cast anew.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

•• Watery Haven
Just as the Gangrel meld with the earth, so may a
koldun with this power sink beneath the water to escape the sun. The vampire does not so much submerge
as merge with the water. Though his slumbering form
may be visible at odd angles from above, only the most
determined splashing can disturb his rest.
System: This power requires no blood. If the player gains
two or more successes on the activation roll, the vampire
sinks into the water as per the Protean power Earth Meld.
A body of water must be at least two feet deep and as large
in other dimensions as the vampire’s body to contain him.
Catching a glimpse of a hidden koldun in the water requires
a successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 8).

••• Fog Over Sea
Moving with the unnatural grace of a ghost, a koldun
employing this power may stride across water as readily
as land, leaving nary a ripple to mark his passing. Some
vampires delight in using this power in conjunction
with Pool of Lies to conjure phantasms to attend them.
System: For every success on the activation roll, the
koldun may walk on water for one scene or one hour,
whichever is longer. A koldun may choose to drop

the effects of this power in order to submerge or swim;
however, the vampire may not walk on water again unless he reactivates the power.

•••• Minions of the Deep
By dripping his blood into a body of water, a koldun
may summon or rouse embodied water elementals to
serve him for a night. Such minions are infallibly loyal,
if not especially clever. Despite their liquid form, they
are solid enough to grab a man and drag him to a watery grave or pummel him like the crashing surf.
System: The player spends one Willpower point and
makes the standard activation roll. With success, the
player may spend blood to summon elemental minions.
This blood must be dripped or flung into a body of water, which may require multiple turns depending on
generational limits for blood expenditure.
Once the last drop of blood falls, the water rises into
whatever form the koldun desires. The caster may create as many minions as blood points spent, though not
more than the total number of successes rolled. Regardless of their form, the spirits have a rating equal to
the vampire’s Wits in all Traits. These beings have no
Knowledges and no Skills apart from Stealth. Further-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

451

more, their Mental and Social Attributes are considered
to have a rating of 1 except in passive or defensive situations (such as to resist persuasion or mind-control).
Water elementals soak and otherwise suffer damage as
vampires, including from sunlight. Fire harms them less,
inflicting bashing damage only. Moreover, the watery
creatures may extinguish flames with their liquid bodies, though not without suffering injury. An elemental
who leaves the body of water that spawned it suffers
one level of aggravated damage per hour. Minions regenerate one level of damage of any kind (including
aggravated) each turn they remain in contact with a
large body of water, but do not otherwise heal. Unless
destroyed, summoned minions last until the next dawn
before collapsing into inanimate puddles.

••••• Doom Tide
Many ships lie at the bottom of the Black Sea, shattered by the whirlpools of the koldun. Victims of this
power must fight with every ounce of their strength or
fall into the whirling, airless depths below.
System: The player spends a Willpower point in addition to the usual blood. For every success on the activation roll, the resulting whirlpool has a radius of five
feet/1.5 meters, centered anywhere in the vampire’s line
of sight. Whirlpools have a base Strength of 15, increasing by 5 dots per success after the first. Victims must successfully oppose this Strength with their own Strength +
Survival (difficulty 8) in order to break free. Those who
fail are sucked into the depths and pounded with crushing
currents. Living beings drown normally, while vampires
and other non-breathing creatures simply remain trapped
helplessly in the vortex. This power lasts for one scene.

The Way of Fire
The ancient anathema of vampires, the element of
fire offers the most powerful and dangerous tool available to koldun. The Way of Fire shares aspects with the
Way of Earth, in that it focuses more on magma and
fiery rock than pure, naked flame.
Attribute: Manipulation

• Fiery Courage
No vampire can master an element he fears, so this power dims that fear to a mere ember of its former intensity.
System: Once learned, this power is permanent and
requires no activation roll or blood. The koldun subtracts his rating in the Way of Fire from the difficulty

452

of Courage rolls to resist Rötschreck from exposure or
proximity to flame. This power does not aid in resisting the panic that accompanies sunlight or any other
causes apart from actual fire. If this reduces the difficulty of a Courage roll below two, the koldun simply
does not succumb to the Red Fear. Koldun never risk
Rötschrek from fire and magma they conjure.

•• Combust
The Cainite’s eyes flash vivid orange with sorcerous
power as superheated air coils around the target. In
moments, the target bursts into spontaneous flame.
System: For every success on the activation roll, the
target suffers one level of aggravated damage. This attack may be dodged, but not blocked, and can affect
living (or unliving) beings at +2 difficulty. It is only
possible to make one fiery attack per turn.

••• Wall of Magma
The koldun raises his hand and the earth splits,
spraying a wall of glowing magma 10 feet/3 meters
high. Normally, this wall forms a 10-foot/3-meter radius circle around the vampire, although the sorcerer
can raise other shapes with practice and skill.
System: The wall of magma summoned with this
power has a lifespan of two turns per success rolled. If
the koldun wishes to release the magma along a shape
other than a protective circle, increase the base difficulty by one. Characters cannot approach a wall of
molten rock without a Courage roll (difficulty 8), and
even then, the close blistering heat inflicts a level of
aggravated damage. Actual contact with the lava increases the damage to three levels and raises the soak
difficulty to 9, assuming any sort of soak is possible. The
koldun takes no damage from his proximity to the summoned magma (although contact with it still damages
him as normal).

•••• Heat Wave
The koldun acts as a conduit for steam geysers and
channels a blast of desiccating air at a victim within
line of sight. This fiery wind appears as a rippling heat
wave enveloping the victim. Individuals slain with
this gruesome power appear as withered, mummified
husks.
System: On a successful activation roll, the victim
suffers five levels of lethal damage that may be soaked
by beings capable of such. Vampire targets also lose five
blood points, regardless of the damage inflicted.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

••••• Volcanic Blast

• The Missing Voice

At the final mastery of Way of Fire, a koldun commands lava to explode from the ground in a huge geyser. The molten rock spews across a wide swath before
crashing to earth and flowing in all directions. Anything in the path of the molten rock burns, melts, or
vaporizes within moments. The caster may direct the
lava to erupt anywhere in his line of sight.

The character can “throw” her voice anywhere within her line of sight. This enables the Daughter to carry
on surreptitious conversations, sing duets with herself,
or cause any number of distractions. This power can
also be combined with other Melpominee powers to
disguise their source (and some Daughters use it to
conceal the fact that Melpominee powers do not function through recorded media).

System: This power costs one Willpower point in addition to a blood point. For every success on the activation roll, the initial lava burst lasts one turn. The rivers
of burning liquid rock then flow sluggishly for twice
this duration before suddenly cooling and hardening.
Even if an object survives the heat, it now lies trapped
beneath the rock. Anything that makes contact with
lava (including the koldun) suffers a minimum of three
levels of aggravated damage. For objects that don’t
have health levels, the Storyteller must decide how
many turns they last before melting or erupting into
their own inferno. A botch on this power opens the
lava geyser under an unintended target, possibly the
koldun himself.

Melpominee
Named for Melpomene, the Greek Muse of tragedy,
the unique Discipline of the Daughters of Cacophony
is one of speech and song. The powers of this Discipline explore the various uses of the voice for both
benefit and harm. As is the case with mortal art, it is
not always clear which of those directions these powers
take. No character may have a rating in Melpominee
higher than her Performance rating. Melpominee affects the subject’s soul as well as the ears; thus, it works
perfectly well on deaf subjects, and has caused at least
one known breach of the Masquerade due to this effect.
Additionally, the powers of Melpominee work only on
those who are present when it is used — Daughters
of Cacophony cannot record Melpominee effects, send
them across radio waves, or have them streamed over
the Internet.
Daughters of Cacophony can use some of the powers of
the Melpominee Discipline in concert, as it were. If more
than one Siren uses the same level of this Discipline simultaneously, the difficulty for the roll falls by one for
each Daughter involved beyond the first. The difficulty
cannot fall lower than 3, however. The Discipline levels
that can benefit from this rule are noted below.

System: This power functions automatically as long
as the character wills it. However, using The Missing
Voice while performing any action other than speech
or singing incurs a penalty of two dice on that action
due to the disruption of the character’s concentration.

•• Phantom Speaker
The Daughter can project her voice to any individual she has personally met. Distance is no object,
but it must be night wherever the target presently is.
The vampire can sing, talk, or otherwise project her
voice in any way she sees fit (including other uses of
Melpominee), but she cannot hear what she is saying,
and therefore suffers a +1 difficulty to any rolls accompanying her utterance. For instance, the vampire could
project her voice to an enemy in an attempt to intimidate him, but would suffer a +1 to the difficulty of the
Charisma + Intimidation roll.
System: The player rolls Wits + Performance (difficulty 7) and spends a blood point. Each success allows one turn of speech; three or more successes allow
speech for an entire scene.

••• Madrigal
Music has the power to sway the listener, engendering specific emotions through artful lyrics, pounding
crescendo, or haunting melody. The Daughters of Cacophony can tap into music’s power, forcing listeners
to feel whatever they wish. The emotion becomes so
powerful that the listener must act, though what a listener does isn’t something the Siren can directly control.
System: The player rolls Charisma + Performance
(difficulty 7). Each success instills the chosen emotion
in a fifth of the Kindred’s audience (more than five successes have no additional effect). The Storyteller decides precisely which members of the audience are affected. Characters may resist this power for the duration
of the scene with the expenditure of a Willpower point,
but only if they have reason to believe that they are

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

453

being controlled by outside individuals. The song the
vampire sings must also reflect the emotion she wishes
to engender — no one’s going to mob the concert security no matter how well she sings “High Hopes,” but
they might if she performs “I Predict a Riot.”

ence to the fact that even mortal singers can shatter
glass at the right frequency, others note that volume
and intensity don’t seem to matter when a Daughter
employs Shattering Crescendo. The Siren can sing a
soothing lullaby and still kill a target.

Affected individuals should act in accordance with
their Natures — enraged Conformists would join a riot
but not start one, aroused Bravos may force their attentions on the object of their desire, and jealous Directors may send cronies after their rivals.

System: Use of this power requires that the victim
be within hearing range (characters with hearing difficulties — or Heightened Senses — are affected at the
same range as other victims). The player spends one
blood point and rolls Manipulation + Performance
(difficulty of the target’s Stamina + Fortitude). Each
success inflicts one health level of aggravated damage,
which may not be soaked. If using this power on an inanimate object, the Storyteller determines how many
dice (if any) the object may use to “soak” and how
many successes are needed to completely shatter it.

Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.

•••• Siren’s Beckoning
The Daughters of Cacophony don’t spread madness
as surely (or as visibly) as the Malkavians, but their
songs are definitely detrimental to one’s sanity. With
this power, the Daughter can drive any listener to madness. Most of the time, the victim is too fascinated to
realize that he should leave the area and block out the
music from his mind.
System: Siren’s Beckoning requires an extended,
resisted roll. The player rolls Manipulation + Performance (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower); the victim resists with a Willpower roll (difficulty equal to the singer’s Appearance + Performance).
If the singer accumulates five more successes than the
victim at any point, the hapless soul acquires a new
derangement or Psychological Flaw of the Storyteller’s
choice. This derangement normally lasts for one night,
with an additional night per success over five. With
a total of 20 net successes, the Daughter can make it
permanent.
Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.

••••• Virtuosa
Most of the low-level Melpominee powers can only
be used on one target at a time. When the Daughter
reaches this level of mastery in her Discipline, she can
“entertain” a wider audience. Each member of the audience hears the same message.
System: The Daughter may use Phantom Speaker or
Siren’s Beckoning on a number of targets equal to her
Stamina + Performance. The player must spend one
blood point for every five targets beyond the first.

••••• • Shattering Crescendo
The Daughter can sing powerfully enough to rend
flesh, split skin, and crack bone. While some Kindred
unfortunate enough to witness this power make refer-

454

Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.

••••• •• Persistent Echo
The Daughter can sing, speak, or even use a Melpominee power and leave the effect hanging in the air,
waiting for someone to come along and hear it. The
character can control who can trigger her latent song,
meaning that combined with Shattering Crescendo or
Siren’s Beckoning, this power can be used as a trap.
System: The player rolls Stamina + Performance
(difficulty 8) and spends a blood point. Each success
yields one turn of speech that may be left to be heard
later. If the player wishes to time-delay another Melpominee power, the roll for that power must be made
at +1 difficulty. The echo stays suspended for a maximum number of nights equal to twice the vampire’s
Stamina + Performance before fading.
The Kindred may choose to make the echo audible to
anyone who stands in her position for the duration of the
power — in effect, an endlessly looped mystic recording.
Conversely, she may choose for it to fade away once it
is heard for the first time. She may also choose to leave
it dormant until activated by the presence of a specific
individual with whom she is familiar. If the echo is made
a one-time-only effect, all traces of the power disappear
once the vampire’s words echo to the intended recipient.
If a character uses Heightened Senses in an area
where an “unactivated” echo exists, he will hear a faint
murmur. Three successes on a Perception + Occult roll
(difficulty 8) are necessary to hear the message, and a
botch on this roll will deafen the listener for the rest
of the night.
Multiple Daughters may use this Discipline in concert.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

Mytherceria
Whatever odd commingling of blood which produced the Kiasyd has led to a number of weird effects,
not least of which is the Mytherceria Discipline. This
collection of powers mimics the abilities of faeries —
or at least, that’s the best guess of the Kindred who are
familiar with it. The Kiasyd use this power to alter and
beguile the minds of their foes, as well as to force others
to tell the truth. The Kiasyd do not, in general, teach
this Discipline to those outside the bloodline, and supposedly it would require oaths sworn on the lifeblood
of the student to learn.

• Folderol
The Kiasyd can cleave truth from lies. The exact effect varies from vampire to vampire. Some Kiasyd experience bleeding from the eyes or ears when they hear
a lie, while some Weirdlings’ eyes glow when told a
falsehood. Whatever the effect, this power detects lies,
not mistakes, meaning that a target has to know he is
lying in order for this power to work.
System: The character knows when a target is deliberately lying. No roll or expenditure is necessary for
this power to work, but the character must deliberately
activate it. Note that this power does not provide any
insight into what the truth might be, nor does it enable
the vampire to tell if a target is simply stating something false that he believes to be true.

•• Fae Sight
The Kiasyd’s knowledge of magic isn’t just theoretical. Their strangely-colored eyes are capable of detecting the arcane energies of the fae, as well as magic from
other, more esoteric sources. They are not, however,
capable of using this power to detect the residue of
ghosts or vampiric magic.
System: The Kiasyd sees faeries and other faetouched mortals for what they really are, with no roll
required. Additionally, the player can detect any form
of magic that does not stem from ghosts or the undead,
including magic from mages, werewolves, and other
such odd sources. The character can recognize these
for what they truly are, provided he has seen similar
effects before.

••• Aura Absorption
The Kiasyd is capable of seeing images of events and
emotions past by touching an object or an area. However, unlike the Auspex Power The Spirit’s Touch,

this power absorbs the images, making them harder for
other beings with similar powers to access. Anyone attempting to use this power, Spirit’s Touch, or a similar
ability to see what the Kiasyd has seen finds that the
images are hard to hold, slipping through his mind’s
eye like minnows through a stream.
System: The player must make a Perception + Empathy roll. The difficulty is determined by the Storyteller based on the age of the impressions and the
mental and spiritual strength of the person who left
them. The number of successes determines the amount
of information gained, both in terms of images of the
scene when the object was being held or touched, and
the nature of the person who was holding the object.
One scene-type image and one aspect of the person’s
identity (Nature, Demeanor, aura, name, sex, or age)
becomes clear for each success the player garners on
the roll. Anyone attempting to use this power or The
Spirit’s Touch on the same object subsequently must
accumulate more successes than the Kiasyd did to get
any impression at all. The first Kiasyd’s successes subtract from the number of successes scored by anyone
trying to read the object thereafter.

•••• Chanjelin Ward
The vampire inscribes a ward on an object, a location, or a person. That ward disorients and befuddles
anyone that sees it, meaning that even if an intruder
can penetrate a Weirdling’s security and steal an object
of value, he’s unlikely to be able to find his way to the
exit. Spiteful Kiasyd use these wards as punishment —
one story tells of a Weirdling that drew a ward on an
enemy’s shirt as dawn approached, and then watched
(from safety) as the unfortunate vampire burned in the
sun, unable to remember which way to run.
System: The vampire creating the ward inscribes the
symbol in a visible location — on a library door, bookshelf, or an individual’s clothing — and the player rolls
Intelligence + Larceny (difficulty 7 for inanimate objects, or the subject’s current Willpower +2). Anyone
entering the warded area or touching the warded object loses two dice from her Intelligence dice pools as
long as she maintains contact with or proximity to the
ward. Additionally, anyone seeing the ward becomes
addled and lost unless she succeeds on a Wits + Investigation roll (difficulty 8). The Kiasyd is immune to his
own wards. The glyphs last for a duration indicated by
the number of successes on the Intelligence + Larceny
roll:

knowledge that they have been affected in this manner, though any attempts to harm them — by the Kiasyd or anyone else — return their wits to them immediately. Subjects have no access to their Knowledges
while this power is active, but Talents and most Skills
(those that work on muscle memory) are still present.
The Storyteller might need to exercise discretion as to
which Abilities are lost.

••••• The Riddle Phantastique
The Kiasyd whispers a riddle to an opponent, and
the riddle consumes his mind. The target can do nothing until he solves the riddle, and no one can help him
— answers provided by others, even correct answers,
fail to counteract this affliction.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Occult
(difficulty of the victim’s current Willpower). After a
successful roll, the victim can do nothing but sit and
ponder the Riddle until she accumulates three times
the riddler’s successes. The subject rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 8, plus or minus the number of derangements the victim has, at the Storyteller’s discretion).
She makes this roll as soon as she is told the Riddle,
and then once per hour until she has gathered enough
successes. Should the victim botch on a roll to solve
the Riddle, she takes one level of lethal damage as the
mystical enigma racks her body, and she loses all successes from the accumulated total. This damage cannot
be healed until the Riddle has been solved. The riddler
can end this trance by telling the victim the answer,
but no one else can.

••••• • Steal the Mind
Legends tell of the Fair Folk taking the memories and
faculties of their victims, leaving these hapless people
drooling idiots for the rest of their lives. While modern
thinking is that these stories actually referred to stroke
victims, elder Kiasyd display a power with a similar effect. The victim of Steal the Mind loses his memories
and all knowledge he has accumulated. The Kiasyd
gains these memories for a short time, and generally
uses this time to inscribe them before they revert to
the original owner… assuming the Weirdling lets that
happen.
System: The player selects a mortal or supernatural target and rolls Perception + Subterfuge (difficulty
equal to the target’s current Willpower). While the
Kiasyd has “stolen” her subject’s mind, she retains her
own consciousness, but has complete access to all of
the subject’s thoughts and memories. Subjects have no

456

Those who are victims of this power for long periods
of time may starve, though they will eat food presented
to them. The number of successes determines the duration of the effect, though the Kiasyd may return the
subject’s mind at any time before this period ends. If
the victim dies before the memories return, the Weirdling keeps them. If the Kiasyd kills the target to keep
his memory, the character may need to roll for degeneration (see p. 309) depending on what Path they follow — Kiasyd on Humanity must always roll.

••••• •• Absorb the Mind
This power, similar to Steal the Mind, allows the
vampire to absorb Abilities from her victim. These
traits are transferred permanently; the victim loses the
knowledge, and the Kindred gains it. Absorb the Mind
is an extremely invasive and insidious power, and fortunately only a bare handful of Kindred in the world
know of it.
System: The player rolls Perception + Empathy (difficulty equal to the target’s current Willpower). The
target may resist with a Willpower roll (difficulty equal
to the Kiasyd’s current Willpower). The difference between the two determines the effect. If the target gets
more successes, he resists completely and the Kiasyd
may never use Absorb the Mind on this target again.
The Kiasyd, if successful, may select a combination of
Abilities to her satisfaction.
Taking some of a victim’s Ability dots may leave a
remainder — the Kiasyd need not take all of a subject’s
dots in a given Ability. For example, a character with
three dots in Occult, from whom a Kiasyd steals one,
retains an Occult of 2. If a Kiasyd takes fewer dots than

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

she already has in a given Ability, these points do not
serve to raise her own rating. (In the previous example,
the Kiasyd would not increase his Occult rating if he
already had a rating of one or more, as he took only
one dot.) If the Kiasyd fails in an attempt to use this
power on a target, no subsequent attempt can be made
on that target for a year and a day.
In all cases, the maximum to which the Kiasyd can
raise an Ability is the level the target has in that Ability, so if a victim has only one dot in Law and the Kiasyd
gets 2 successes, she can’t gain 2 dots in Law. Generational restrictions do apply: a Sixth-Generation Kiasyd
can have a maximum of seven dots in an Ability, for
example. All losses of Abilities on the part of the victim are permanent, though they may be returned to
their original levels via experience-point expenditure.

••••• ••• The Grandest Trick
The Kiasyd can fool himself into believing that he is
not, and has never been, a vampire. This trick lasts for
a short time, during which the character gives up all
blessings (but loses all drawbacks) of being Kindred.
He retains all of his other knowledge, but the magic
of the Grandest Trick deftly prevents him from figuring out the truth (notes that explain the truth vanish, knowledge of clues that would lead him to it don’t
make sense, etc.). The Grandest Trick is useful for
throwing vampire hunters off a character’s scent, but
also for gathering information that can only be obtained during the day. Rumors among younger Kiasyd
also persist that some elders of the bloodline use the
Grandest Trick to meet during the day once every 50
years, exchanging documents and letters that, for that
day, make no sense to any of them. It is only after the
Trick wears off that they remember who they are and
can read what their Clanmates wrote.
System: The player spends eight blood points and
makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 9). If this roll is
successful, the character becomes mortal at the next
sunrise for a duration determined by the number of
successes on the roll. The Kiasyd knows, however sub-

liminally, the duration of the power, and he automatically attempts to return to safety, should daylight be a
problem at the power’s end. After this power ends, the
Kiasyd retains all memories of his brief return to the
world of mortals. During his time as a mortal, the character’s Traits are limited to ratings of 5 (which return
to their original levels when the character becomes a
vampire again), and the character has no access to her
Disciplines. Likewise, the character may not use blood
points for any vampiric benefits while mortal.

Obeah
The bloodline known in modern nights simply as
the Salubri is actually descendant of one half of the
ancient Clan. In bygone nights, one might have spoken of “healer” and “warrior” Salubri. In the modern
nights, the last vestiges of the warrior Salubri are the
antitribu of the Clan, and practice their Discipline of
Valeren (see p. 474). The rest of the bloodline know
the Discipline of Obeah. This Discipline allows the Salubri to judge and even improve a subject’s health. As
the vampire grows more powerful, Obeah lets her heal
a target’s soul directly. It is this power that forms the
basis of the “soulsucker” charge that dogs the bloodline
these nights.
This Discipline gives its practitioners a third eye in
the center of the vampire’s forehead when the Kindred
masters the second level of Obeah.

• Sense Vitality
With a touch, the Salubri can instantaneously read
a target’s injuries. She may learn how much damage a
target has incurred, and therefore make a guess at what
must be done to save him. This power can also be used
for diagnostic purposes — useful for a victim who can
no longer speak.
System: The Salubri must touch the target to see how
close to death she is. He must then make a Perception
+ Empathy roll (difficulty 7). One success on this roll
identifies a subject as a mortal, vampire, ghoul, or other

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

457

creature. Two successes reveal how many health levels
of damage the subject has suffered. Three successes tell
how full the subject’s blood pool is (if a vampire) or
how many blood points she has left in her system (if a
mortal or other blood-bearing form of life). Four successes reveal any diseases in the subject’s bloodstream.
A player may opt to learn the information yielded by
a lesser degree of success — for example, a player who
accumulates three successes may learn whether or not
a subject is a vampire as well as the contents of his
blood pool.
Alternately, each success on this roll allows the player
to ask the Storyteller one question about the subject’s
health or health levels. “Was he drugged?” or “Are his
wounds aggravated?” are valid questions, but “Did the
Sabbat do this?” or “What did the Lupine who attacked
him look like?” are not. The Salubri may use this power
on herself if she has injuries but has somehow lost the
memory of how the wounds were received.
Additionally, at the cost of one blood point, the Salubri may use Empathy for a roll instead of Medicine.

458

•• Anesthetic Touch
The vampire can ease a target’s pain or place him
into a deep, soothing sleep with nothing but a touch.
This power is intended to heal the pain or succor the
mind of willing targets, but the character can, with
some effort, employ the power against someone who
does not wish it.
System: If the subject is willing to undergo this
process, the player spends a blood point and makes a
Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to block the subject’s pain.
This allows the subject to ignore all wound penalties
for one turn per success. A second application of this
power may be made once the first one has expired, at
the cost of another blood point and another Willpower roll. If the subject is unwilling for some reason, the
player must make a contested Willpower roll against
the subject (difficulty 8).
To put a mortal to sleep, the same system applies.
The mortal sleeps for five to 10 hours — whatever his
normal sleep cycle is — and regains one temporary
Willpower point upon awakening. He sleeps peacefully and does not suffer nightmares or the effects of

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

any derangements while asleep. He may be awakened
normally (or violently).
Kindred, including the Salubri herself, are unaffected
by this power — their corpselike bodies are too tied to
death.

••• Corpore Sano
The Salubri can heal wounds with a laying-on of
hands. The subject feels a warm, tingling sensation
over the affected areas as pain leaves the body and
flesh knits. The vampire’s third eye opens during this
process.
System: This power works on any living or undead
creature, but the character must touch the actual injury (or the closest part of the victim’s body, in the case
of internal injuries). Each health level to be healed requires the expenditure of one blood point and one turn
of contact. Aggravated wounds may also be healed in
this manner, but the vampire must spend two blood
points instead of one for each aggravated health level.

•••• Shepherd’s Watch
The Salubri with this level of mastery of Obeah can
create an invisible barrier between those under his
care and those who would do them harm. The Salubri
himself must stand among his charges as he generates
this barrier; he cannot defend them from afar. Enemies
armed with guns or other ranged weapons can still attack, but none may approach closer than a few paces.
System: The player spends two Willpower points.
Erecting this barrier is a standard action, but maintaining it from turn to turn or dropping it is a reflexive
action. The invisible barrier extends to about a 3-yard/
meter radius from the character, and no one outside
that barrier may cross it while she maintains the power.
Those within it at its creation may leave and return,
however. The barrier moves with the Salubri. It cannot be maintained at a distance.
Those who wish to cross the barrier from the outside,
whether friendly or hostile, must best the character in
an extended, resisted Willpower roll (difficulty equals
the opponent’s current Willpower for the Salubri, and
the Salubri’s current Willpower for the opponent).
The opponent may cross the barrier as soon as he accumulates three more net successes than the Salubri.

••••• Mens Sana
With this power, the Salubri can heal madness, quieting inner demons and bringing a soul to peace. Indeed, ancient stories of the Salubri state that Saulot

used this power to bring sweet, if temporary, relief to
his “brother” Malkav. Other, more recent stories claim
that Saulot caused Malkav’s madness in the first place.
System: The player spends two blood points and
rolls Intelligence + Empathy (difficulty 8). The use of
Mens Sana takes at least 10 minutes of relatively uninterrupted conversation. Success cures the subject of
one derangement of the Salubri player’s choice. This
power cannot cure a Malkavian of his core derangement, though it alleviates its effects for the rest of the
scene. A botch inflicts the same derangement on the
Salubri for the rest of the scene. This power may not be
used by the Salubri to cure her own derangements.

••••• • Unburdening the Bestial Soul
This power is the leverage that the Tremere have
used for years to tarnish the Salubri’s name. The Warlocks claim that the Salubri use this power to remove
the souls of their victims, alter them in horrible ways,
or simply consume them and then make mindless slaves
from the blasted husks. The truth is that the Cyclops
use this power to rebuild a target’s tattered soul, at the
expense of their own mental fortitude.
The Salubri draws the subject’s soul out of his body,
and into the vampire’s third eye. There, the vampire
repairs the soul. During this time, the target’s body
is vacant, but alive. It obeys the Salubri’s commands
(and the vampire must command it to eat and drink,
or else it will starve — repairing the soul is not a quick
undertaking).
By a similar process, the character can cleanse a
person, place, or object of demonic or evil influence.
This isn’t a simple banishment, however. It is a battle,
pitting the Salubri’s moral and spiritual purity against
whatever malign entity is present. If the Salubri loses
the contest, she might lose her own soul in the process.
System: This power may be used to draw out the soul
of any character except those with Humanity or Path
ratings of 1 or 0 or those who follow particularly inhuman Paths of Enlightenment – some souls are beyond
redemption. The player rolls Stamina + Empathy (difficulty of 12 minus the subject’s Humanity or Path rating). A botch gives the Salubri the subject’s derangement for the remainder of the scene. The Salubri must
make eye contact with the subject and the subject must
be willing to be subjected to this power.
A soul drawn out in this manner becomes part of the
Salubri’s soul while the healing process takes place. She
may return it to its proper body at any time. While the

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

459

soul is within the Salubri, she may spend a permanent
Willpower point to restore a point to the subject’s Humanity or Path rating. The Salubri may restore a maximum number of points equal to her Empathy rating,
and may not raise the subject’s Humanity or Path higher than the sum of his relevant Virtues (for example, a
character subscribing to Humanity with Conscience 3
and Self-Control 3 could not have his Humanity raised
above 6 in this manner).
While a soul is being held by the Salubri, its body
is an empty husk, comatose or in torpor, with no motivating force within it. A soul whose body is killed
immediately vanishes, its disposition unknown to any
(although the Salubri strongly suspect that souls that
vanish in this manner are completely and irreversibly
destroyed). Killing the body of a drawn-out soul may
warrant a Conscience or Conviction roll if the killer
knows of the soul’s absence, at the Storyteller’s discretion.
If used to draw out a demon, the player spends a
Willpower point if the subject is willing and the corrupting agent does not resist (a rare occurrence). If the
subject is possessed by a conscious entity, the demon
(or other foreign consciousness) fights the Salubri for
dominance. This takes place via an extended, contested roll of the Salubri’s Humanity or Path versus the
opponent’s Willpower (each party’s difficulty is equal
to the other’s current Willpower). The winner is the
first one to achieve three net successes more than the
other. If the player fails, the attempt at purification
also fails. If the player botches, the demon takes over
the Salubri’s body. This purification cannot be used on
oneself and has no effect on the Beast or an alternate
personality.
Once the initial removal has been successfully performed, the player spends a second Willpower point.
The Salubri thrusts the demon into a nearby item,
animal, or person, trapping the demon in the selected
vessel. This must be accomplished within two turns of
the Purification and the target must be within physical
reach. If this cannot be accomplished, the demon is
likely to go free… or find another suitable vessel (such
as the Salubri). If the vampire places the demon in
a being who is likely to suffer from its presence, the
player must make an immediate Conscience or Conviction roll (difficulty 8) if the Storyteller believes that
the character’s morality would object. A botch, in addition to the normal consequences, releases the demon
into the world.

460

••••• •• Renewed Vigor
At this level of power, the Salubri no longer has to
repair a target’s body wound by wound. With a touch
and a moment’s concentration, she can restore the
body to full health.
System: The Salubri touches the target and spends
a full turn concentrating. The player spends a point of
Willpower. At the end of the turn, the target is healed
of all damage, including aggravated damage. If the
character attempts any other action but the laying of
hands during this turn, the Willpower point is lost and
no healing occurs. The Salubri can use this power on
herself.

••••• ••• Safe Passage
The Salubri radiates a non-threatening aura, altering
the minds of those around her to seem safe, pleasant,
and harmless. Crowds unconsciously part for her, pursuers lose interest, and passers-by are willing to provide
assistance. In the event that someone does attempt to
do her harm, the rest of the crowd may even protect
her.
System: This power is always activate, though the
Salubri can turn it off if she so desires. While Safe Passage is active, anyone in a crowd (defined as more than
10 people in close proximity) who wants to harm the
Salubri must engage in a contested Willpower roll with
the vampire’s player (difficulty 6). If the pursuer wins,
he may do as he wishes. If the vampire wins, her net
successes act as a dice pool penalty on any hostile action the pursuer chooses to take. This manifests as lost
interest in the vampire (the pursuers wonders why he is
chasing this person rather than doing something more
interesting).
Safe Passage can also assist a Salubri in finding help
or shelter. The player rolls Charisma + Expression difficulty 7). Each success reduces the difficulty of a subsequent, appropriate Social roll by one. This affects
only attempts to gain seemingly harmless or innocent
assistance, such as a place to stay or advice on the bad
parts of town — a Salubri won’t be able to get automatic weapons or low-grade heroin more easily with
this power. The effects of this power last until the next
sunrise. Safe Passage affects only those who know the
Salubri casually or not at all. Anyone who has known
her long enough to form an opinion of her cannot be
touched by this power.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

••••• •••• Unburden the Flesh-Clad Soul
Some few Salubri elders can (or could, at least)
achieve an understanding of the soul that allowed
them to free it from its fleshly confines. The character
allows a willing subject’s soul to fly free, able to explore
the world as an astral projection and transcend that
existence whenever it wishes.
System: The vampire and a willing subject must
both enter a deep meditative trance for a minimum
of one uninterrupted hour as the Salubri performs the
ritual necessary to separate soul from flesh without
damaging either. During this period, the player spends
a number of blood points equal to twice the permanent
Willpower of the subject. At the end of the ritual, the
subject’s body slips into a coma and dies by the end of
the night. Many Tremere and other cautious Kindred
warn that the Salubri may misrepresent themselves
and convince others to volunteer for a “release” from
mortal concerns, when in truth they wish to trap the
soul in another plane of existence.
The subject’s soul is released from her body and enters the astral plane (such as the Auspex power Psychic
Projection on p. 138). This separation is permanent
and irreversible. The subject is treated as an astrallyprojecting character in terms of rules mechanics. However, she no longer has a silver cord and no longer
needs one, as she exists independently of her body. If
she is reduced to zero Willpower through astral combat, she loses one point of permanent Willpower and
re-forms after a year and a day at the place where this
power was used upon her. A character reduced to zero
permanent Willpower is destroyed forever.
This power may only be used upon mortals (excluding mages) and vampires who are in Golconda, and
the subject must have a full understanding of what this
ritual entails — including its permanence and the impossibility of a reversal. The body of a vampire who is
Unbound decays at sunrise. It is possible to drink the
blood remaining in the vampire’s body, but no benefits
are gained from an attempt at diablerie. Any attempt
to Embrace the body of an Unbound mortal automatically fails. The free-flying soul may choose to dissipate,
moving on to whatever awaits beyond death, at any
time (and is therefore not a ghost).
The Salubri may use this power on herself, provided
she is in Golconda.

Ogham
The Ogham Discipline is only found among the Lhiannan bloodline; they do not (some say cannot) share
its secrets with those who do not suffer from their line’s
curse. All Lhiannan share a splinter of a dark, oncevast, and powerful forest spirit. Ogham allows them to
tap into that spirit’s power, and into its communion
with free spirits of its ilk.
Ogham is a limited form of blood magic; it is neither
as flexible nor as powerful as Tremere Thaumaturgy,
nor other Clans’ blood sorcery, but within the bounds
set by the Lhiannan’s territorial nature it is quite powerful. Ogham is strongest within a Lhiannan’s home
territory. More than 50 miles (80 km) from her home
territory, the difficulty of using Ogham increases by one
across the board, as the Lhiannan’s own spirit-shard
comes into conflict with unfamiliar local spirit life.

• Consecrate the Grove
The Lhiannan with this ability can use the power
of her blood to awaken the spirits of plant life in her
territory; they will act in her defense against any unwelcome intruder. Roots tangle feet, grass grasps at
boots, trees sway unnaturally in foes’ way, and so on.
Typically the Lhiannan slits a wrist and whirls in place,
or stabs a palm and walks a spiral pattern through the
foliage that she wishes to awaken.
System: The player spends from one to three blood
points, and the character must undertake the process
described above. One blood point rouses the plant life
in a 10-foot (3-meter) diameter; two blood points doubles that to 20 feet (6 meters); three makes it 40 feet
(12 meters). Tracing the desired area takes one turn
per blood point spent.
When the blood has been sown, the player rolls Charisma + Survival (difficulty 6). If the roll garners even
one success, the plant life animates as the local spirit
world is roused to action. Enemies in the area suffer a -2
to all dice pools from distraction and physical interference. Additionally, interlopers must make a Stamina
+ Athletics roll to avoid three dice of bashing damage
from the local flora (provided the local plant life is capable of such damage; trees and brambles probably are,
but a grassy meadow doesn’t contain the kind of flora
necessary for such an assault). Botching this roll causes
the plants to turn on the Lhiannan instead.
This power lasts for one scene.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

461

•• Crimson Woad
The Lhiannan traces mystical runes or script on her
own body in vitae, inviting spirits of war to infuse her
and gird her for battle. While so imbued, she ignores
many wounds and retains greater control of her mind
as the spirits direct her Beast. The Lhiannan can also
lash out at her enemies with a fierce, blood-borne attack.
System: The character spends one scene tracing
the woad on her body; this costs one blood point. The
player then rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 7).
Each success enables the character to ignore one die of
wound penalties from injury. It also subtracts one from
the difficulty to avoid frenzy or Rötschreck. This ability lasts through one scene. Additionally, if the character receives more than four health levels of damage,
the mystic inscriptions are ruined, and the spirits flee
her body.
The Lhiannan may also lash out at her enemies, adding the fury of the woad to her attack. The player may
add the number of successes achieved on the above roll
to the number of dice rolled for damage for a single
close-combat attack (this ability can only be used once
per application of Crimson Woad).

••• Inscribe the Curse
The Lhiannan inscribes the name of an enemy on
her body in vitae, in whatever language or set of symbols she likes. When the name is so inscribed and the
Lhiannan’s enemy can see it, baleful spirits become
bound to the name and enact a curse upon that enemy.
The curse takes effect the moment the victim sees his
name scrawled in blood.
System: The player spends three blood points. The
Lhiannan must write the foe’s name in blood, and it
must be displayed on a part of her body visible to intended target in order for Inscribe the Curse to take
effect. The player chooses which curse to enact on the
target from the list below; the curse takes effect as soon
as the target sees his name. He does not need to understand the language used, but if he can comprehend
it, he may resist the curse with a Wits + Occult roll
(difficulty 8).
The curses described below expire when the glyph is
erased, worn off, or defaced by the Lhiannan’s taking
four or more health levels of damage. The curse works
differently depending on where the Lhiannan inscribes
the target’s name.

462

Body: Inscribe the name on arms, legs, or belly. The
victim’s body becomes ill and weak (+2 to all difficulties on Physical rolls, and all wound penalties are
increased by one die) or, in the case of Cainites, the
victim cannot use blood other than the one point per
day necessary to remain active.
Mind: Inscribe the name across the forehead. The
foe becomes confused as parts of his mind become disconnected from one another; he must spend one Willpower point in order to attempt any Knowledge roll or
use any magical ability or Discipline (other than Celerity, Fortitude, or Potence). This Willpower doesn’t
buy him a success on that roll; it simply allows him to
make it.
Voice: Inscribe the name on the throat. The victim
loses the power of speech; he can grunt or moan, but
cannot say any words.
Soul: Inscribe the name down the sternum and over
the heart. The subject loses his will to resist the Beast:
difficulties to avoid frenzy are increased by two. Nonvampires are overcome by fear. The target must flee the
Lhiannan’s territory unless he succeeds in a Courage
roll (difficulty 8).

•••• Moon and Sun
The life of a Cainite is dominated by two celestial
bodies: the sun, which she must fear and hate; and the
moon, her only safe source of light. A Lhiannan can
trace ancient sigils of those two orbs on her body to
gain gifts – the spirit of the moon, ever the vampire’s
friend, blesses her by its current phase, while the sun’s
spirit wards off some of that orb’s fiery curse.
System: The player spends three blood points. The
Lhiannan inscribes the desired sigil on her body over
the course of 15 minutes. The sigil can be inscribed
anywhere, but must be exposed. The character may
choose to inscribe both the moon and the sun, but
each symbol requires the blood expenditure and 15
minutes to trace it. She can also inscribe these sigils on
any voluntary subject.
The sun emblem protects a vampire from the worst
effects of fire and sunlight. So long as the symbol remains on the character’s body, the player makes a
Stamina roll (difficulty 8) when afflicted by fire or sunlight. If the roll is successful, the damage is considered
lethal and the player may roll to soak it normally. This
roll must be made every time the character faces such
damage.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

The moon emblem adds one to the difficulties of SelfControl/Instinct rolls to avoid frenzy (but not Courage
rolls to avoid Rötschreck). Other effects of the moon
emblem depend on the current phase of the moon:
New Moon: Add one die to Dexterity and Stealth
dice pools.
Crescent Moon: Add one die to Wits and Occult dice
pools.
Half Moon: Add one die to Perception and Subterfuge dice pools.
Gibbous Moon: Add one die to Charisma and Expression dice pools.
Full Moon: Add one die to Strength and Brawl dice
pools.

••••• Drink Dry the Earth
The spirit within every Lhiannan is drawn to sites
of mystical energy, whether ancient stone circles, faerie rings, or dragon tracks. That spirit-shard can wrest
spiritual energy out of those places of power and use
it to aid the Lhiannan. A word of caution, however:
stealing too much power from any mystical site renders
it barren and lifeless, much as if the Cainite had consumed the very blood of the Earth. Also, wizards and
werewolves frequent these same sites, and destroying
these places can rouse their ire.
System: The player rolls Perception + Occult (difficulty 8). One success determines if a given location
is a suitable site (a decision generally left in the Storyteller’s hands, though a Lhiannan with a high Domain
Background may have such a site within her holdings).
Two or more successes on this roll grants a rough idea
of the site’s power on a scale of 1 to 5. If the character
wishes to tap the power of that location, she must spend
a scene and one blood point marking various parts of
the site with sigils of power, keys for her spirit-shard to
unlock the location’s energies.
Once the site is prepared, the player makes a second,
reflexive Perception + Occult roll (difficulty 7). Any
successes beyond the site’s power rating are ignored.
For each success, the player gains two dice, which she
may add to any dice pools (except those to avoid frenzy
or Rötschreck) for the remainder of the scene. These
dice are gone when used, but the character may tap the
same location again from turn to turn. The player must
make the Perception + Occult roll each time. Each
“drink” of the site’s energies depletes it, however, as
described below.

The Lhiannan’s spirit-shard is a greedy thing, wearing as it does the garb of a Cainite’s Beast, and drinks
the site’s energies recklessly. A Lhiannan can only garner a number of successes equal to 10 times the site’s
power rating, after which point the area turns into a
barren wasteland, incapable of sustaining life. This sort
of activity in particular is certain to attract the attention of Lupines or wizards. A site may replenish itself
over a period of years. However, a site that is tapped
with Drink Dry the Earth at any point during the year
is unable to replenish lost dice at all that year, and if
the site is completely drained, it is irrevocably dead.

••••• • Inscribe the Forgotten Names
When the Lhiannan reaches this level of Ogham,
she reverses the relationship between herself and her
spirit-shard and can dominate and extract information from it. The Lhiannan’s ancient spirit knows the
names of many mythical beings, and it can be bludgeoned into giving the Lhiannan one of those names
so that she may invoke such a creature. These beings
are dangerous, and not to be trifled with. Many are on
a par with Methuselahs.
Inscribe the Forgotten Names allows its wielder to
communicate with the being she summons, but it does
not give her domination or control over that creature.
She must appease it in whatever manner she can, and
hope that it does not take offense at being called up.
System: The player spends three blood points. The
Lhiannan must spend one half hour undisturbed as
blood oozes from her skin to sate the spirit-shard’s
hunger. At the end of this time, the player rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 9, or 8 if the character
has summoned this particular being before). If the roll
succeeds, a powerful creature arrives in the immediate
vicinity before the end of the current scene.
The Storyteller is free to assign game statistics to any
creature summoned. Such creatures have their own
desires and demands, and many do not take kindly to
being called.

Sanguinus
Sanguinus is the unwholesome Discipline granted
to the Blood Brothers by the Tzimisce who created
them. A curious relative of Vicissitude, Sanguinus allows vampires who practice it to combine parts of their
bodies, loan them out to others, and coordinate their
minds and appendages. Even low levels of it are unset-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

463

tling to watch. Use of the higher levels is disgusting,
indeed, as flesh parts and exposed organs, atrophied by
the Blood Brothers’ state of undeath, merge and pulse.
Mortals observing the spectacle of this Discipline’s
more obvious powers must make Courage rolls (difficulty 4), spend a point of Willpower, or flee the area
in nausea.

• Brother’s Blood
A circle of Blood Brothers is closer than any Sabbat pack, any blood-bound pair of vampiric lovers,
any ghoul family. The circle shares flesh, mind, and,
of course, blood. The members of the circle can spend
blood to heal each other’s bodies, no matter how far
apart they are.
System: The player spends a blood point, which may
be used to heal any member of the circle, regardless of
distance from the character. The Blood Brother may
also “bank” blood, spending five points to heal another’s aggravated wound over the course of several turns.
This power takes effect automatically; no roll is necessary. Blood spent by another Frankenstein does not
count against the maximum amount of vitae the target
character can spend per turn.

•• Octopod
The Blood Brother circle can donate limbs and organs to one another. This isn’t meant for healing after the battle, but for use during the battle. An opponent facing down the Blood Brothers might see one of
his opponents grow a second set of legs (making him
nearly impossible to knock down), another pair of arms
(meaning he can block or parry almost any incoming
attack), extra eyes for 360 degree vision, or an extra
mouth for an greater blood consumption. Of course,
the Frankenstein that gives up the organ might be left
a limbless, eyeless, mouthless lump of flesh on the side
of the battlefield, but the Blood Brothers never seem
to mind that.
System: The “donor” player spends a blood point for
each limb or organ he wishes to loan to the other circle
member. (Only the donor needs to have this level of
mastery of Sanguinus; the recipient may be any other
member of the donor’s circle.) The loaned organs appear at the end of that turn, in whatever location the
recipient wishes — eyes on the back of heads or on the
ends of hands have been seen, as have entire heads located between a Blood Brother’s legs. Use of this power
does not impart any extra attacks, but it may allow for
additional sensory input, more blood to be consumed

464

in a single turn, or extra hands to hold weapons or pin
down foes. Only external organs may be loaned in this
manner — hearts, stomachs, and brains cannot.

••• Gestalt
Blood Brothers share a hive-mind; this ability was
one of the guiding principles behind their creation.
The Gestalt power is that hive-mind, the ability of the
Frankensteins to coordinate silently and perfectly in
battle, to avoid mind-controlling powers, and to act
in unison.
System: This power confers several benefits on the
Blood Brothers. For this power to work, however, every
Blood Brother in the circle must spend a blood point.
If even one member cannot or will not spend a blood
point, this power fails. Once a Blood Brother has met
the Final Death, he is no longer a part of the circle, so
the power continues to function among the still-undead members of the group. Gestalt lasts for one scene.
While this power is active:
• Dominate, Presence, and the like take effect
against the highest Willpower rating in the circle. For
example, if a vampire attempts to Dominate a Blood
Brother under the influence of Gestalt, she must roll
against the highest Willpower rating any of the vampires in the circle possesses, even if her subject has the
lowest Willpower rating in the circle. Additionally, a
Blood Brother affected by powers in this manner drops
out of the Gestalt, though Gestalt remains active for
others. This mental “fuse” was supposedly created to
prevent the entire circle from being Dominated by a
vampire looking into the eyes of one Blood Brother.
• Perception difficulties for all Blood Brothers in the
circle decrease by three, as they share the sensory input
of other vampires in the circle.
• By taking no action other than concentrating, a
Blood Brother may “loan” an Ability to another brother. For example, a wounded vampire with Melee 4 may
step out of combat and loan a circle-mate with Melee
2 his mastery of that Skill. The “borrowing” vampire
makes Ability checks against the loaned Trait as if it
were his own.
• The Blood Brothers in the Gestalt may communicate through telepathy, allowing them to coordinate
actions. In game terms, only one initiative roll is made
for the circle, based on the character with the highest
initiative rating (see p. 271).
Not all Blood Brothers in the circle need to have
this level of Sanguinus to benefit from the Gestalt. If

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

a given character does not know this power, though,
the player rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 7) when the
power is enacted. If this roll fails, the character can
still receive loaned Abilities, but gains no other benefits from the Gestalt.

•••• Walk of Caine
The sorcerous theory behind the Blood Brothers
reads like a philosophical treatise on the nature of individuality, free will, and hematology. The Frankensteins are not a group of vampires but are one vampire
in several bodies, or so goes the theory. As such, any
of their characteristics must be viewed as a continuum
— they are not individually Twelfth, Eleventh, and
Thirteenth Generation, for example, but they are collectively Ninth Generation at any given time. While
the metaphysics of this kind of thinking makes most
vampires’ heads ache, there seems to be something to
it. A Blood Brother can draw strength from his circle,
lowering his Generation to allow for greater feats of
vitae expenditure.
System: Each member of the circle can “donate” one
step in Generation. In the example listed above, the
vampire of Eleventh Generation could take one step
from his two circle-mates and drop to Ninth, but the
vampire of Thirteenth Generation couldn’t drop lower
than Eleventh. No matter how big the circle, no Blood
Brother can drop to an effective Generation lower
than Fourth. Likewise, a Thirteenth Generation Blood
Brother can drop to an effective Generation of Fourteenth, which carries with it the penalties listed for the
Fourteenth Generation Flaw (p. 481). (He cannot go
to Fifteenth Generation, however.)
As with Gestalt, only one Blood Brother needs to
know this power in order to begin the process. Any
that don’t have Walk of Caine need to make a Stamina
+ Awareness roll (difficulty 7). If this roll fails, they
may not participate in the action.

••••• Coagulated Entity
The Blood Brothers merge into a fleshy, bleeding
mound of horror. This juggernaut surges forward, crushing and consuming anything in its path. The Sabbat
has learned to its chagrin that if the Blood Brothers are
not explicitly told to separate after using this power,
they won’t. This merger is, apparently, what the Blood
Brothers truly want.
System: Every vampire in the circle who wishes to
become part of the Coagulated Entity spends three

blood points. Three turns after the process begins, the
monster is complete and able to act. The vampire of
the lowest Generation who is part of the construct
guides the creature’s actions. The actual Generation of
the creature itself, however, is the highest Generation
of any vampire present in the construct, less one for
each additional vampire present in the construct. (Using the previous example, the Eleventh-Generation
vampire would be the guide but the highest Generation is 13, so the overall Entity would be 13 minus 2, or
Eleventh Generation.)
The creature’s Strength, Stamina, and Perception
are equal to the guide’s, with a +1 for every additional
vampire contained within. (Generational limits do not
apply to this creature — through sheer size, a Coagulated Entity may have a Strength of 7 or more.) All
physical actions undertaken by the monstrosity gain
one extra die to the pool for each vampire beyond
the first present in the construct (before splitting dice
pools).
Only one vampire in the circle needs to possess Sanguinus at Level Five for this power to work. Body parts
tend to shift during the creation of a Coagulated Entity — fanged maws at the ends of hands and eyes atop
fleshy stalks have been reported by terrified survivors.
Storytellers should feel free to give any bonuses (or
penalties) to the construct as they see fit.
A Coagulated Entity may not be staked, as it has
too many hearts in unconventional places for any but
the blindest luck to impale. It has a vampire’s normal
seven health levels, plus two for each additional vampire who becomes part of the entity (treat these extra
health levels as Bruised). The entity remains congealed
for one scene, unless the Storyteller wishes to rule that
no one told the Blood Brothers to separate.

Spiritus
The Discipline of Spiritus opens the vampire up to
worlds and vistas — and methods of feeding — that
most Kindred can never touch. Vampires are spiritually dead, unable to create life. The shamanic ritual
that created the Ahrimanes, though, allowed a spiritual connection between the undead and the vast, living
world all around them. While the vampire can barely
scratch the surface of what living shamans can accomplish, the Discipline of Spiritus is still formidable.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

• Aid from Spirits
Spirits are everywhere, but invisible to most living
(and unliving) beings. This power allows the vampire
to briefly rouse the spirit of an object, making that object perform its intended function better and more efficiently. It in no way makes the spirit well-disposed
toward the vampire — not that this usually matters to
the Ahrimane.
System: The character touches the object, and the
player spends a blood point and rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 6). If the roll succeeds, the player receives a
bonus to her dice pool using that item, equal to the number of successes rolled. For example, if the character uses
this power on a gun and the player rolls three successes,
she then receives a +3 to her next Firearms roll made with
that gun. Unused bonuses fade at the end of the scene,
and multiple uses of this power do not combine (the most
recent use trumps any previous uses). The character can,
however, use the power on multiple objects she uses in
the same scene, so long as she has the blood for it.

•• Summon Spirit Beasts
The vampire might not fully understand the link between “animal” and “animal-spirit,” but spirits of aggressive animals are usually more than willing to take
on a physical body and fight for the vampire. Spirits of
curious animals, meanwhile, seem to enjoy unlocking
doors or following people. With this power, the Ahrimane can summon up the spirit of an animal indigenous
to the area and send it to do what comes naturally.
The spirit assumes the corporeal form of the appropriate animal, and is capable of whatever the animal
would normally be able to do. The animal can follow
simple telepathic commands, and is slightly more intelligent than a normal animal would be (but still not
as intelligent as a person).
System: The animal summoned must be native to
the area — just because the local zoo hosts a tiger
doesn’t mean there are tiger-spirits running about. The
player must spend one blood point and roll Charisma
+ Animal Ken (difficulty 7). The number of successes
indicates how long the spirit remains material. The
spirits have the same number of health levels their
physical counterparts would normally have (see p. 388
for some sample animals traits). If they are reduced to
Incapacitated, they discorporate.

••• Aspect of the Beast
Instead of calling up animal spirits, the vampire
learns to emulate aspects of those spirits herself. In this
way, she can become faster, stronger, tougher, or gain
the special powers of nearly any animal, provided that
the spirit is local to the area.
System: The player spends a blood point and rolls
Manipulation + Occult (difficulty 7). The power lasts
for one turn per success, unless otherwise noted. Some
examples of aspects are given below, though the player
and Storyteller are welcome to make up others:
Beaver’s Bite — This makes the Ahrimane’s bite
strong and sharp enough to cut through almost any
substance (though it does no additional damage to living or unliving targets).
Chameleon’s Colors — The Ahrimane becomes capable of changing color to suit the environment (-2
difficulties to all Stealth rolls involving hiding).
Ears of the Hare — The Ahrimane can hear as well
as a rabbit, reducing the difficulty of Perception rolls
involving hearing by two.
Falcon’s Eye — The Ahrimane can see great distances as if she had the eyes of a falcon (-3 to all Perception
rolls involving vision).
Ferocity of the Cougar — All Courage rolls are made
at -2 difficulty.
Leapfrog — This grants the Ahrimane the ability to
leap three times the normal height and distance. (See
p. 260 for jumping rules.)
Nose of the Hound — The Ahrimane’s sense of smell
is far greater than that of a mortal. She can even track
by scent with on a Perception + Survival roll (difficulty
set by Storyteller).
Serpent’s Venom — The Ahrimane’s bite transmits
a venomous toxin that causes two health levels of
damage in living victims per turn (see “Poisons and
Drugs,” p. 301). The damage continues until the toxin
is removed or nullified, or until the Ahrimane’s spirit
power ends.
Sound of the Cricket — This grants the power to produce an annoying, grating sound loud enough to deafen
those nearby. The target suffers a +4 to all Perception

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

rolls related to hearing for the next scene unless he succeeds on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7).
Squirrel’s Balance — The Ahrimane can move about
in the branches and limbs of trees or across tightropes
with little fear of falling. All such Athletics rolls have
their difficulties decreased by two.
Strength of the Bear — This gives the Ahrimane two
extra dots of Strength.
Swiftness of the Stag — The Ahrimane can move at
twice her normal running speed.

•••• Engling Fury
Spirits abound — supposedly everything, from one’s
shirt to the very air, has one. The Ahrimane can take
those spirits into herself, break them down, and refresh
her own mental reserves. This destroys the spirit, but
no repercussions have been reported.
System: The player rolls Manipulation + Intimidation (difficulty 8). Every success allows her to regain a
point of Willpower, but each use of this power destroys
another spirit.

••••• The Wild Beast
The Ahrimane grows leaner, lithe, and strong. She
hunches over slightly, her eyes become slitted and catlike, and she grows vicious claws on her hands. Her
features become slightly feline, and in this form she is
an even more formidable predator than usual. Animals
react with fear to the Wild Beast, and mortals see her
as a monster — if they see her at all.
System: The change does not require a roll, but
the player must spend two blood points. The change
raises the vampire’s Strength by three, and Dexterity
and Stamina each by two. Appearance falls to 0 and
Manipulation is reduced by three. The vampire’s fangs
inflict an extra die of damage, and she grows claws that
inflict aggravated damage. The character can see in the
dark, and all difficulties involving scent, hearing, and
vision fall by two. The character can retain the Wild
Beast form for a number of hours every night equal to
her Willpower rating.

Temporis
The True Brujah bloodline claims a peculiar Discipline that allows them some control over the flow of
time. Masters of Temporis often grow ever more detached from the passage of ages. This, combined with
the natural tendency for Sages to grow emotionally

and spiritually distant, makes True Brujah elders exceptionally dangerous. They know that all life is finite,
and so they feel no compunction about ending it.

• Hourglass of the Mind
Masters of Temporis value patience and clarity. Time
is too complex and dangerous to manipulate incautiously or on a whim. Thus, the first power of Temporis
focuses entirely on perception and serves as a permanent alteration of a vampire’s senses.
System: Once purchased, this Discipline gives a
vampire a perfect sense of time. The vampire knows
events to the nearest second or better. Moreover, the
Cainite knows whenever the flow of time is mystically
disturbed by use of Celerity, greater levels of Temporis, mortal wizardry, or stranger things. Sensing disturbances is instinctive and reflexive, though it requires
a successful Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6
for most phenomena, as modified by the Storyteller for
distance and intensity).

•• Recurring Contemplation
A vampire with this power may trap a target’s mind
into reviewing a set of events over and over until interrupted. This power is extremely subtle and ill-suited
to combat or other situations rich in sensory stimuli.
However, a cunning vampire can trick a sentry into
reliving the tedium of his uneventful watch even as
the Cainite draws close enough to strike or slip past.
Other uses include the maddening infliction of déjà
vu to induce paranoia or make a victim question her
senses and her sanity.
System: The vampire concentrates on a single victim in his line of sight. The player rolls Manipulation + Occult (difficulty equal to the victim’s current
Willpower). With any successes, the victim falls into
a light trance and relives the most recent experiences
that preceded her fugue. Alternately, the vampire may
evoke another set of specific memories and circumstances from the victim’s past, provided that he has
some means of telepathically drawing them forth. The
recurring events must be relatively benign, insofar as
nothing noteworthy happens or nothing happens that
would demand the victim’s immediate action. Thus, in
the example of the sentry, the vampire could entrance
him and walk past unobserved, but not if the sentry
spotted him before invoking the power. Ordinarily,
the fugue lasts one minute per success. If the vampire’s
player spends a blood point to fuel this power, determine the trance’s duration according to the following
chart:

extra action provided – for example, one blood point
cancels a reduction to one half speed, two blood points
cancel one third, etc. Leaden Moment lasts one turn for
every two successes rolled, rounded up.

•••• Patience of the Norns

5+ successes one day
Entranced victims are oblivious to their surroundings
and the actual flow of time around them. However, the
fugue ends immediately if the victim suffers any damage or experiences a sudden jolt to her senses, such as a
thunderclap or even a gentle nudge. Normal conversation does not break the trance, although shouting does.

••• Leaden Moment
With this power, a vampire may begin to alter the flow
of time itself rather than mere perception of events. The
vampire gestures and slows the desired object almost to
a dead stop. This power can slow incoming bullets to
the pace of drifting clouds, or cause an enemy warrior to
see the battlefield quicken to a blur of dizzying carnage
even as his every motion slows to a crawl.
System: The player spends one blood point and rolls
Intelligence + Occult. The difficulty depends on the
size and nature of the target: a single thrown brick is
only difficulty 4, while a crazed ghoul has a difficulty
of 9. Targets larger than an adult human cannot be
affected with Leaden Moment. It is possible to affect
small, closely grouped inanimate objects of the same
nature as a single object, though this increases the difficulty by two or more at the Storyteller’s discretion (a
hail of bullets might be difficulty 9). This power may
be activated reflexively as a defensive action against
projectiles, but otherwise requires a full action on the
vampire’s initiative. Though failure carries no special
penalty apart from wasting blood, a botch means the
vampire mistakenly slows himself rather than the target, counting every 1 as a success for that purpose.
If the vampire succeeds, the object slows to one-half its
true speed. Every two successes beyond the first reduce
this speed by one additional factor, so three successes
slows the target to one third its speed, five successes
yields quarter speed, etc. The actual mechanics of such
slowing depend on the situation. For projectiles, multiply any successes to hit and final damage by the speed
factor, rounded down. Similarly apply the speed modifier to the successes of other actions involving Dexterity, Wits, or Strength for slowed characters. Characters
with Celerity may spend one blood point to negate one
factor of speed reduction at the expense of the usual

468

The vampire can now suspend an inanimate object in
time, keeping it frozen in perfect stasis as time passes at
normal speed around it. As with lesser Temporis powers, this stasis has both combat and non-combat applications. True Brujah warriors may halt bullets outright
rather than merely slowing their approach or casually
sidestep a collapsing building. Higher-level variations
on this power preserve precious scrolls and artifacts
without risk of mold or decay. If any solid object or
nontrivial volume of liquid touches a frozen object that
did not touch it at the moment of suspension, the item
re-enters time with the same properties and velocity
as when it stopped. Thus, touching a suspended object
with anything more substantial than a raindrop releases it exactly as it was before it stopped.
System: The player spends two blood points and rolls
Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 6). The vampire must
be able to perceive the object that he’s suspending, so
the player may need to make a Perception + Alertness
roll at a difficulty determined by the Storyteller in order to freeze fast-moving objects. If an object exceeds
the speed of mortal perception, superhuman perception such as Auspex is required in order to see and stop
it (as such, bullets can be stopped with this power, but
only if the vampire has at least a dot of Auspex). Objects frozen by this power remain halted according to
the number of successes rolled:

Suspended objects retain all energy in their suspension, releasing none to the outside universe. A suspended knife has no kinetic energy as far as the rest of
the world is concerned and hangs suspended in mid-air
until the power is interrupted or the duration expires.
Suspended alchemical or chemical processes also halt,
including fire. However, any physical contact more substantial than a falling raindrop breaks the suspension.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

••••• Clotho’s Gift
With this power, a vampire momentarily accelerates
time through himself. In this brief instant, he moves
with the preternatural speed of Celerity. Unlike that
Discipline, however, the time dilation of Clotho’s Gift
permits any type of action. A vampire may still move
or strike faster than the eye can see, but also think,
plan, and even invoke other Disciplines that require
full concentration. Only the last presents a danger, as
it overtaxes the vampire’s unliving stasis.
System: The player spends three blood points and
rolls Intelligence + Occult (difficulty 7). For a number
of turns equal to half the vampire’s Temporis rating,
rounded up, the character may take a number of extra actions at her full dice pool equal to the number
of successes rolled. These actions follow the timing
rules associated with Celerity, but may be used to take
any action. A vampire may use the actions granted by
Clotho’s Gift to activate Disciplines multiple times,
even Disciplines that cannot be used more than once
in a turn (such as Dominate or Thaumaturgy). However, for every action spent activating a Discipline, the
vampire suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage.
Only one important exception exists: Any attempt to
stack extra actions through Celerity, subsequent applications of Clotho’s Gift or other powers results in immediate Final Death, as the vampire collapses into ash
as though burned by the sun.

••••• • Kiss of Lachesis
True Brujah with this power gain limited mastery
over the physical age of objects and individuals. It
is a trivial matter to accelerate time in a compressed
rush, aging a target decades or even centuries in the
blink of an eye. It is far more difficult to absorb and
unweave entropy, lessening time’s hold. This power
does not reverse history in any way; it merely reverses
or accelerates the effects of time in terms of wear and
tear. Moreover, a target cannot regress to an earlier or
incomplete state of being. For inanimate objects, this
is the point at which they were assembled. For living
beings, it is either adult maturity or the time of birth
(or its equivalent). For the undead and other corpses,
it is the moment of death.
System: In order for the vampire to age a target, the
player spends two blood points and rolls Manipulation
+ Occult. The difficulty equals the target’s true physical age in decades or effective physical age in the case
of target’s that have aged unnaturally, such as by means
of this power. This difficulty cannot rise higher than 10

or drop below 4. The vampire touches the target and
concentrates for a turn. The Cainite may age the target
a maximum number of years as determined by the following table, although his player may choose to apply
a lesser effect. The Storyteller remains the final arbiter
of time’s effect on an object, but living beings aged past
their natural lifespan quickly perish.

Removing the effects of time requires greater effort,
increasing the difficulty of the activation roll by one.
In addition, the vampire suffers one level of unsoakable lethal damage for every success her player chooses
to apply. As noted, objects cannot return to an earlier
or incomplete state. A silver coin may lose its tarnish
and seem newly minted, but it will not revert to an
unformed block of metal. Likewise, while an adult may
revert to the cusp of his adulthood or a child to a newborn, neither could regress to a prenatal state. Also,
this power only accounts for damage and wear due to
time. A child amputee reverted to a baby will not regenerate her missing arm, nor will a broken sword become anything but finely crafted shards.
In either application, this power does not change a
subject’s mental or mystical properties. Sentient beings
retain all memories and any derangements. A vampire
regressed to the point of death remains a vampire, not
an inanimate corpse — and the regressed Cainite still
remembers all Disciplines and keeps any changes in
Generation due to diablerie. However, a vampire aged
far enough pales considerably or loses any signs of diablerie from his aura.

••••• •• Cheat the Fates
Where a vampire with Clotho’s Gift may accelerate
with respect to the world, a vampire with this power
may step outside of time entirely. During this brief sojourn, the Cainite perceives the world frozen at a standstill. He can walk about at a leisurely pace to sidestep
blows or retreat without being observed. He may even
exert force, such as by striking a blow, though no damage is resolved until he re-enters time. However, this
power wreaks terrible destruction on a vampire’s unliv-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

ing body. Used incautiously, a vampire may saunter out
of time, only to fall to ash when he returns.
System: The player spends one Willpower point and
three blood points, and then rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty 7). This power may be activated reflexively as
a defensive action; however, such hasty use reduces
the maximum duration to a single turn. Failure does
nothing apart from wasting effort and blood, while a
botch inflicts one level of aggravated damage for every
1 rolled.
If successful, the vampire steps out of time for a number of turns equal to the successes rolled (outside of
combat, a turn still only lasts three to five seconds for
the purposes of this power). These turns occur for the
vampire only while the rest of the world stands still.
He may take any action or actions during this time,
as many as desired, but he has no access to Disciplines
— even innate or perpetual Disciplines such as Potence. The vampire must direct every aspect of Caine’s
Curse toward holding back time. If the vampire attacks
someone in this state, the target cannot dodge or parry.
Resolve the attack normally but do not apply damage.
However, if the vampire suffers injury, such as by exposure to sunlight or walking through a frozen flame,
apply this damage immediately.
The vampire may end his sojourn at any point or wait
until the full duration of the power passes, at which
point time resumes. Before anything else happens, including resolution of damage inflicted by the vampire,
roll one die for every turn the vampire moved out of
time. The difficulty is equal to the vampire’s Temporis
rating. For every success, the Cainite suffers one level
of unsoakable aggravated damage. Apply this damage
concurrently with damage suffered by halted victims
and continue play on the same turn and initiative the
vampire stepped out of time.

••••• ••• Clio’s Kiss
One of the most subtle manifestations of Temporis’
higher levels, this power allows a vampire to reach into
the past and summon events, objects, or even individuals. Clio’s Kiss, named for the muse of history, is the
power to bypass the flow of time and bring something
— or someone — forward to the present. Some True
Brujah scholars use this to observe history as it truly
occurred, while others look to the past for aid or to
retrieve lost possessions. At least two coordinated attempts by the True Brujah to summon their Antediluvian progenitor have met with catastrophic failure.

470

No one knows if a Sage capable of this power remains.
The hope is that Clio’s Kiss faded from knowledge —
the bloodline cannot afford a third attempt.
System: The player spends half of the character’s
current blood pool, rounded up, and rolls Stamina +
Occult (difficulty 8). This power automatically fails
if the player spends fewer than five blood points. The
number of successes determines the maximum amount
of time through which the character may reach:
Successes
1 success

Time
24 hours

2 successes

one month

3 successes

one year

4 successes

10 years

5+ successes one century per success over 4
When a vampire uses this power successfully, the
scene she seeks to retrieve materializes around her,
briefly supplanting the current environment. This
change extends to a maximum volume of a ballroom or
similarly proportioned outdoor space (at Storyteller’s
discretion). The power affects everyone inside this area
by granting them awareness of the summoned events,
but the vampire is the only person who may choose to
interact with the scene (though he may remain invisible and disembodied). All others must remain incorporeal observers until time reasserts itself and the scene
fades. They may move about to change their vantage
point, but can take no other action.
If the vampire wants to remove an object or individual from the scene, bringing them forward to the present,
the player must spend a dot of Willpower. Once this is
done, the conjured scene fades away and present reality
returns. Only the summoned object or person remains.
This power can never alter the course of history in
any significant manner. Should an object or person
have a meaningful role yet to play at the time it is removed, the weight of time crashes upon the vampire
and he vanishes in its current. Whether such folly results in destruction or propels the vampire far into the
future remains unknown and likely unknowable. Likewise, any changes the vampire makes to a summoned
scene unravel as soon as he departs. Like a play, time
may be altered by the removal of extras, but the script
stays the same — however cruel a fate, Carthage must
be destroyed.
As always, the Storyteller remains the final judge
of what this power can achieve and need not reveal

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

all limitations until a vampire attempts a change. It
is possible to summon a person from a point close to
his death, assuming he perished without observers.
Likewise, a manuscript destroyed when the Library of
Alexandria burned can be called after it is last read.
Calling the very library from Alexandria would be impossible, not only for its size but also the necessity and
significance of its ruins. Finally, the previous form of a
currently existing object cannot be summoned, if only
because its continued existence validates a role in history. Storytellers need not consider every ramification
of paradox, but this power has tremendous potential
for abuse and should be adjudicated accordingly.

••••• •••• Tangle Atropos’ Hand
This manifestation of Temporis is at once the most
flagrant and subtle twist of time — the power of second
chances. The existence of such power is only a theory
and a fearfully whispered rumor, for who can ever know
when or how time itself unraveled and changed?
System: The player spends a dot of Willpower and
three blood points and rolls Wits + Occult (difficulty
8). Every additional point of permanent Willpower
spent beyond the first adds one automatic success to
the roll. Use of this power is reflexive and may be done
at any moment, even on a turn in which the vampire
has used other Disciplines. If successful, the Cainite’s
mind flashes back to his earlier self with full memory of
the events that transpired and now only might transpire.
This rewind encompasses one turn for every success
rolled, and inflicts an equal number of levels of unsoakable aggravated damage. Assuming the vampire does
nothing, every event plays out exactly as before. Once
the vampire takes a new action of any sort, time shifts
to encompass a new future and fate is no longer fixed.

Thanatosis
This Discipline is an exclusive development of the
Samedi bloodline, and it is tied intrinsically to the
Stiffs’ identity and history. Although Thanatosis appears to deal closely with death and the energies of
decay, no Giovanni have ever claimed mastery of this
power. Outsiders assume the Giovanni must be interested in learning this Discipline. However, the Giovanni view the Samedi with distrust and loathing,
while the Samedi take on the Giovanni is usually expressed by muttering a curse on the Clan and spitting
blood. Thus, the possibility of an exchange of information approaches nil.

• Hag’s Wrinkles
Perpetual rot makes the character’s flesh malleable.
The Samedi can open large folds in her flesh, storing
objects in them like a kangaroo’s pouch. She can also
massage the slimy flaps of fatty tissue to alter her appearance slightly (though this does nothing for the
smell). Other Kindred can learn this Discipline, of
course, but if they do not possess the “advantage” of
having skin that already falls in droops and folds, large
wrinkles and bulges may be visible.
System: This power requires one turn to shape the
wrinkles and the expenditure of a blood point. If the
power is used to distort a character’s features, the
Samedi player must roll Stamina + Subterfuge (difficulty 8). Success raises the difficulty to visually identify
the character by one and lasts for one hour per success
rolled. If the character is attempting to hide a small
object (a wallet, a letter, a small pistol), the roll and
duration are the same, but all rolls made to see if the
object is detected (for example, a pat-down search or a
security guard’s visual inspection) are at +2 difficulty.

•• Putrefaction
The character can, with a touch, inflict decay upon
a target. Hair falls out, teeth loosen, flesh rots and fungus grows on the skin. This power works on targets living and undead, and is obviously quite unsettling both
physically and psychologically.
System: This power first requires that the character
touch his intended target. The player then rolls Dexterity + Medicine (difficulty of the target’s Stamina +
Fortitude) and spends a blood point. Success inflicts
one health level of lethal damage on the target and
removes one point of the victim’s Appearance. This
Appearance loss returns to vampires at the rate of one
point per night, but is permanent for mortals (though
plastic surgery can correct mortals’ physical disfigurement). If a mortal suffers three or more health levels of
damage from repeated uses of this power in one scene,
gangrene or other ailments may occur.
Putrefaction can also be used on plants, in which
case the target becomes blighted and withered. It cannot, however, be used on inanimate objects such as
cars or wooden stakes.

••• Ashes to Ashes
The character collapses into a thick, sticky white
powder. While in this form, the character cannot move
and is only dimly aware of her surroundings, but is immune to fire and sunlight (meaning that this power is

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

471

an effective escape in some situations). The character
must take care, though — if the ashes are scattered, she
might never be able to reform.
System: The transformation to ashes requires one
turn and the expenditure of two blood points. While
the character is in ash form, the player must make a
Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 9) for any scene
in which she wishes her character to be aware of her
surroundings. Reforming from the heap of ashes takes
one turn. If the character is in a confined space (such
as an urn), she explodes from it in a suitably dramatic
manner as she brings herself back to full size. If a Samedi is scattered while in this form, one health level and
one blood point are lost for each tenth (roughly) of the
character that has been dissipated. Five blood points
are required to heal each health level lost in this manner. At the Storyteller’s discretion, the Samedi may be
missing limbs or vital organs (though never the head or
the heart) until the missing health levels are healed.

•••• Withering
The Stiff can shrivel and render useless an opponent’s limb. This power works on Kindred as well as
mortals. Kindred, of course, are horrified by the power,
as they tend to think of their bodies as immortal and
invulnerable to such ravages.
System: The Samedi must touch the limb he intends
to shrivel. The player spends a Willpower point and
rolls Manipulation + Medicine (difficulty equal to the
victim’s Stamina + Fortitude). Three successes are required for this power to shrink a limb. With one or two
successes, the victim takes one health level of bashing
damage, which may be soaked normally, but is otherwise unaffected. (If the Withering attempt is successful, the subject suffers no health level of damage, but
rather the withering of the limb itself.)
The effects of Withering fade after one night if a vampire or other supernatural creature is the victim, but mortals (including mages) are permanently afflicted unless
some type of supernatural healing is used. If this power
is used on an arm or leg, the limb instantly becomes useless. If this power is used on an opponent’s head, mortal
victims die instantly. Kindred lose two points from all
Mental Attributes while their heads are shrunken and
are unable to use any Disciplines except Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence. Multiple uses of this power on the
same appendage have no additional effect.

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

••••• Necrosis
A more horrific and potent form of Putrefaction, this
power causes flesh to decay and slough off, exposing
the bone beneath. Use of this power can render an opponent unable to move from lack of muscle tissue.

pressive as the Tzimisce Horrid Form, a clever Stiff can
find many tactical uses for such a power.

3 successes
		

Lose a point each of Appearance and
Dexterity

System: While a pile of ash, the Samedi remains fully
conscious and may use any Discipline powers that being
a pile of dust would permit (for instance, Majesty will
make the pile of dust very impressive, and no maid in
her right mind would dare sweep it up). The character
cannot be blown apart by high winds, and any deliberate attempt to separate the pile of ash may be resisted with a die pool equaling the character’s combined
Strength, Stamina, Potence, and Fortitude. The character may move voluntarily at a speed no higher than
that at which a pile of normal dust would be blown by
the wind, even if he is indoors. He does not have to
move in the direction of the prevailing air currents, and
may “flatten” himself by spreading his ashes thinly so
as to slip under doors and through cracks. This power
functions like Ashes to Ashes in all other respects.

4 successes
		

Lose a point each of Appearance,
Dexterity, and Strength

••••• ••• Putrescent Servitude

System: The Samedi must make contact with the
victim. The player spends two blood points and rolls
Dexterity + Medicine (difficulty of the target’s Stamina
+ Fortitude). The victim takes a number of health levels of lethal damage equal to the number of successes
rolled and suffers additional effects as listed below.
Successes
1 success

Effects
No additional effects

2 successes

Lose one point of Appearance

5+ successes Lose two points of Appearance and
		
one each of Dexterity and Strength
Attributes lost in this manner are regained when all
damage from the Necrosis attack is healed. If a victim
is reduced to zero Strength or Dexterity, he is unable
to move except for weak flailing and crawling but may
still use Disciplines and spend blood points normally.

••••• • Creeping Infection
Rumors state that Samedi, especially elders, are infectious, that their presence or touch causes a wasting disease. This power might be the source of these
rumors. Creeping Infection allows the Samedi to use
Putrefaction, Withering, or Necrosis, but prevent the
Discipline from taking effect until the Samedi is well
away. This power allows for subtle curses, or insurance
against someone who might hire the Samedi and then
refuse to pay up.
System: The player must successfully roll for a use
of Putrefaction, Withering, or Necrosis, as above, and
may delay the effect for a number of months equal to
the Samedi’s Stamina. The player may spend a blood
point at any time during this period in order to activate
the dormant power. If the Creeping Infection is not
used before the end of its duration, it fades away with
no effect.

••••• •• Dust to Dust
With this power, the Samedi retains cohesion, awareness, and mobility while in ash form. While not as im-

The practice of creating zombified servants is an old
one in vodoun, though most powerful Samedi can perform feats of reanimation that put the finest houngan
to shame. The Stiff can raise a recently dead person as
an undead servant. The zombie can’t think critically or
move faster than a quick walk, but it is tough, strong,
and unquestioningly loyal.
System: The first application of this power allows
the Samedi to feed some of her blood to a recently dead
corpse (maximum time since death equal to the Samedi’s Stamina in weeks) in order to animate it. Three
blood points must be spent to bring the corpse back to
a semblance of life. A reanimated corpse has the same
Physical Attributes as it did in life. It is capable of limited reasoning (reduce all Mental Attributes by one),
but free thought is beyond it and the only person it can
clearly understand is its master or an individual who
its master has directed it to obey. Reanimated corpses
possess two levels of Fortitude and three extra health
levels. They suffer no dice pool penalties from wounds
until they lose their last health level, at which point
they collapse and cannot be reanimated again.
A reanimated corpse crumbles to dust at the third
sunrise after its creation. Its “lifespan” can be extended
by feeding it more blood at creation — one blood point
per extra night.
This power can also be used on a mortal. The Samedi
creates a ghoul in the normal fashion, by feeding the
subject one blood point. The player then rolls Manipulation + Medicine (difficulty equal to the mortal’s perma-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

473

nent Willpower). Three or more successes are required
to turn the mortal into a zombie. If this roll succeeds,
the mortal loses all free will, becoming completely subjugated to the Samedi’s command. The mortal may try
to break free once per night by rolling his Willpower
(difficulty equal to the Samedi’s Manipulation + Leadership). If the mortal frees himself, he is still considered
a ghoul but regains his free will and normal Mental and
Social Attributes (see below). A mortal who botches
his Willpower roll or who becomes blood-bound to the
Samedi may never again attempt to break free.

•• Anesthetic Touch

A mortal under the influence of Putrescent Servitude
becomes pale and corpselike. He loses one point from
all Social and Mental Attributes (to a minimum value
of one). He gains three extra health levels and takes
no dice pool penalties from injuries until he reaches
Incapacitated, at which point he collapses. One more
lethal wound will kill him once he reaches this point.
The mortal also gains one level of Potence, as a normal
ghoul would, and has the potential to learn other Disciplines if the Samedi feels inclined to teach him.

The character’s hands bring searing pain, as though
the target is being burnt with red-hot metal. Although
the power does not inflict actual damage, prolonged
or repeated exposure can be enough to traumatize a
victim. This power works extremely well as a torture
method.

A ghoul zombie who goes a month without vampiric blood loses all benefits of being a ghoul, as would
normally occur. He also loses all effects of this power
and regains his free will, though he may still be bloodbound to his master.

The Salubri antitribu can ameliorate a subject’s pain,
allowing him to bolster a ghoul’s effectiveness in combat. This power can also put a mortal to sleep, which
has obvious applications for escaping human scrutiny
(though the Fury is probably just as likely to kill the
mortal in question).
System: This power works identically to the Obeah
power of the same name (p. 458).

••• Burning Touch

System: The vampire must touch his subject for this
power to take effect, and the effects diminish rapidly
after he removes his hand. The player spends at least
one blood point to activate this power, and each blood
point spent reduces the victim’s dice pools by two while
the Fury is in contact with the victim. This power is
often used for interrogation or torture, wearing down
the subject’s resistance and rendering him much more
tractable.

•••• Armor of Caine’s Fury

Valeren
Valeren is a warrior’s Discipline, a holdover from the
nights when warrior Salubri acted as noble fighters and
Kindred knights. The Discipline is still applicable to
the modern nights, but the Salubri antitribu put it to
decidedly more vicious ends.
Like Obeah, Valeren imparts its practitioners with
the fabled third eye of Saulot. The third eye appears at
the time the vampire masters the second level of Valeren. The precise nature and purpose of the eye are all
but unknown to vampires outside the Salubri antitribu.
Some suspect the eye grants them sight beyond sight,
while others venture that the eye allows them to see the
infernal taint in the non-Sabbat Salubri themselves.

The Salubri antitribu is surrounded by a shining,
crimson halo. This phantom armor protects the vampire against most physical injury, as well as against
Rötschreck.
System: The player spends one blood point and rolls
Stamina + Melee (difficulty 7). For each success, the
character gains one point of armor protection against
bashing and lethal damage, to a maximum of five points
of protection. Additionally, for every two successes
rolled, she gains an additional die to resist Rötschreck
from the effects of battle (but not fire or sunlight). This
power works for one scene.

••••• Vengeance of Samiel

A healer learns a subject’s illnesses to cure them. The
Salubri antitribu, however, learn how close to death a
target is so that they may hasten the process.

The Salubri antitribu strikes his foe with superhuman accuracy and strength, as his third eye opens and
changes to a furious, icy blue. Some Furies invoke the
names of ancient Salubri warriors, while others simply close their normal eyes and let Samiel guide their
hands.

System: This power works identically to the Obeah
power of the same name (p. 457).

System: This power costs three blood points. Any
single attack made by the vampire automatically hits

• Sense Vitality

474

CHAPTER TEN: BLOODLINES

the target as mystic forces guide the blow. Attacks
made in this manner may not be dodged, though they
may be blocked, parried, and soaked as normal. The
blow strikes as if the Salubri antitribu had succeeded
with all of his Dexterity + Melee or Brawling dice pool
(which makes for significant damage). This power may
be used only once per turn, and only then the Salubri
antitribu’s sole action is the attack. Additionally, this
power does not work for ranged weapons; only bare
hands or melee weapons.

••••• • Blissful Agony
The vampire may cause pain with a mere touch, as
per Burning Touch, but this pain lingers and swells
even after the Fury has removed her hand. It is believed that this power was originally used to acclimate
warrior Salubri to the pain they would experience in
battle, but among the Sabbat Salubri, Blissful Agony
has been turned to more brutal uses. If applied with
enough intensity, Blissful Agony can drive vampires to
the point of frenzy, incapacitate Lupines, and even kill
mortals outright.
System: The player makes a Willpower roll (difficulty 8) and spends a blood point. The power lasts for one
scene, though this duration may be prolonged if the
Salubri antitribu wishes by making a subsequent Willpower roll (though no additional blood points need be
spent). The character must touch her subject for the
power to take effect initially.
At the vampire’s option, she may cause actual physical damage to the victim at the rate of one health level
per blood point spent, though touch must be maintained for this to happen. Damage to vampires and
other supernatural creatures in this fashion vanishes at
the next sunset, but mortals must heal the damage normally. This damage is considered lethal damage, and
mortals may not soak it (though vampires and other
supernatural entities may).
To induce frenzy in a victim, the Fury must cause
damage in excess of the subject’s Willpower. At that
point, the subject must make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) or succumb to frenzy.

Visceratika
Visceratika is an extension of the Gargoyles’ natural
affinity for stone and earth. Certain Visceratika powers closely resemble some aspects of Protean and, to
a lesser extent, Vicissitude. Tremere in a position to

know insist that this is pure coincidence, but the few
among the Gargoyles who retain scholarly aspirations
insist that the Gangrel and Tzimisce blood used to create the bloodline still maintains a certain hold over its
members.
For many years, Visceratika was regarded as endemic
to the Gargoyle condition, just like the repulsive visage
and the wings with which other Kindred associate the
bloodline. That is, vampires — including the Tremere
— believed that they couldn’t have the one without
the others. Supposedly this isn’t true, and provided one
can find a Gargoyle tutor, any vampire can learn the
Discipline. Of course, that assumes one can find a willing tutor — the Gargoyles aren’t eager to reveal these
secrets. Furthermore, few Kindred want to bet that the
Tremere are wrong and risk waking up with wings and
horns.

• Skin of the Chameleon
This basic power has saved countless Gargoyles
breaching the Masquerade — and has allowed just as
many to ambush unsuspecting intruders. When Skin
of the Chameleon is in effect, the Gargoyle’s skin takes
on the color and texture of the surrounding environment. This coloration changes reflexively as long as
the Gargoyle maintains a walking pace or slower. More
rapid movement causes the Gargoyle’s appearance to
blur, negating the camouflaging effect. If this power is
used while the Gargoyle is in flight, his skin becomes
a reasonable facsimile of the night sky (though it will
not shift to mimic nearby skyscrapers or star patterns,
and a black silhouette against a brightly lit skyline is
likely to be noticed).
System: The player spends one blood point. For the
rest of the scene, the Gargoyle’s Stealth dice pool is increased by five. This power is subject to the limitations
described above. Any ground movement faster than a
walk negates this power’s effect, as does flight (at the
Storyteller’s discretion).

•• Scry the Hearthstone
The Gargoyles’ first function for the Tremere was
that of guardian and watchdog. This power allows
them to know instinctively where anyone is inside a
given structure. It even allows the Gargoyle to detect
characters concealed by magical means, if the Slave is
perceptive enough.
System: The player spends a Willpower point to activate this power, which remains in effect as long as the
Gargoyle is within or in contact with the target struc-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

475

ture, or until the next sunset. Scry the Hearthstone may
be used on anything up to the size of a cave complex, a
large theatre, a parking garage, or a mansion. The character gains an innate sense of the location and approximate size and physical condition of all living (or unliving) beings within the structure. To pinpoint a specific
individual’s location with this power, the player must
succeed in a Perception + Awareness roll (difficulty 6).
If the subject is attempting to hide, he may oppose this
roll with a roll of Wits + Stealth (difficulty 6).
Scry the Hearthstone may be used to detect the presence of characters who are under Obfuscate or similar powers. In this case, the Gargoyle only knows that
there is someone present — she cannot actually see the
individual in question. To determine the Gargoyle’s
ability to detect Obfuscated characters, compare the
relative levels of the Gargoyle’s Visceratika minus one
and the intruder’s Obfuscate as per the “Seeing the
Unseen” sidebar on p. 142.

••• Bond with the Mountain
The Gargoyle sinks into a stone surface, disappearing into the rock until he wishes to reappear. This
power allowed Gargoyles to invade their masters’ enemies’ strongholds, fight until sunrise, then meld with
the rocks or stone walls and reappear the next evening.
In modern nights, it can take the place of a haven for
itinerant Runaways. Unlike the Earth Meld power
(p. 199) which it resembles, Bond with the Mountain
does not conceal the Gargoyle completely. A faint outline of his body can be seen in the rock where he hides.
System: The player spends two blood points, and the
merge takes four turns to complete. This power functions in a fashion similar to the Protean 3 power of
Earth Meld, and may only be performed upon bare rock
or a similar substance. However, the Gargoyle does not
sink fully into the substance with which he merges,
and his outline can be detected within the stone with
a successful Perception + Alertness roll (difficulty 9).
A Gargoyle attacked while Bonded with the Mountain has triple his normal soak dice pool against all
forms of attack. However, if he sustains three or more
lethal health levels of damage from a single attack, he
is forced out of his bond and suffers disorientation similar to that experienced by an Earth Melded character
whose slumber is interrupted.

476

•••• Armor of Terra
At this level of Visceratika, the Gargoyle’s skin
hardens and becomes truly rock-like to the touch. The
Slave becomes harder to harm, even with fire, and
grows inured to injury. A non-Gargoyle learning this
level of Visceratika would find her skin becoming gray
and rock-like, putting lie to the claim that the Discipline doesn’t carry the risk of the Gargoyle’s curse.
System: This power is automatic and requires no roll;
it is always in effect. A vampire with Armor of Terra
has one extra soak die for all aggravated and lethal attacks and two for all bashing attacks, reduces all wound
penalties by one, and halves the damage dice pool of
any fire-based source of injury (this Discipline does not
change the rules for Rötschreck, however). The difficulty of all touch-based Perception rolls is increased by
two, due to the desensitization of the character’s skin.

••••• Flow Within the Mountain
The Gargoyle is no longer restricted to hiding within
stone. Now, he can flow through stone like lava working its way down a mountainside, emerging from the
hiding place at any point he wishes. Since this power
works on cement or concrete as well as rock, the streets
of a modern metropolis afford a Gargoyle some very
interesting assassination tools.
System: Once the character has used Bond with the
Mountain, the player spends two more blood points to
activate Flow Within the Mountain for the duration
of the scene. The Gargoyle can move within stone
and cement (otherwise using the same rules as the
Protean power Earth Control, p. 200). The character
can also use this power to walk through a stone wall
and emerge on the other side without first using Bond
with the Mountain. In this case, the player spends one
blood point and rolls Strength (difficulty 8; Potence
adds dice or successes normally). The Gargoyle may
flow through a maximum thickness in feet equal to the
number of successes rolled, or 30 times the number of
successes rolled in centimeters. If the wall or barrier is
thicker than this, the character is trapped within it until he is chiseled out or uses Flow Within the Mountain
to escape.

Merits and Flaws
Merits and Flaws are optional Traits that a Storyteller may choose to include, or prohibit, in her chronicle.
Properly used, Merits and Flaws help players create and
individualize their characters. Merits are special abilities or advantages that are rare or unique in the general
Kindred population, while Flaws are liabilities or disadvantages that pose challenges to a character’s nightly
existence. These Traits can provide player characters
with added depth and personality, but Storytellers
should be careful to ensure that any Traits chosen will
not adversely influence the course of the chronicle or
give one character an unfair advantage over the rest.
Merits and Flaws can be selected only during character creation and are purchased using freebie points
(although existing Merits and Flaws can be removed
or new ones added by the Storyteller during the course
of the chronicle). Each Merit has its own point cost,
while each Flaw has a point value which adds to the
amount of freebie points a player can spend during the
creation process. A character may take as many Merits as the player can afford, but no character may have
more than seven points’ worth of Flaws (which would

give a character a total of 22 freebie points to spend in
other areas).
Merits and Flaws are divided into four categories:
physical, mental, social and supernatural. The physical category describes Merits or Flaws that deal with
a character’s physical makeup or abilities, while the
mental category addresses intellectual abilities or patterns of behavior. The social category comprises relationships and status in Kindred or mortal society, while
supernatural Merits and Flaws concern the paranormal
abilities of vampires and the way they interact with the
physical world. Storytellers are encouraged to not only
restrict and disallow any Merits and Flaws that don’t fit
with their chronicles or for specific characters, but also
to create their own to reflect unique elements of their
games. Some example restrictions are given in the text
of each Merit and Flaw, but Storytellers can allow (or
disallow) any combination that don’t make sense for
their games.

Physical
Acute Sense (1pt. Merit)
One of your senses is exceptionally sharp, be it sight,
hearing, smell, touch, or taste. The difficulties for all

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

479

tasks involving the use of this particular sense are reduced by two. This Merit can be combined with the
Discipline of Auspex to produce superhuman sensory
acuity.

for Seduction, no for Intimidation, for example) when
a stranger is involved. This Merit only functions on a
first meeting.

Ambidextrous (1pt. Merit)

You look more hale and healthy in appearance than
other vampires, allowing you to blend with human society much more easily. You still retain the color of a
living mortal, and your skin feels only slightly cool to
the touch.

You have a high degree of off-hand dexterity and
can perform tasks with the “wrong” hand at no penalty. The rules for taking multiple actions still apply,
but you do not suffer a difficulty penalty if you use two
weapons or are forced to use your off hand.

Bruiser (1pt. Merit)
Your appearance is sufficiently thug-like to inspire
fear (or at least disquiet) in those who see you. While
you’re not necessarily ugly, you do radiate a quiet menace, to the point where people cross the street to avoid
passing near you. All Intimidation rolls against those
who have not demonstrated their physical superiority
to you are at -1 difficulty.

Catlike Balance (1pt. Merit)
You possess an innately perfect sense of balance.
Characters with this Merit reduce difficulties of all balance-related rolls (e.g., Dexterity + Athletics to walk
along a narrow ledge) by two.

Early Riser (1pt. Merit)
No one can explain it, but you seem to have the ability to work on less rest than your fellow vampires. You
always seem to be the first to rise and the last to go to
bed even if you’re been out until dawn. Your Humanity or Path score is considered to be 10 for purposes of
deciding when you rise each evening. Vampires with
this Merit cannot take the Deep Sleeper Flaw.

Eat Food (1pt. Merit)
You have the capacity to eat food and even savor its
taste. While you cannot derive any nourishment from
eating regular foods, this ability will serve you well in
pretending to be human. Of course, you can’t digest
what you eat, and there will be some point during the
evening when you have to heave it back up.

Friendly Face (1pt. Merit)
You have a face that reminds everyone of someone,
to the point where strangers are inclined to be wellinclined toward you because of it. The effect doesn’t
fade even if you explain the “mistake,” leaving you at
-1 difficulty on all appropriate Social-based rolls (yes

480

Blush of Health (2pt. Merit)

Enchanting Voice (2pt. Merit)
There is something about your voice that others
cannot ignore. When you command, they are cowed.
When you seduce, they swoon. Whether thundering,
soothing, persuading, or simply talking, your voice commands attention. The difficulties of all rolls involving
the use of the voice to persuade, charm, or command
are reduced by two.

Daredevil (3pt. Merit)
You are good at taking risks, and even better at surviving them. When attempting exceptionally risky
non-combat actions (such as leaping from one moving
car to another), characters with this Merit add an additional three dice to their rolls, and negate a single
botch die that may result from such a roll. Generally,
such actions must be at least difficulty 8 and have the
potential to inflict at least three health levels of damage if failed.

Efficient Digestion (3pt. Merit)
You are able to draw more than the usual amount
of nourishment from blood. When feeding, you gain
an additional point to your blood pool for every two
points of blood you consume. This does not allow you
to exceed your blood pool maximum.

Huge Size (4pt. Merit)
You are abnormally large in size, at least 6’10” and
300 pounds in weight (well over two meters tall and
over 130 kgs). Aside from making you extremely noticeable in public, this extra mass bestows an additional Bruised health level. Characters with this Merit may
also gain bonuses to push objects, open barred doors,
avoid being knocked down, etc.

Hard of Hearing (1pt. Flaw)
Your hearing is defective. The difficulties of any rolls
involving the use of hearing are increased by two.

APPENDIX

Short (1pt. Flaw)
You are well below average height — four and a half
feet (1.5 meters) tall or less. You have difficulty reaching or manipulating objects designed for normal adult
size, and your running speed is one-half that of an average human.

Smell of the Grave (1pt. Flaw)
You exude an odor of dampness and newly turned
earth, which no amount of scents or perfumes will
cover. Mortals in your immediate presence become
uncomfortable, so the difficulties of all Social rolls to
affect mortals increase by one.

Tic/Twitch (1pt. Flaw)
You have some sort of repetitive motion that you
make in times of stress, and it’s a dead giveaway as to
your identity. Examples include a nervous cough, constantly wringing your hands, cracking your knuckles,
and so on. It costs one Willpower to refrain from engaging in your tic.

Bad Sight (1 or 3pt. Flaw)
Your sight is defective. The difficulties of any die
rolls involving the use of your eyesight are increased by
two. As a one-point Flaw, this condition can be corrected with glasses or contacts; as a three-point Flaw,
the condition is too severe to be corrected.

Fourteenth Generation (2pt. Flaw)
You were created five or fewer years ago by a member of the Thirteenth Generation. Though you have
10 blood points in your body, only eight of them may
be used to heal wounds, power Disciplines, raise Attributes, etc. You can still use the final two blood points
for other purposes, though. The blood point costs of
nightly rising, creating and sustaining ghouls, and creating blood bonds remains the same as for other vampires. You cannot raise any Discipline above four dots.
Taking this Flaw precludes you from taking the Generation Background, and you may not start with Status,
either. You are likely a Clanless Caitiff, for your blood
is probably too thin to pass down the distinguishing
characteristics of a Clan. Most Fourteenth-Generation vampires should also take the Thin Blood Flaw
(p. 483).

Fifteenth Generation (4pt. Flaw)

Attributes. For these functions, you must expend two
blood points to obtain the effect a normal vampire
would achieve with one. (The cost for nightly rising
remains a single blood point.) What’s more, you cannot create or sustain ghouls, create a blood bond, or
sire a vampiric childe. You can use the remaining four
blood points to survive through the day and wake up
each night, nothing more.
You cannot raise any Discipline above three dots.
The weakening of the Curse of Caine has compensations, though (which distinguish this Flaw from the
Thin Blood Flaw itself). Sunlight does lethal damage
to you, instead of aggravated damage as it does to other
vampires. You can hold down mortal food and drink
for an hour or so; other vampires vomit immediately if
they try (unless they have the Eat Food Merit). Strangest of all, once in a while you might actually have a
child the normal, human way... though it will hardly
be a normal, human child.

Disfigured (2pt. Flaw)
A hideous disfigurement makes your appearance disturbing and memorable. The difficulties of all die rolls
relating to social interaction are increased by two. You
may not have an Appearance rating greater than 2.

Dulled Bite (2pt. Flaw)
For some reason your fangs never developed fully,
or they may not have manifested at all. When feeding, you need to find some other method of making
the blood flow. Failing that, you must achieve double
the normal number of successes in order to make your
bite penetrate properly. A number of Caitiff and highGeneration vampires often manifest this Flaw.

Infectious Bite (2pt. Flaw)
You may not automatically lick the wounds of your
feeding closed. In fact, your bites have a one in five
chance of becoming infected and causing mortal victims to become seriously ill. The precise nature of the
infection is determined by the Storyteller.

One Eye (2pt. Flaw)
You have only one eye — which eye is missing is up
to you. The difficulties of all Perception rolls involving
eyesight are increased by two, and the difficulties of all
die rolls requiring depth perception are increased by
one (this includes ranged combat).

Your vitae is so weak that only six of your 10 blood
points can be used for Disciplines, healing or raising

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

481

Vulnerability to Silver (2pt. Flaw)

Glowing Eyes (3pt. Flaw)

To you, silver is as painful and as deadly as the rays of
the sun. You suffer aggravated wounds from any silver
weapons (bullets, knives, etc.), and the mere touch of
silver objects discomfits you.

You have the stereotypical glowing eyes of vampire
legend, which gives you a -1 difficulty on Intimidation
rolls when you’re dealing with mortals. However, the
tradeoffs are many; you must constantly disguise your
condition (no, contacts don’t cut it); the glow impairs
your vision and puts you at +1 difficulty on all sightbased rolls (including the use of ranged weapons); and
the radiance emanating from your eye sockets makes
it difficult to hide (+2 difficulty to Stealth rolls) in the
dark.

Open Wound (2 or 4pt. Flaw)
You have one or more wounds that refuse to heal,
and which constantly drip blood. This slow leakage
costs you an extra blood point per evening (marked off
just before dawn), in addition to drawing attention to
you. If the wound is visible, you are at + 1 difficulty for
all Social-based rolls. For two points, the Flaw is simply
unsightly and has the basic effect mentioned above; for
four points the seeping wound is serious or disfiguring
and includes the effects of the Flaw Permanent Wound
(below).

Addiction (3pt. Flaw)
You suffer from an addiction to a substance, which
must now be present in the blood you drink (or you
automatically frenzy, as per the Prey Exclusion Flaw).
This can be alcohol, nicotine, hard drugs, or simply
adrenaline. This substance always impairs you in some
fashion (see “Poisons and Drugs,” p. 301, for particulars).

Child (3pt. Flaw)
You were a small child (between five and 10 years
old) at the time of your Embrace, leaving your Physical
Attributes underdeveloped and making it difficult to
interact with some aspects of mortal society. You may
not have more than two dots in Strength or Stamina
at character creation, except when raising Physical Attributes with blood points, and the difficulties of all die
rolls when attempting to direct or lead mortal adults
are increased by two. Characters with this Flaw should
also take the Short Flaw.

Deformity (3pt. Flaw)
You have some kind of deformity — a misshapen
limb, hunchback, or clubfoot, for example — which
affects your physical abilities and interactions with
others. A hunchback, for instance, would lower a character’s Dexterity by two dots and increase the difficulty
of die rolls relating to social skills by one. It is the responsibility of the Storyteller to determine the specific
effects of the deformity chosen.

482

Lame (3pt. Flaw)
Your legs are damaged, which prevents you from running or walking easily. You are forced to walk with a
cane or possibly leg braces, and you have a pronounced
limp to your stride. Your walking speed is one-quarter
that of a normal human, and running is impossible.

Lazy (3pt. Flaw)
You are simply lazy, avoiding anything that requires
effort on your part. Preferring to let others do the hard
work, you lounge around. For any action that requires
preparation, there’s a good chance you didn’t properly
prepare. Difficulty rolls for spontaneous Physical actions (including combat, unless it’s part of a planned
offensive) increase by one.

Monstrous (3pt. Flaw)
Your physical form was twisted during the Embrace,
and now reflects the Beast that rages inside you. Characters with this Flaw appear to be savage monsters and
have Appearance ratings of zero. Nosferatu and other
bloodlines whose weaknesses cause them to start off
with Appearance zero cannot take this Flaw.

Permanent Fangs (3pt. Flaw)
Your fangs do not retract, making it impossible for
you to hide your true nature. While some mortals may
think you’ve had your teeth filed or are wearing prosthetics, sooner or later you’re going to run into someone who knows what you truly are. You are also limited
to a maximum Appearance rating of 3.

Permanent Wound (3pt. Flaw)
You suffered injuries during your Embrace which your
transformation somehow failed to repair. At the beginning of each night, you rise from sleep at the Wounded

APPENDIX

health level, though this may be healed by spending
blood points.

Slow Healing (3pt. Flaw)
You have difficulty healing wounds. It requires two
blood points to heal one health level of bashing or lethal damage, and you heal one health level of aggravated damage every five days (plus the usual five blood
points and Willpower expenditure).

Disease Carrier (4pt. Flaw)
Your blood carries a lethal and highly contagious disease. The disease can be anything from rabies to HIV,
and Kindred who drink your blood have a 10% chance
of becoming a carrier as well. You must spend an extra
blood point each night on awakening, or you will begin
manifesting symptoms of the disease (increased chance
to frenzy for rabies, reduced soak rolls for HIV, etc.).

Deaf (4pt. Flaw)
You cannot hear. While you may be more resistant
to some applications of Dominate, you also may not
listen to electronic or vocal media, and the difficulties
of many Perception rolls are increased by three.

Mute (4pt. Flaw)
You cannot speak. You may communicate with the
Storyteller and describe your actions, but cannot talk
to player or Storyteller characters unless everyone
concerned purchases a commonly understood sign
language (via the Language Merit) or you write down
what you wish to say.

Thin Blood (4pt. Flaw)
Your blood is thin, weak, and does not sustain you
well. All blood point costs are doubled (e.g., using
blood-related Disciplines or healing damage), although
you only lose one blood upon rising in the evening.
Furthermore, you are unable to create a blood bond,
and efforts to sire other vampires succeed only one in
five times.

Flesh of the Corpse (5pt. Flaw)
Your flesh does not fully regenerate itself once it is
damaged. While you are able to heal yourself to the
point of regaining full functionality, your skin still
retains the cuts, tears, bullet holes, and other visible
damage that you have incurred. Depending on the nature of the damage, this Flaw will make social dealings
exceedingly difficult, and may decrease your Appearance dots over time (even to 0).

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

483

Infertile Vitae (5pt. Flaw)
During your Embrace, something went horribly
wrong, causing your blood to mutate under the stress
of dying and rising again. All those you try to Embrace
die. No matter what you do, you may not create any
childer. However, your blood can still be used in blood
rituals like Thaumaturgy and the Vaulderie, or for any
other vampiric needs like making ghouls.

Blind (6pt. Flaw)
You cannot see. Characters can compensate for the
loss of vision by becoming more attuned to other sensory input, but visual cues and images are lost to them.
Difficulties of all Dexterity-based rolls are increased by
two. Oddly, vampires with Aura Perception (Auspex
2) are still able to use this ability, thought the information is interpreted via the other senses. On the other
hand, vampires who need make eye contact to enact
powers like Dominate against you are only at a penalty
to do so (see the sidebar on p. 152).

Mental
Coldly Logical (1pt. Merit)
While some might refer to you as a “cold fish,” you
have a knack for separating factual reporting from emotional or hysterical coloration. You may or may not be
emotional yourself, but you can see clearly when others
are clouding the facts with their feelings (-1 difficulty
on all related rolls).

Common Sense (1pt. Merit)
You have a significant amount of practical, everyday wisdom. Whenever you are about to act in a way
contrary to common sense, the Storyteller can make
suggestions or warnings about the implications of said
action. This is a very useful Merit for beginning players
unfamiliar with the game.

Concentration (1pt. Merit)
You have the ability to focus your mind and shut out
any distractions or annoyances. Characters with this
Merit are unaffected by any penalties stemming from
distracting circumstances (e.g., loud noises, strobe
lights, or hanging upside down).

Introspection (1pt. Merit)
You have keen insight into the ulterior motives of all
your actions. Through this nightly exercise, you also
have incredible insight into the underlying motives of

484

others’ actions. Add two dice to your Perception dice
pool when you must take an action against someone
with the same Nature or Demeanor as you.

Language (1pt. Merit)
You know a language in addition to your native one.
You can take this Merit multiple times, each reflecting
a different language.

Time Sense (1pt. Merit)
You have an innate sense of time and are able to estimate the passage of time accurately without using a
watch or other mechanical device.

Useful Knowledge (1pt. Merit)
You have expertise in a specific field that makes your
conversation intriguing to an older Kindred. So long
as your knowledge holds the other vampire’s attention,
he has a vested interest in keeping you around. Then
again, once he’s pumped you for every iota of information you possess, that patronage may suddenly vanish.
(Note: This Merit should be played like a 1-dot Mentor with a specific interest. However, unlike a Mentor,
Useful Knowledge does not imply a permanent relationship.)

Code of Honor (2pt. Merit)
You have a personal code of ethics to which you adhere. The specifics of this code must be worked out with
the Storyteller prior to play, and the character must
follow it strictly. Characters with this Merit gain two
additional dice to all Willpower or Virtue rolls when
acting in accordance with their code (e.g., defending
the helpless) or when attempting to avoid situations
that might force them to violate their code.

Computer Aptitude (2pt. Merit)
You are familiar with and talented in the uses of
computer equipment. Other Kindred may not understand computers, but to you they are intuitive. All rolls
involving computers are at -2 difficulty for you.

Eidetic Memory (2pt. Merit)
You remember, with perfect detail, things you see and
hear. Documents, photographs, conversations, etc.,
can be committed to memory with only minor concentration. Under stressful conditions involving numerous
distractions, you must make a Perception + Alertness
roll (difficulty 6) to summon enough concentration to
absorb what your senses detect.

APPENDIX

Light Sleeper (2pt. Merit)

Nightmares (1pt. Flaw)

You can awaken instantly at any sign of trouble or
danger, and do so without any sleepiness or hesitation.
You may ignore rules regarding how Humanity or your
morality Path restricts the number of dice available
during the day.

You experience horrendous nightmares every time
you sleep, and memories of them haunt you during
your waking hours. Upon awakening, you must make
a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) or lose a die on all actions for that night. A botched Willpower roll indicates that, even when awake, you still believe that you
are locked in a nightmare.

Natural Linguist (2pt. Merit)
You have a flair for languages. You may add three dice
to any dice pool involving written or spoken languages, and each purchase of the Language Merit (previous
page) gives you two languages instead of just one.

Calm Heart (3pt. Merit)
You are naturally calm and do not easily fly off the
handle. You receive two extra dice when attempting to
resist a frenzy. Brujah may not take this Merit.

Iron Will (3pt. Merit)
When you are determined and your mind is set, nothing can thwart you from your goals. Characters using
Dementation, Dominate, or any other mind-altering
magic, spell, or Thaumaturgy path against your character are at +3 difficulty.
Elder levels of powers like Dementation and Dominate may overwhelm even this resistance. Against
Level Six powers, the expenditure of a Willpower point
through Iron Will only raises the difficulty of the Discipline roll by two. Against Level Seven powers, the difficulty is increased by only one. Level Eight and higher
powers cannot be resisted with Iron Will.
This Merit does not affect Presence or other powers
dealing with the emotions. Characters will Willpower
scores below 8 cannot take this Merit.

Precocious (3pt. Merit)
You learn quickly. The time for you to pick up a particular Ability (or Abilities, at Storyteller discretion) is
cut in half, as is the experience cost.

Prey Exclusion (1pt. Flaw)
You refuse to hunt a certain class of prey. You might
refuse to feed on drug dealers, policemen, accountants,
or rich people — if you accidentally feed upon such
an individual, you automatically frenzy and must make
a roll to prevent Humanity or Path loss (difficulty 7).
Witnessing other Kindred feeding on the object of
your exclusion might also provoke a frenzy, at the Storyteller’s discretion. Ventrue, owing to the limitations
already imposed on their feeding by their Clan weakness, may not take this Flaw.

Shy (1pt. Flaw)
You are distinctly ill at ease when dealing with people and try to avoid social situations whenever possible. Difficulties for all rolls involving social interaction
with strangers are increased by two. If the character
becomes the center of attention in a large group, difficulties are increased by three.

Soft-Hearted (1pt. Flaw)
You cannot stand to watch others suffer. You avoid
any situation that involves causing someone physical
or emotional pain, unless you make a Willpower roll
(difficulty 8). You must have a Humanity rating of 7
or above to take this Flaw — vampires on Paths of Enlightenment can only take this Flaw with Storyteller
approval.

Speech Impediment (1pt. Flaw)

When you sleep, it is very difficult for you to awaken.
The difficulty of any roll to awaken during the day is
increased by two.

You have a stammer or other speech impediment
that hampers verbal communication. The difficulties
of all die rolls involving verbal communication are increased by two. This Flaw must be roleplayed whenever possible.

Impatient (1pt. Flaw)

Unconvinced (1pt. Flaw)

Deep Sleeper (1pt. Flaw)

You have no patience for standing around and waiting. You want to do things now — fuck those slowpokes
trying to hold you back. Every time you are forced to
wait around instead of acting, a Self-Control roll is required to see if you go tearing off on your own instead.

You fail to see the need for the core ideologies of
your Sect or Clan, and have gone on record as saying
so. Taking your stand has made you suspect in the eyes
of your superiors, and may have attracted the attention
of your enemies as well.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

485

Amnesia (2pt. Flaw)

Vengeful (2pt. Flaw)

You are unable to remember anything about your
past, yourself, or your family (whether mortal or vampiric), though your past might well come back to haunt
you. Your origins and the circumstances behind your
amnesia are for the Storyteller to determine, and she is
encouraged to make it as interesting as possible.

You have a score to settle, incurred either during
your mortal days or after the Embrace. You are obsessed
with taking your revenge on an individual or group,
and it is your overriding priority in any situation where
you encounter the object of your revenge. You may
temporarily resist your need for vengeance by spending
a Willpower point.

Lunacy (2pt. Flaw)
You are affected by the phases of the moon, increasing your chances to frenzy. Under the crescent moon,
difficulties to avoid frenzy increase by one. Under the
half or gibbous moon, difficulties rise by two. When
the moon is full, difficulties increase by three.

Phobia (2pt. Flaw)
You have an overpowering fear of something. Spiders, snakes, crowds, and heights are examples of common phobias. You must make a Courage roll every time
you encounter the object of your fear. The difficulty of
the roll is determined by the Storyteller. If you fail the
roll, you must retreat from the object.

Short Fuse (2pt. Flaw)
You are easily angered. Difficulties to avoid frenzy are
two greater. Brujah vampires cannot take this Flaw, as
they already suffer from a similar weakness.

Stereotype (2pt. Flaw)
You buy heavily into all of the vampire stories you’ve
read and heard. You wear a cape or body glitter, speak
with an accent, and otherwise act in a cartoonish fashion. Such behavior is embarrassing in the extreme to
other Kindred, who are likely to ostracize or mock you
(+2 difficulty to Social rolls with other vampires who
don’t share your habits). You also stand out to hunters.

Territorial (2pt. Flaw)
You are extremely territorial, staking out a particular
area as your hunting ground and reacting aggressively
to trespassers. If another vampire enters your territory
uninvited, you must make a frenzy roll. If you fail, you
immediately attack the interloper and continue attacking until the intruder is dead or has left your hunting grounds. You are reluctant to leave your territory
except in desperate circumstances.

Thirst for Innocence (2pt. Flaw)
The sight of innocence — of any sort — arouses in
you a terrible bloodlust. Roll Self-Control or Instincts,
or else frenzy and attack the source of your hunger.

486

Victim of the Masquerade (2pt. Flaw)
The Camarilla’s propaganda machine did too good a
job on you. Even after your Embrace you refused to believe you were a vampire. You remain convinced that
there is some logical explanation for your condition,
and spend as much time as you can searching for it.
You also have problems feeding, and may insist on trying to eat regular food. None of these habits makes you
particularly pleasant company for other Kindred. This
Flaw must be roleplayed at all times, and is generally
taken by Camarilla vampires.

Weak-Willed (3pt. Flaw)
You are highly susceptible to Dominate and intimidation by others; Dominate attempts automatically affect
you unless the Discipline wielder is of higher Generation, and your difficulties to resist Social abilities such
as Intimidation or Leadership, as well as mind-altering
spells or magic, are increased by two. Your Willpower
Trait may never rise above 4.

Conspicuous Consumption (4pt. Flaw)
It is not enough for you to draw nourishment from
the blood of mortals — you believe you must also consume your victim’s heart, liver, and other blood-rich
tissue. Of course, this will necessitate the deaths of all
of your victims (unless you are extremely creative),
which might lead to numerous problems with maintaining Humanity (and a low profile). Characters with
this Flaw should additionally purchase the Eat Food
Merit.

Guilt-Wracked (4pt. Flaw)
You simply cannot come to grips with the fact that
you must drink blood to survive. You suffer horrible
guilt over each time you feed (roll Conscience, difficulty 7, or else frenzy every time you feed — characters
with the Conviction Virtue cannot take this Flaw) and
try to avoid doing so as much as possible. This means
that you rarely have much blood in your system, leaving you vulnerable to both attacks and hunger-based
frenzies.

APPENDIX

Flashbacks (6pt. Flaw)
You managed to make it through the Creation Rites or
other similarly traumatic experience, but not wholly intact. The most insignificant thing can throw you into a
different mood or state of mind, and as such your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your precarious
emotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of each story, make a Willpower roll (you may not
spend Willpower for an automatic success). If you succeed,
you may participate in the story as normal. If you fail, however, your Willpower score is considered to be 1 for the
duration of that session, and you only have one Willpower
point to spend. You may roll again at the beginning of the
next session to see if you regain your Willpower.

Social
Elysium Regular (1pt. Merit)
You spend an unusual amount of time in Elysium.
You see and are seen to such an extent that all of the
movers and shakers of Elysium at least know who you
are. Extended time spent in Elysium also gives you extended opportunities to interact with the Harpies and
other Kindred of that stature — and they’ll know your
name when you approach them. This Merit is generally taken by vampires that respect and attend Elysium
on a regular basis.

Former Ghoul (1pt. Merit)
You were introduced to the Blood long before you
were made Kindred. Your long experience as a ghoul
gives you insight into and comfort with vampiric society. You are at -1 difficulty on all Social rolls when in
the presence of other neonates (particularly those who
haven’t been educated by their sires), and have a -1
difficulty on all rolls relating to vampiric knowledge.

Harmless (1pt. Merit)
Everyone in the city knows you, and knows that
you’re no threat to their plans. While that sort of estimation may seem insulting, it’s also what’s kept you
from being killed. No one considers you worth their
time to deal with, and that low opinion keeps you safe.
If you start acting in a way that demonstrates that you
are no longer harmless, others’ reactions to you will
likely change as a result.

Natural Leader (1pt. Merit)
You are gifted with a certain magnetism to which
others naturally defer. You receive two extra dice when

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

487

making Leadership rolls. You must have a Charisma
rating of 3 or greater to purchase this Merit.

Prestigious Sire (1pt. Merit)
Your sire has or had great status in her Sect or Clan,
and this has accorded you a certain amount of prestige. Though your sire may no longer have any dealings
with you, the simple fact of your ancestry has marked
you forever. This prestige might aid you greatly in dealings with other vampires, or it might engender jealousy
or contempt.

Protégé (1pt. Merit)
Your sire watched you for some time before Embracing you, and spoke glowingly of you to acquaintances.
These vampires may be inclined to look favorably on
you by dint of your sire’s recommendation; you are at
-1 difficulty on Social rolls with all those who’ve heard
good things about you.

Rep (1pt. Merit)
Your fame has exceeded the bounds of your Sect. Everyone knows who you are, what you’ve done and what
you’re supposed to have done (which might not be the
same thing). The publicity can be good or bad; what
matters is that everybody knows your name. Whether individuals outside of your immediate social circle
know enough to match your face to your name is a different matter.

Sabbat Survivor (1pt. Merit)
You’ve lived through at least one Sabbat attack or
attempted recruitment. Your experience helps you
anticipate situations where you might potentially
be endangered by the Sabbat once again. You are at
-1 difficulty on all Perception rolls when it comes to
Sabbat-based matters. This Merit is generally taken by
groups in conflict with the Sabbat, and comes into play
most frequently as a means of avoiding ambushes.

Boon (1-6pt. Merit)
Someone owes you a favor. The vampire in your debt
might be the lowliest neonate in the city or might be
the Prince herself; it all depends on how many points
the Merit costs. You only have that single favor owed
you (unless you take the Merit multiple times), so using it properly is of paramount importance. Depending
on status and other factors, the vampire who owes you
a favor may well resent his debt, and might go out of
his way to “settle” it early — even going so far as to
create situations from which he must “rescue” you and
thus clear the slate.

488

Bullyboy (2pt. Merit)
You’re part of the brute squad the local Sheriff or
Bishop calls on when he needs some muscle. As a
result, you get in on action that others miss entirely,
score points with those in power, and occasionally get
a chance to act outside of the law. How far outside
the law you can go depends on circumstance and how
much the vampire you report to likes you.

Old Pal (2pt. Merit)
An acquaintance from your breathing days was Embraced at the same time you were. Fortunately, your
friendship has endured even death and unlife, and you
find a constant source of support and aid in your old
friend. She expects the same of you, which isn’t always
convenient, but at least you each have someone to
hang onto who remembers the good old nights — and
days. The Storyteller should play the Old Pal as a very
loyal Ally.

Lawman’s Friend (2pt. Merit)
For whatever reason (maybe your winning smile or
perhaps just your superb groveling technique), the local Sheriff or Bishop in charge of discipline likes you.
He’s inclined to overlook your minor trespasses and let
you in on things you’re not supposed to know about.
He even gives you warnings about occasional crackdowns and times when the higher-ups aren’t feeling
generous. Of course, abusing this connection might
well turn a friendly vampire into an enemy — and the
change might not be apparent until it’s too late.

Open Road (2pt. Merit)
Unlike many Kindred, you like to travel. You have
a solid knowledge of safe travel routes and methodologies, not to mention haven space available in any number of destinations. Unless someone out there knows
your exact route and is specifically looking for you, you
can move between cities unimpeded by random encounters with Lupines, overzealous state troopers, and
the like.

Sanctity (2pt. Merit)
This Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone considers you pure and innocent, though not
necessarily naïve. You have a saint-like quality that is
hard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. You are trusted, even if you are not trustworthy. At the Storyteller’s
discretion, you tend to receive lesser punishments for
wrongdoing, and you are liked by most.

APPENDIX

Scholar of Enemies (2pt. Merit)
You have taken the time to learn about and specialize in one particular enemy of your Sect. You are aware
of at least some of the group’s customs, strategies, abilities, and long-term goals, and can put that knowledge
to good use. This Merit is worth a -2 difficulty for all
non-combat rolls pertaining specifically to the subject
of your specialization. On the other hand, you are at a
+1 difficulty when it comes to dealing with other enemies, simply because you’re so thoroughly focused on
your field.

Scholar of Others (2pt. Merit)
This Merit functions identically to Scholar of Enemies, except that it applies to a group that is not necessarily inimical to your Sect.

Friend of the Underground
(3pt. Merit)
While you’re not a Nosferatu, you know your way
around the sewers, tunnels, ducts, subway tubes, and
other subterranean passages of your hometown. The local Nosferatu (and any other creatures dwelling down
in the muck) may not actually like you, but they’re not
inclined to kill you on sight when they see you in their
territory. You are at -1 difficulty on any rolls involving
the subterranean world (sneaking from place to place
underground, finding routes into sub-basements, and
so on). Nosferatu cannot purchase this Merit.

Mole (3pt. Merit)
You have an informer buried in one of your Sect’s
enemy organizations who funnels you all sorts of information as to what her peers are up to. What you
do with the information is up to you, but abusing the
knowledge might be a good way to get your informer
killed. The other side has spies too….

Rising Star (3pt. Merit)
You’re one of the up-and-comers in the city, a rising
star in your Sect. Everyone wants to know you and be
your friend, even as those in power groom you for positions of greater responsibility. You are at -1 difficulty
on all Social rolls against any vampires in your Sect
who aren’t actively opposing your ascent.

Broken Bond (4pt. Merit)
You were once blood-bound but have secretly slipped
the leash, and you are free to act as you will once more.
Your regnant has no idea that you are not in fact bound,

and continues to treat you as if you were. At Storyteller
discretion, the experience of having been bound once
may render you immune to ever being enthralled again.
Sabbat vampires cannot take this Merit.

Clan Friendship (4pt. Merit)
One particular Clan (not your own) has a special liking for you. You might have done the Clan as a whole a
favor at some point, or perhaps you’re just a loud voice
in support of their aims. Whatever the case, you’re at
-2 difficulty on all friendly Social rolls involving members of the Clan in question. Of course, the reaction
your cozy relationship with another Clan is likely to
draw from your own Clan leaders is an entirely different can of worms.

Primogen/Bishop Friendship
(4pt. Merit)
The ruling vampires of the city value you and your
opinions. You are called in to consult on decisions, and
your recommendations carry great weight. Your position may not be an official one, but it’s powerful nonetheless.

Botched Presentation (1pt. Flaw)
When your sire presented you to the Prince of the
city, you flubbed it. Now you’re convinced His Majesty
hates you (whether he does or not). You need to succeed on a Willpower roll (difficulty 7) just to stand in
front of the Prince or one of his duly authorized representatives without running, blubbering, or otherwise
making a fool of yourself. This Flaw can only be taken
by Camarilla vampires.

Dark Secret (1pt. Flaw)
You have some sort of secret that, if uncovered,
would be of immense embarrassment to you and would
make you a pariah in the local Kindred community.
This could be anything from having murdered an elder
to being a member of the Anarchs.

Expendable (1pt. Flaw)
Someone in power doesn’t want you around. Maybe
she wants territory you possess, or is jealous of the attention you’re getting from a prize mortal retainer —
the details are irrelevant. What does matter is that she
has the power to maneuver you into dangerous situations “for the good of the Sect,” and has no compunctions about doing so.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

489

Incomplete Understanding (1pt. Flaw)

Sire’s Resentment (1pt. Flaw)

The whole matter has been explained to you, but
you’re still not quite sure how things in your Sect work.
Your imperfect understanding of the rules and regulations of your new existence means that sooner or later,
you’re going to make a mistake. It’s only a matter of
time….

Your sire dislikes you and wishes you ill. Given the
smallest opportunity, she will actively seek to do you
harm. Your sire’s allies also work against you, and many
elders may resent you.

Infamous Sire (1pt. Flaw)
Your sire was, and perhaps still is, distrusted and disliked by many of the city’s Kindred. As a result, you are
distrusted and disliked as well.

Mistaken Identity (1pt. Flaw)
You look similar to descriptions of another Kindred, which cause cases of mistaken identity. This can
prompt numerous awkward or even dangerous situations, especially if your “twin” has a terrible reputation
or is wanted for some crime.

New Arrival (1pt. Flaw)
You’ve just arrived in your new city of residence, and
don’t know anyone in the place. Existing factions may
try to recruit or eliminate you, while vampires in positions of authority size you up and take your measure.
Meanwhile, your ignorance of the city’s current events,
history, and politics (not to mention the personality
quirks of the vampires already in place) may cause you
to make a serious blunder.

New Kid (1pt. Flaw)
You’re the latest in the city to be Embraced or have
yet to prove yourself to your Sect, and everyone knows
it. That automatically puts you at the bottom of the
social totem pole. Other neonates take every opportunity to demonstrate your inferiority, or rival packs
constantly test your worthiness to the Sabbat. Even
if someone else is added to the ranks of the unliving,
you’re still regarded as something as a bit of a geek by
your peers — a distinction that can have dangerous
consequences if bullets start flying. All Social-related
rolls are at +1 difficulty when you are dealing with other neonates. (Ancillae and elders lump you in with all
the other neonates under their general disdain.)

Recruitment Target (1pt. Flaw)
Someone in one of your Sect’s enemy organizations
wants you, and they want you bad. Every effort is being
made to recruit you, willing or no, and the press gangs
usually show up at the worst possible time.

490

Special Responsibility (1pt. Flaw)
Shortly after your Embrace, you volunteered for
some task in order to gain respect and approval from
the vampires around you. Now, you wish you had never opened your damn mouth! While you are not given
any special credit for performing this duty, you would
lose a lot of respect if you were to stop. The nature
and the details of your duty should be worked out with
the Storyteller in advance. Ideas can range from lending money to other Kindred to acting as a messenger
or possibly gathering victims for ritae (such as Blood
Feasts).

Sympathizer (1pt. Flaw)
You have publicly expressed sympathy for some of
the goals and policies of the enemies of your Sect. Your
outspoken views on the subject have made you suspect
in the eyes of the city’s hierarchy, and you may be suspected of (or arrested for) treason.

Enemy (1-5pt. Flaw)
You have an enemy, or perhaps a group of enemies,
who seek to harm you. The power of the enemy depends upon how many points the player wishes to
spend (five points indicate the wrath of a Methuselah
or other potent supernatural foe).

Bound (2pt. Flaw)
You are blood bound to another vampire. Your regnant may not necessarily treat you badly, but the fact
remains that your will is not entirely your own. The
knowledge gnaws at you, even as you find yourself lost
in devotion to your vampiric master. Sabbat vampires
cannot take this Flaw.

Catspaw (2pt. Flaw)
You’ve done dirty work for someone high up in the
city’s hierarchy in the past — the Sheriff, the Bishop,
or even someone higher. However, instead of granting
you favor, your deeds have made you an embarrassment
or a liability. For the moment, your former employer’s
concern is to keep you quiet. In the long term, it’s to
get rid of you.

APPENDIX

Escaped Target (2pt. Flaw)
You had targeted a mortal for the Embrace, but
someone else got there first. You cannot stand the humiliation of being cheated of your prize, and fly into a
rage (+2 difficulty to avoid frenzy) whenever you see
the one who got away. This hatred may lead you into
other irrational behaviors, like Embracing enemies of
the neonate, creating unauthorized childer, or even
trying to kill your rival. Furthermore, your petty and
irrational behavior is well-known and quite noticeable,
and as a result you are at + 1 difficulty on all Charisma
rolls until the situation is resolved.

Failure (2pt. Flaw)
You once held a title in the city, but failed catastrophically in your duties. Now you are branded incompetent, excluded from circles of power and responsibility,
and generally ostracized by those on their way up. Your
exclusion may make you a target for recruitment by
the Sect’s enemies (or so the whispers run, making you
even more distrusted). Conversely, the consequences
of your error might come back to haunt you.

Masquerade Breaker (2pt. Flaw)
In your first nights as a vampire, you accidentally
broke the Masquerade — and were spotted doing so.
Someone else covered for your mistake, but holds the
favor over you. Now you exist in fear that your error
will be revealed. In the meantime, your “savior” takes
pitiless advantage of you. This Flaw can only be taken
by vampires in Sects or Clans that respect the Masquerade.

Hunted (4pt. Flaw)
You are pursued by a fanatical witch-hunter who
believes (perhaps correctly) that you are a danger to
humanity. All those with whom you associate, be they
mortal or Kindred, may be hunted as well.

Old Flame (2pt. Flaw)
Someone you once cared deeply for is now with the
enemy. He still attempts to play on your sympathies
“for old times’ sake” while working against you. Unless
you succeed on a contested Manipulation + Expression
roll against your former friend, you cannot act against
him unless the situation becomes life-threatening.

Rival Sires (2pt. Flaw)
The flip side of Escaped Target, two vampires wanted to gift you with the Embrace. One succeeded, one
failed — and she’s not happy about that failure. You,

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

491

your actual sire, or both of you have become the target
of the failed suitor’s ire. Regardless, your persecutor is
at +2 difficulty to refrain from frenzy in your presence.
In addition, she may well be working actively to discredit or destroy you.

Uppity (2pt. Flaw)
You are proud of your new status in the Sect — so
proud that you’ve shot your mouth off to other Kindred
and made some enemies. Wiser vampires laugh at you
and chalk your rudeness up to youth, but others find
you arrogant and insulting. These enemies will take action to embarrass or harm you. Furthermore, you are
at +2 difficulty on all Social rolls against any vampires
you have alienated through your yammering — and
you may not know who they are.

Narc (3pt. Flaw)
You are known to be a snitch, an informer firmly
planted in the pocket of the vampires in charge. Those
on whom you might yet inform loathe you as a result,
feeding you misinformation when they can in an attempt
to discredit you. Given the opportunity, they might do
you mischief. Regardless, your reputation as a weasel precedes you, putting you at +1 difficulty on all Social rolls
against those who don’t agree with your politics.

Sleeping With the Enemy (3pt. Flaw)

At Storyteller discretion, you may also be required
to make a Willpower roll (difficulty 6) to keep your
mouth shut any time the opportunity presents itself for
you to brag about your pack, your Clan, or your status.

You have some sort of intimate connection with a
member of an opposing Sect or inimical Clan. You may
have a lover, a childe, a friend, or a contact working
the other side of the fence, but regardless of politics
you retain a friendly (or more than friendly) relationship with your putative foe. Your close ties to someone
on the other side would be regarded as treason by your
superiors within the Sect, and if you are discovered,
the penalty will surely be death.

Disgrace to the Blood (3pt. Flaw)

Clan Enmity (4pt. Flaw)

Your sire regards the fact that he Embraced you to
be a titanic mistake, and has let everyone know it. You
are mocked at gatherings, taunted by your peers, and
actively despised by the one who should be giving you
guidance. Any request or petition you make is likely to
be looked down upon by friends of your sire, and your
achievements are likely to be discounted.

One Clan in particular wants you dead. You have offended the entire Clan, from elders to neonates, and as a
result every member of that bloodline wants your head on
a plate. The effects of the Flaw may manifest as anything
from very public snubs and insults to actual attempts on
your unlife. You are also at +2 difficulty on all Social
rolls relating to members of the Clan in question.

Former Prince (3pt. Flaw)

Loathsome Regnant (4pt. Flaw)

Once, you held near-absolute power in a city, but
those nights are gone now. Perhaps you stepped down,
perhaps you were deposed, or perhaps your city fell
to the Sabbat; it matters little in your reduced state.
What does matter is that the Prince in the city where
you now dwell is aware of your prior employment, and
has concerns that you might be trying to make a comeback. The machinery of the Camarilla in the city where
you now make your home is subtly stacked against you,
and if the Prince sees an opportunity to get rid of you
he just might take it. This Flaw can only be taken by
Camarilla vampires.

Hunted Like a Dog (3pt. Flaw)
Another Sect or group of vampires has decided that
you’re a target for extermination, and pursues you relentlessly. On the bright side, the enemies of your enemy may well wish to help you out, potentially garnering you allies.

492

Not only are you blood bound, but you are also in
thrall to a vampire who mistreats you hideously. Perhaps you are publicly abused or humiliated; perhaps
your master forces you to commit unspeakable acts for
him. In any case, existence under the bond is a neverending nightmare, with your regnant serving to conduct the symphony of malice. Sabbat vampires cannot
take this Flaw.

Overextended (4pt. Flaw)
You’ve got your fingers in too many pies, and people
are starting to notice. You have too many ghouls, too
many retainers, or too much influence, which means
that a lot of people have a vested interest in trimming
back your operations. These enemies take every opportunity to reduce your power and influence, and if that
means lying, cheating, or killing, so be it. Furthermore,
your enemies block every attempt you make to move
into new areas of control. You’re boxed in, and the box
is getting smaller.

APPENDIX

Probationary Sect Member (4pt. Flaw) Medium (2pt. Merit)
You are a defector. You turned traitor to the Camarilla, Sabbat, or other Sect, and you still have much to
prove before you are accepted by the Kindred you have
defected to. Other vampires treat you with distrust and
even hostility, and your reputation might even sully
those whom you regularly associate with.

Blood Hunted (4 or 6pt. Flaw)
You have been made the target of a blood hunt, and
for you to return to your home city is death. For four
points, this Flaw means that only your home city is offlimits to you. For six, it means that the entire Camarilla is howling for your vitae. This Flaw can only be
taken by Camarilla vampires.

Laughingstock (5pt. Flaw)
Somehow you’ve drawn the scorn of the local Harpies, who make you their favorite target. You are at
a +2 difficulty on all Social rolls in Elysium and a +1
anywhere else in the city. In addition, you are at +2
difficulty to use Intimidation or any Dominate powers on anyone who has heard the stories mocking you.
This Flaw can only be taken by Camarilla vampires.

Red List (7pt. Flaw)
You are either being considered for or are already on
the dreaded Red List, the registry of those vampires the
Camarilla most wants extinguished. Any Camarilla
vampire will either attack you on sight or, more likely,
call in for a great deal of help.

You possess the natural affinity to sense and hear spirits, ghosts, and shades. Though you cannot see them,
you can sense them, speak to them and, through pleading or cajoling, draw them to your presence. You may
call upon them for aid or advice, but there will always
be a price. Also, your difficulty is reduced by two for all
Awareness rolls involving the spirits of the dead.

Magic Resistance (2pt. Merit)
You have an inherent resistance to the rituals of the
Tremere and the spells of the mages of other Clans.
The difficulty of all such magic, both malicious and beneficent, is two higher when directed at you. You may
never learn magical Disciplines such as Thaumaturgy
and Necromancy.

Hidden Diablerie (3pt. Merit)
The tell-tale black streaks of diablerie do not manifest in your aura.

Lucky (3pt. Merit)
You were born lucky — or else the Devil looks after
his own. Either way, you may repeat any three failed
rolls per story, including botches, but you may try only
once per failed roll.

Oracular Ability (3pt. Merit)

Your aura is unnaturally bright and colorful for a
vampire. You register as a mortal on all attempts to
read your aura.

You can see and interpret signs and omens. You are
able to draw advice from these omens, for they provide hints of the future and warnings of the present.
When the Storyteller feels that you are in position to
see an omen, you will be required to make a Perception
+ Awareness roll, with the difficulty relative to how
well the omen is concealed. If successful, you may then
roll Intelligence + Occult to interpret what you have
seen; the difficulty is again relative to the complexity
of the omen.

Healing Touch (1pt. Merit)

Spirit Mentor (3pt. Merit)

Supernatural
Deceptive Aura (1pt. Merit)

Normally vampires can only seal the wounds they
inflict from feeding by licking them. With but a touch,
you can achieve the same effect, closing the puncture
wounds left by drinking blood.

You have a ghostly companion and guide. The identity and exact powers of this spirit are up to the Storyteller, but it can be called upon in difficult situations
for help and guidance.

Inoffensive to Animals (1pt. Merit)

True Love (4pt. Merit)

With rare exceptions, animals usually despise the
Kindred. Some flee, others attack, but all dislike being
in the presence of a vampire. You have no such problem. Animals may not enjoy being in your company,
but they don’t actively flee from you.

You have discovered, perhaps too late, a true love.
He or she is mortal, but is the center of your existence,
and inspires you to keep going in a world of darkness
and despair. Whenever you suffer, the thought of your
true love gives you the strength to persevere. This Mer-

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

493

it grants you one automatic success on all Willpower
rolls, which can be negated only by a botch die. This
can be a great gift but also a hindrance, for your true
love may require protection and occasionally rescue.

Additional Discipline (5pt. Merit)
You can take one additional Discipline (Storyteller
discretion) as if it were a Clan Discipline. All costs
to learn that Discipline are paid out as if it were native to your Clan. A character cannot take this Merit
more than once, and Caitiff vampires cannot take this
Merit.

Unbondable (5pt. Merit)
You are immune to being blood bound. Tremere cannot take this Merit.

Nine Lives (6pt. Merit)
Fate has granted you the opportunity to come as
close to Final Death as anyone can get and still survive.
When a roll occurs that would result in your death, the
roll is made again. If the next roll succeeds, then you
live — and one of your nine lives is used up. If that
subsequent roll fails, then another reroll is made, until
either a successful roll occurs or your nine lives are used
up. The Storyteller should keep careful count of how
many lives the character has remaining.

True Faith (7pt. Merit)
You have a deep-seated faith in and love for God, or
whatever name you choose to call the Almighty. You
begin the game with one point of True Faith (see the
sidebar on p. 372); this Trait adds one die per point to
all Willpower and Virtue rolls. You must have a Humanity of 9 or higher to choose this Merit, and if you
lose even a single point, all your Faith points are lost
and may be regained only when the lost Humanity is
recovered. Individuals with True Faith are capable of
performing magical acts akin to miracles, but the exact
nature of those acts are up to the Storyteller.

Cast No Reflection (1pt. Flaw)
You actually cast no reflection, just like the vampires
of legend. This can have a detrimental effect when trying to pass as a human. Vampires of Clan Lasombra automatically have this Flaw (and you may be mistaken
for one of them if you possess this).

494

Cold Breeze (1pt. Flaw)
A chill wind follows you everywhere you go. While
it may make for dramatic entrances, this effect also discomfits mortals (+1 difficulty on all appropriate Social
rolls) and marks you as obviously supernatural. Cold
winds sweeping through executive offices or crowded
nightclubs can raise all sorts of questions.

Repulsed by Garlic (1pt. Flaw)
You cannot abide garlic, and the smallest whiff of its
scent will drive you from a room unless you make a successful Willpower roll (difficulty based on the strength
of the odor).

Touch of Frost (1pt. Flaw)
Plants wither as you approach and die at your touch.
Your touch leeches heat from living beings, as though
you were made of ice.

Cursed (1-5pt. Flaw)
You are the recipient of a supernatural curse. The
strength and pervasiveness of the curse depend upon
how many points you wish to incur. Examples follow:
• If you pass on a secret you were entrusted with,
your betrayal will come back to harm you in some way.
(1 pt.)
• You stutter uncontrollably when you try to describe
what you have seen or heard. (2 pts.)
• Tools break or malfunction when you try to use
them. (3 pts.)
• You are doomed to make enemies of those whom
you most love or admire. (4 pts.)
• Every one of your accomplishments or triumphs
will eventually become soiled or fail in some way. (5
pts.)

Beacon of the Unholy (2pt. Flaw)
You radiate palpable evil. Clergy and devout mortals know instinctively that there is something horribly
wrong with you, and react accordingly.

Deathsight (2pt. Flaw)
Everything appears rotted and decayed to you. The
world appears to you as a corpse; mortals look diseased
or skeletal, buildings seem decrepit, and your fellow
Kindred seem to be walking, moldering cadavers. You
are at -2 difficulty to resist all rolls based on Appear-

APPENDIX

ance, but by the same token you are at +2 difficulty
on all Perception-based rolls. In addition, you find social interaction difficult and are at +1 difficulty on all
Social-based rolls.

Eerie Presence (2pt. Flaw)
Mortals have an unconscious awareness of your undead nature, which makes then anxious and ill at ease
in your presence. Because of this, difficulties of all rolls
relating to social interaction with mortals are increased
by two.

Lord of the Flies (2pt. Flaw)
Buzzing harbingers of decay swirl around you everywhere. Their constant presence makes it difficult for
you to interact socially (+1 difficulty when appropriate) and nearly impossible to sneak up on someone
or hide effectively. The buzzing of the flies inevitably
gives you away — all Stealth rolls are at +2 difficulty.

Can’t Cross Running Water
(3pt. Flaw)
You believe in the old folklore, and cannot cross running water unless you are at least 50 feet (15 meters)
above it. Running water is considered to be any body of
water at least two feet (half a meter) wide in any direction and not completely stagnant.

Haunted (3pt. Flaw)
You are haunted by an angry and tormented spirit,
most likely one of your first victims. This spirit actively
attempts to hinder you, especially when feeding, and
does its utmost to vent its anguish upon you and anyone in your presence. The Storyteller determines the
exact nature of the spirit, its powers, and whether or
not it can eventually be laid to rest.

Repelled by Crosses (3pt. Flaw)
You are repelled by the sight of ordinary crosses,
believing them to be symbols of holy might. When
confronted by a cross, you must make a Willpower roll

(difficulty 9) or flee from the symbol for the duration
of the scene. If you botch the roll, not only must you
attempt to flee, but the touch of the cross can cause aggravated damage (one health level of damage per turn
that the cross touches your skin). This damage cannot
be soaked, even if the vampire possesses Fortitude.

Grip of the Damned (4pt. Flaw)
There is no ecstasy in your Embrace — only terror
and pain. Mortals upon whom you feed struggle and
shriek while you attempt to feed, requiring you to
grapple with them for as long as you wish to take their
blood. For vampires with high Humanity, this experience may require a Humanity roll, at the discretion of
the Storyteller. Giovanni cannot take this Flaw.

Dark Fate (5pt. Flaw)
You are doomed to experience Final Death or, worse,
suffer eternal agony. No matter what you do, you cannot avoid this terrible fate. At some point during the
chronicle, your Dark Fate will come upon you. Even
more ghastly is the fact that you occasionally have visions of this fate, and the malaise these images inspire
requires an expenditure of a temporary Willpower
point to avoid, or else you lose a die from all of your actions for the remainder of the night. It is up to the Storyteller to determine the exact nature of this fate, and
when it will occur. This is a difficult Flaw to roleplay;
ironically, though it may seem as though it removes
all free will, the knowledge of one’s death can be quite
liberating.

Light-Sensitive (5pt. Flaw)
You are even more sensitive to sunlight than other
vampires are. Sunlight causes double normal damage,
and the light of the moon can cause lethal damage in a
manner similar to the sun, though it must shine directly upon you. Even bright lights hurt your eyes, requiring the use of sunglasses. Followers of Set and related
bloodlines cannot take this Flaw, as they already have
a worse version of it.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

Ghouls
A vampire’s blood has great power — power that
can be passed on. Long ago, the Kindred discovered
that mortals who drank vampiric blood would become
possessed of supernatural abilities and dark appetites.
Soon it became common practice for vampires to keep
certain favored servants, fattening them on vitae, and
blood bonding them in the process. In doing so, they
created undying, hellishly loyal servitors — ghouls.
Most ghouls exist at the whim of their domitors (masters), serving loyally in exchange for vitae. As they are
as susceptible to the blood bond as anyone, ghouls are
almost without exception unfailingly devoted to their
masters — and if the domitor has more than one ghoul
servant, the result may be a jealous struggle between
them for the domitor’s favor. A ghoul’s emotions run to
extremes with the heady drug of vitae in his veins — such
a creature often falls prey to great rages and disturbing
cravings. The name “ghouls” was not chosen at random.

Types of Ghouls
Vassals
“No, you listen to me. I don’t care who you are or who
you’re with; the lady asked not to be disturbed. And she
isn’t going to be. Capisce?”
When most vampires think of ghouls, they picture
the vassal. Many Cainites find it inconceivable to create ghouls for any other purpose; indeed, to most Kindred, any ghouls other than vassals are blasphemies.
By and large, vassals are the “normal people” among
ghouls. Most of them didn’t ask for their new power or
immortality, although few complain too much once the
blood bond takes effect. Scant few of them know even
a quarter what a neonate does about Kindred society.
Somewhere along the line, they were just singled out
by something old and powerful, something that wanted
another pair of hands. Although a vassal’s supply of vitae is pretty much assured, that’s really all she has to
look forward to. In fact, she’d better be on her very
best behavior if she wants to keep her liquid strength
coming regularly. She also has to come to terms with
the fact that she’s in love — truly, passionately, in a
way she didn’t think she’d ever feel again after her first
love left — with a person who treats her with passing
kindness at best and draconian cruelty at worst.
The sad thing is that the great majority of vassals
really have no idea what’s going on. They don’t know

496

why they feel the way they do; they don’t know what’s
in that miracle drink their new friend gives them. But
they’re loyal, if for no other reason than they don’t
want the magic to stop. They don’t want to go back to
the monochromatic, tasteless lives they knew before.
And you know what? Those are the lucky ones. Because once a ghoul’s been dragged to the other side of
that mystery, once the Masquerade’s been broken, she
exists entirely at the sufferance of her domitor.

Independents
“You know just us well as I do that you can’t do
everything yourself, or have you forgotten that you’re
exclusively nocturnal? Trust me, I’m reliable help, and my
price isn’t hard to pay at all.”
You think being a junkie is rough? Try doing it when
the dealers want to shoot you on sight. An independent‘s road is a hard one. Kindred view these masterless
ghouls as dangerous and uncontrollable, and a vampire
very much mistrusts what he doesn’t control. Usually,
the only recourse is to kidnap and kill vampires in order to gain their blood. Others serve vampires as freelance “help,” taking care of particularly nasty daylight
problems.
Independent ghouls come from all places, but they
put a bit of distance between themselves and ordinary
people. They aren’t pawns; they do what they do deliberately. Usually, they’re orphans: A domitor dies, and
his enemies are careless enough to let a servant or two
get away. Sometimes the orphan’s been a ghoul for so
long that he knows he’ll wither away to old age in a
month if he doesn’t get some vitae. Desperation gets a
lot of independents started down this road.
Of course, some independents have more complicated stories. Some may have stumbled across Cainite society accidentally, and eventually discovered the
power that vitae contains. Others may have been cultists who discovered that there was a variety of blood
that worked much better in rituals. Some few might
even have been cannibalistic killers who picked an unusually strong victim, and learned the source of that
strength. But even without the blood bond, the addiction remains, and only a handful of those who’ve tasted
vitae never try to taste it again.

Revenants
“What? What’s wrong? You look… disconcerted.
Please, don’t be. Come inside. I want you to meet the
family. I think they’ll like you.”

APPENDIX

Revenants are ghouls for whom the condition has
become hereditary, and who are capable of generating vitae within their own veins. These long-lived,
decadent ghouls are almost always found in service
to the Sabbat, but there are exceptions. All the perverse urges and dark drives that boil up in the average
ghoul are magnified in the revenant. Revenants hold
curious family revels, typically of the sort that involve
debauchery, drugs, or victims (or all three). They see
themselves as superior to humanity, and therefore exempt from society’s mores. Some worship vampires as
virtual gods, while others aspire to vampirism themselves. Humanity, on the other hand, receives nothing
but contempt from loyal revenant scions.
Revenants are a clannish, insular lot, and different
families are unlikely to trust one another very much.
In particular, the Grimaldis and Zantosas have feuded
too often to consider each other friends. Although revenants work with ghouls from rival families when necessary, they rarely like it.

Creating a Ghoul
Step One: Character Concept
Character concepts for ghouls can be just as broad
as those for Kindred. A ghoul can be anybody, and
people have been ghouled for just about any reason.
If a Toreador catches sight of a pretty face in a crowd,
ghouling said darling is far less risky than giving her
the Embrace. When the vampire grows tired of her,
no one will complain when she turns up on a milk carton. A childe is forever — a ghoul is only for as long
as it suits you. Since the standards for ghouldom are
less exacting, your basic concept could range anywhere
from a world-renowned linguist to “that quiet guy next
door.”
Your concept includes your basic identity, Nature,
and Demeanor. It also defines your role in the chronicle. Generally speaking, your character begins the game
either as a vassal under the blood bond to a domitor, as
a member of a revenant family, or as an independent
with alternate means of obtaining vitae to preserve her
powers. Whichever disposition you pick, consider the
following questions to flesh out your character.
• How did you first find out you were twice as strong
as before, and what did you do with your newfound
power? What’s your day job? Do you have trouble there
these days? Have you ever been driven into a frenzy,
and how? Do you know you’re an addict, or do you fool
even yourself? How do you rationalize your habit? Do

you hate anybody enough that you now feel like doing something about it — or have you done it already?
How would you describe the Blood? What metaphors
best sum up that incredible rush? Would you let a loved
one become a ghoul, or would you try to stop her?
• For vassals, what sort of person were you before
you became a ghoul? Do you define yourself mainly by
your relationship to your master? Why were you chosen; what do you have to offer your domitor? Were you
tricked into becoming a ghoul, or did you go willingly?
Are you treated fairly, or is your liege abusive? What’s
your master’s Clan, and what do you know about her
role among the city’s Kindred? Have you ever felt anything as powerful as the blood bond?
• If you were born a revenant, what family do you
belong to? How strong are those family ties? How did
your extremely prolonged childhood affect you? Were
you abused by your family? Do you have any sibling
rivalries? Have you run into trouble with the ghoulhating members of your Sect? Why are you away from
home? Will you ever go back, and if so, how will you
be received?
• As an independent, how did you receive your first
taste of vitae? How do you maintain your all-important
supply of the Blood? Do you interact with Kindred on
their own terms, or do you deliberately avoid becoming
entangled in their politics? Are you an escaped vassal?
If so, what was your role: paramour, soldier, aide? Do
you know about any other denizens of the World of
Darkness? Do you want to?

Step Two: Select Attributes
A ghoul has fewer dots to divide among her Attributes, as her starting capabilities are more mundane
than a vampire’s. However, you’ll get a bit more flexibility with freebie points in Step Four. You begin play
with one free dot in each Attribute. After prioritizing
Attribute categories, spend six dots among primary Attributes, four among secondary, and three among tertiary.

Step Three: Select Abilities
Select primary, secondary, and tertiary groups for
Abilities. The primary group receives 11 dots, the secondary group gets seven, and the tertiary group receives
four. Unlike Attributes, characters do not begin the
game with automatic dots in any Ability. No Ability
may be purchased above three dots during this stage of
character creation. You may raise Abilities higher with
freebie points in Step Four.

498

APPENDIX

Step Four: Select Advantages
Although weaker than Cainites, ghouls still have an
edge over ordinary men and women. All ghouls begin
play with one dot of Potence, which they learn instinctively and immediately. Each ghoul also has one dot in
another Discipline, which should be chosen according
to your character concept. The exceptions to this rule
are Protean, Thaumaturgy, and other Clan-exclusive
Disciplines. These highly specific Disciplines are available only to vassals of the appropriate Clan.
If you’re playing a vassal, you must pick a Discipline
that your domitor knows. Check with your Storyteller;
your domitor’s Clan will usually be a guide.
If you’re playing a revenant, you should choose your
second Discipline from your family’s traditional Disciplines.
Independent ghouls have no Clan restrictions, but if
you are creating an independent character, the Storyteller may require you to choose your second dot from
among the innate physical Disciplines (Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence).
Ghouls and revenants are typically limited to learning only the first level of any Discipline. Their borrowed vitae simply isn’t potent enough to bestow more
powerful abilities. However, they can exceed this limit
by consuming blood from more powerful vampires.
The potency of said blood is directly connected to the
donor’s Generation — the closer the vitae to Caine,
the more powerful the Disciplines a ghoul may learn.
The ghoul must drink this potent blood for a considerable period of time (generally, long enough to gain
the requisite experience points to buy such advanced
Disciplines).
The chart below gives a suggested correlation between a donor’s Generation and the level of Disciplines a ghoul may attain.

blood point, and have a blood pool of 2 or more, depending on age — see p. 500 for details). Ghouls receive 21 freebie points, more than starting vampire
characters. This reflects their mortal flexibility, as well
as the traits that initially made them attractive or useful to vampires.

Disciplines of her first domitor, regardless of
the domitor’s actual Disciplines. So, while a
Toreador may know Dominate, his ghoul still

Potence. A revenant gets a cost break on her

treated as an independent from that point on,
while an independent who becomes blood

may actually “wean” themselves off a blood bond by
refusing to accept blood from the domitor.

I Was Embraced Yesterday
When a ghoul character is Embraced, give
them any Attribute and Ability points necessary to raise them to the starting values for
vampires.
Backgrounds and Virtues are unchanged. Embraced ghouls also receive the same Discipline
points as a starting vampire. They retain any
Disciplines learned as a ghoul when they are
Embraced, including Potence. They are now
also able to teach those Disciplines, to the
same extent as any other vampire.

However, it is by no means easy to abstain. At the
Storyteller’s option, a ghoul may have to spend Willpower points to avoid the enticement of an ex-domitor’s vitae until she is completely free of the bond. If
the ghoul has an addiction-prone personality, such as a
Conformist or Child Nature, she may never completely
shake the craving.

Disciplines

Rules
Revenants
Revenants manufacture their own vitae, though they
may drink vampire vitae as well. Revenants may spend
their vitae normally and replenish their vitae supplies
at the rate of one blood point per day. This renewal
presupposes that the revenant in question is healthy
and properly nourished.

Blood Bond
Ghouls are still living beings, and so the mechanics
of blood bonding them differ from those used to govern
vampires. For a ghoul, a blood bond is not a sudden
plunge into love, but a gradual slide into an emotional
abyss.
After the first drink, a ghoul displays strong feelings
toward the donor. There are no mechanical effects, but
the feelings or the battle to suppress them should be
roleplayed. Most independent ghouls, especially those
dealing with charismatic or attractive Kindred, prefer
to take one drink and move on.
After the second drink, things aren’t so simple; the
ghoul is considered to be under an effect equivalent to
a Vinculum score of 5 (see p. 289).
Ghouls with Willpower scores of 5 and below may
have to make Self-Control rolls to avoid taking a third
drink, and even ghouls with high Willpower scores
may have to roll if (in the Storyteller’s opinion) the
temptation to drink is strong. Unlike vampires, ghouls

500

Kindred folklore claims that a year is required to
become fully “emancipated.” In reality, the time required depends on the ghoul. After a “dry” period of
12 months minus one month per Willpower dot, a
ghoul drops one level on the blood bond chart — for
example, a ghoul who was fully bound is considered to
be two steps toward being bound. Each such interval
of withdrawal reduces the bond by one level, until the
ghoul is “clean.”

Ghouls have much more difficulty learning Disciplines than Kindred do. The powers passed down from
Caine reach their full potency only in his childer; they
are alien to mere mortals. Generally, a ghoul may learn
only those Disciplines known by her most recent “donor.” An independent wishing to learn Obtenebration
must spend some time feasting on Lasombra vitae; similarly, a Malkavian’s vassal is unlikely to pick up Necromancy. However, once she’s learned a Discipline,
any form of vitae will allow her to use it; revenants
may even use their own vitae to fuel foreign arts such
as Serpentis. The exceptions are the physical arts of
Celerity, Fortitude, and Potence, which are instinctive
enough to be accessible to any ghoul.
Once a ghoul has learned a Discipline, the knowledge
will likely stay with her even if she doesn’t practice it
for a while (if her vitae supply is cut off, for instance).
Once her diet is restored, she may use her Disciplines
as usual. Of course, any unused talent will eventually
atrophy — after six months without drinking vitae,
a ghoul loses a dot in a Discipline. Each month after
that, she loses another dot in a Discipline until all are
gone.
Most ghouls and revenants don’t understand the
Kindred well enough to teach Disciplines to them.

Aging
A ghoul’s immunity to aging is contingent on her
supply of vitae. If she misses her monthly feeding, she
could be in real trouble. As long as she is still within

APPENDIX

her natural life span, she resumes normal aging. But if
she’s lived from 100 to 250 years, then she begins aging
at 10 times the normal rate — a year becomes a decade,
and so on. Ghouls who have lived more than 250 years
crumble instantly to dust if their supply of vitae falters.
On the other hand, elder ghouls gain some benefits —
in many ways, such prolonged exposure to vitae transforms them into something not quite human.
Elder revenants gain additional “storage capacity”
beyond their starting limit of two points. For each century of life, he gains one extra point in his blood pool
capacity. Elder ghouls who are not revenants may also
gain additional blood points, but at the rate of one per
two centuries of life (so an 800-year-old ghoul has a
Blood Pool of 6). Additionally, the difficulty to effect
regeneration decreases by one per century (see below).

Healing
Ghouls may heal using their blood pool, just as Kindred do. They can also regenerate limbs, though not
automatically. To make a regeneration attempt, a
ghoul must spend a Willpower point, spend an appropriate number of blood points (one for a finger or eye,
two for a foot or forearm, three for an entire limb) and
make a Stamina roll (difficulty 8). If the roll fails or is
botched, the ghoul may never regrow the limb. Elder
ghouls find regeneration easier: for each century of age,
the difficulty of the roll decreases by one.

Frenzy
It is the Storyteller’s duty to decide what situations
might provoke frenzy in a ghoul character. While any
individual stimulus is relatively unlikely to send a
ghoul into frenzy, ghouls experience provocation much
more commonly than vampires do. Ghouls’ human natures battle constantly with their Beasts, and most are
not given instruction in how to prevent their pseudovampiric natures from taking over. However, since the
Beast is weaker in ghouls, they typically face lower difficulties (usually, a ghoul’s frenzy difficulties are three
lower than a vampire’s).
In order for a ghoul character to resist frenzy, the
ghoul’s player must make a Self-Control roll, the difficulty of which varies. The player must score five successes before frenzy is overcome completely. With each
success rolled, frenzy is staved off for one turn.

Clan Weaknesses
A few Clans’ vitae possesses contagious properties.
Ghouls imbibing or injecting five or more blood points
over time from certain Clans must make a Stamina

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

501

roll (difficulty 5) or “inherit” a lesser form of the domitor’s weakness; this lasts until the ghoul starts taking
in blood from a different Clan, diluting the influence.
The Clans for which this rule most commonly applies
are:
• Brujah: A ghoul “pumped” on Brujah blood frenzies
at difficulties equal to those of a non-Brujah vampire.

Additionally, each week of withdrawal requires the
ghoul to make an Intelligence + Self-Control roll (difficulty 6); if this roll fails, the ghoul begins to sublimate
her cravings for vitae into a desire for human blood,
flesh, or sex. A Willpower point may be spent to resist these cravings. If the roll is botched, no Willpower
may be spent, and the victim must act on her urges.

• Follower of Set: Ghoul develops painful (-1 to dice
pools) rashes when in direct sunlight.

War Ghouls

• Malkavian: The ghoul gains a mild derangement.
• Nosferatu: Appearance drops by one or two points,
but no lower than 1.
• Ventrue: Ghoul gains a marked preference for
Ventrue blood, possibly endangering the domitor.
• Any Sabbat: No mandatory effect, but remember
the possibility of contracting disease via the Vaulderie.
At the Storyteller’s discretion, vitae from other Clans
or bloodlines may cause similar effects.

Overdosing
Ghouls can take in more vitae than their mortal bodies can comfortably handle, but this often causes dangerous side effects. For each point of Stamina a ghoul
has, she can “cram” an extra blood point into her body.
If a ghoul imbibes more vitae than she can contain, she
must make a Stamina check (difficulty 8). If she succeeds, she may use the excess blood normally.
If she fails, she suffers one point of lethal damage per
blood point above her maximum. Moreover, the excess
blood can’t be used. It takes a full scene of vomiting to
burn off such “useless” blood points; until this takes place,
the ghoul cannot use any blood points whatsoever.
While a ghoul is overdosed, her chance to frenzy becomes equal to that of a vampire’s, though certainly the
ghoul will not hunger at this point. Reaction time increases (the ghoul temporarily gains a dot in Dexterity),
but the overdosed ghoul must make a Perception + SelfControl roll each scene or suffer from violent hallucinations (effects are up to the Storyteller’s discretion).

Szlachta
These horrible creatures are the fleshcrafted minions
of the Tzimisce. Many szlachta are lobotomized as part
of the process, making them bestial creatures who understand only how to obey. Szlachta are typically twisted into nightmarish caricatures of living creatures.
The appalling alterations they undergo serve two
purposes: First, they become more frightening, often a
crucial edge in battle. Second, no szlachta may ever
enter human society again. Without the temptation of
flight, szlachta are among the most brutally loyal ghouls
an unfortunate intruder may encounter.

tates unless they are truly desperate. This is not out of
fear — Bratovitches look up to Sabbat Cainites as “big,
nasty uncles” of a sort — but rather out of disgust.
Cross a stereotypical back-country hill clan with a
Tzimisce, and season with a liberal amount of pure Neanderthal hunt-kill-mate mentality, and you’ll have a
good representation of a Bratovitch. The family primarily lairs in the North American wilderness, though
a handful of outposts can be found in South America,
and the family’s ancestral estate in Poland is still a respectably sized holding.
Disciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Vicissitude

Disciplines: Fortitude 4, Potence 6

Revenant Families
For untold centuries, the Tzimisce have practiced
the art of selective breeding on their most trusted (or
at least most useful) servants. In the early Middle Ages,
certain elders of the Clan undertook a long-term experiment studying the effects of regular vitae infusion
into the blood of several Eastern European noble families. The eventual result, a handful of generations later,
was the creation of their revenant families.
A millennium ago, over a dozen distinct revenant
lines served the Tzimisce. However, several were exterminated during the Inquisition and the Anarch Revolt, and others were absorbed into surviving families
through intermarriage. It is rumored that others have
broken away from the Tzimisce and now serve other
masters, a distinctly dangerous proposition. The revenant families that have survived to the modern nights
are universally wretched and disturbing specimens by
any “normal” standard. Incest, pedophilia, cannibalism, bestiality, substance abuse, and fringe-movement
political activism are among the more tame hobbies
practiced by the revenant families. Such behavior renders them all the more amusing to their masters, who
watch these depraved antics with a twisted glee.

Bratovitch
The Bratovitches mainly keep to their isolated rural
estates, breeding hellhounds and other unsavory beasts.
They emerge only to hunt Lupines and other creatures
of the night, to kidnap brides and studs, or to serve
as trackers for nomadic Sabbat packs. Members of this
family are, as a general rule, more subhuman than most
other revenants, and they delight in their perversity
and savagery. Most Sabbat tend to avoid Bratovitch es-

Weakness: Bratovitches are easily angered — some
would say psychotic. They make all rolls to resist frenzy
at +2 difficulty, and do not get along well with normal
mortals.

Ducheski
What little the Ducheski allow others to know about
them indicates a history of treachery. Like most of the
revenant bloodlines, the Ducheski claim to have once
served the hoary Tzimisce of the Old World. Since
those nights, however, something caused them to turn
their backs on their erstwhile masters and throw their
fates in with the Tremere. Needless to say, this has not
earned them any favor with the Fiends.
Ducheski revenants are rare, indeed, and some say
the line is dying out after severing its connections with
the Tzimisce who bred them so long ago. Rumors attribute a few crumbling manses to the family’s holdings,
mostly spread through Europe. It is here that they serve
their new masters, the Tremere. Although a few Ducheski sometimes receive the Embrace into the Clan, the
Tremere generally prefer to keep them in roles of subservience. A few prominent Warlocks maintain Ducheski
ghouls in their libraries, sanctums, and thaumaturgical
laboratories, but by and large the family remains a wellguarded secret even among the ranks of the Tremere.
The true genius of the Ducheski manifests in their
talent with machines and contraptions. They are masters of mechanical devices, sometimes devising works of
Da Vinci-like brilliance, though the purposes to which
these machines are turned are almost always grim. To
those elders who know of them, a Ducheski torture device or system of alembics is a sign of status, much like
owning a piece of original artwork. To the Ducheski, it
is the price for which they have sold their souls to escape
the talons of the Tzimisce, a burden they silently bear.
Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Thaumaturgy

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

503

Weakness: As a result of centuries spent under the
thumb of the Tremere, the Ducheski have grown quite
far from the human side of their beings. Isolation and
inbreeding has caused an aberration in the minds, bodies, and personalities of the Ducheskis, who betray the
birth defects and skittish personalities of those too far
removed from outside human contact. No Ducheski
may ever have a Social Trait above 2.

Grimaldi
Once merchants in the Italian city-states of the 12th
Century, the Grimaldis still enjoy a profitable position
of go-between for the Sabbat’s dealings with mortal society. They are probably the most “normal” of the families,
though some would argue that extreme wealth sets one
apart as much as their vampire blood does. Grimaldis are
usually groomed for positions of power, and it is not uncommon for a member of this family to hold a high political office or a corporate leadership role in his home city.
Starting at birth, Grimaldis enjoy every luxury that
life has to offer, from private schools and tutors to
decadent vacations at the most exclusive resorts to the
most wonderful toys. In addition to furthering the political agendas of their masters, the Grimaldis have a
second, more personal goal that is kept secret from all
but the leaders of the family.
Grimaldi elders believe that their continued existence
hinges on their utility to the Sabbat, and their destruction will be swift and total should the Tzimisce ever
withdraw their aegis. Accordingly, the Grimaldi have
begun to formulate contingency plans for a transfer of
family loyalty either to the Ventrue of the Camarilla
or to the Giovanni, should the Sabbat ever decide that
the Grimaldis have outlived their usefulness. Needless
to say, this information would ensure the family’s total
obliteration should it ever come to light, so the privileged few who know of these treasonous thoughts make
certain to stay well away from their nominal masters.
Disciplines: Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude
Weakness: All Grimaldis past puberty are blood
bound to Sabbat members of Bishop rank or above.
This began as a safety measure to ensure that the
Grimaldis did not betray the Sabbat in the course of
their extensive mingling with mortal society, but has
devolved to little more than a formal rite of passage
and sign of majority in modern nights. Most Sabbat
rarely call upon their thralls; those unlucky Grimaldi
whose regnants frequently impose their will upon them
are most likely be written off as “acceptable losses” if
and when the family decides to shift its allegiance.

504

Obertus
Reclusive scholars, the Obertuses have managed to
maintain their continued existence by avoiding the
Sabbat’s notice and by feeding their Tzimisce patrons a
steady trickle of research data. Originally librarians and
clerics for the Tzimisce lords of the Byzantine Empire,
the Obertus family moved first to the Clan’s ancestral
homelands in Eastern Europe, then to the New World
during the first waves of Sabbat colonization. They still
maintain a strong presence in the New England states
and the eastern Canadian provinces.
The Obertuses can best be characterized as chthonic,
both in their reclusive small-town nature and in their
constant search for knowledge that they may not necessarily want. Obertus research tends toward the paranormal: ghoulies, ghosties, long-legged beasties, and things
that go bump in the night, among other subjects.
Like the Grimaldis, the Obertuses have a secret objective that might well lead to their destruction should the
Sabbat discover it. The Obertus family elders have come
to believe that revenant existence is the key to the next
logical step in human evolution: Homo obertus is destined
to replace Homo sapiens, just as modern humans exterminated the Neanderthal. To this end, the family conducts
experiments with various permutations on the Embrace
and the ghouling process, using vitae from several captured Camarilla Kindred and one Tzimisce elder who was
foolish enough to enter voluntary torpor in an Obertuscontrolled fishing town outside Boston. No definite results have appeared yet, but the Obertuses believe they
may be close to discovering the secret of perpetuating
“ghoul” existence without a source of vampiric vitae.
Disciplines: Auspex, Obfuscate, Vicissitude
Weakness: The Obertuses were bred for intellectual
ability, sometimes at the expense of stability, and are
thus prone to monomania and similar psychological
disorders. The vast majority of Obertus revenants suffer from the Obsessive-Compulsive derangement (see
p. 292). At the Storyteller’s discretion, an Obertus may
suffer another appropriate derangement.

Oprichniki
The Oprichniki, the vassals of Russia’s Tzimisce, can
trace their origins down to the year. During the reign
of Ivan the Terrible, these mortal mercenaries served as
cutthroats to a mortal devil. Only Vlad Tepes himself
could match Ivan’s reign of blood. The Oprichniki, in
turn, carried out Ivan’s orders, performing acts of terror
against the populace, flaying anyone who complained
too loudly, and boiling the czar’s enemies.

APPENDIX

The Oprichniki barely survived the reign of Ivan the
Terrible, for they suffered his ministrations as well. He
turned them upon each other in his final years, and
only the vilest of their lot survived. The Russian Tzimisce took them in and used them as vassals over the
remaining century. Surprisingly, the Oprichniki eventually became revenants, even though they never once
served upon the Carpathians’ blighted soil. Fiends theorize the Oprichniki cursed themselves by serving Ivan
the Terrible, though this is more fable than fact.
Even before the rise and fall of the Iron Curtain, the
Oprichniki were a well-kept secret, especially from the
younger Transylvanian voivodes. The Russian Fiends
desired the Oprichniki to be their henchmen and majordomos, whether they served as vassals, intermediaries, mouthpieces, bodyguards, or cutthroats. As such,
the Tzimisce train the Oprichniki from birth to fulfill
a variety of assignments and duties. Since the collapse
of the Soviet Union, the Tzimisce are finally free of
both Brujah idealists spouting proletariat rhetoric and
the superstitious elders of the Camarilla casting dubious eyes toward the obviously exceptional skulkers in
darkness maintained by the Fiends. To this night, the
Oprichniki remain hidden from the majority of the
Clan, serving independent Russian Tzimisce.

Disciplines: Animalism, Obfuscate, Vicissitude
Weakness: The Oprichniki drawback manifests
more as a curse than a weakness. All revenants from
this family, regardless their ethnic background, suffer
at the hands of at least one ghost as per the 3-point Supernatural Flaw Haunted (see p. 495). Russian koldun
believe the ghosts are the victims of Novgorod, a Russian city that the Oprichniki decimated in their mortal years. Ivan’s assault against Novgorod resulted in
the murder and torture of thousands of innocent civilians, a crime the revenants carry with them. Even if an
Oprichniki finds a way through Disciplines or magic to
rid himself of his ghost, another always takes its place.

Zantosa
The Zantosas don’t really seem to have a reason for
continued existence. In fact, if the average Sabbat
vampire was asked her opinion of them (assuming she
had even heard of revenant families), she would likely
reply with a blank look. The Zantosa family appears
to have outlived its usefulness, and exists primarily to
continue its members’ decadent, self-indulgent lifestyles, and to provide entertainment for the Toreador
antitribu, Serpents of the Light, and Tzimisce.

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

505

Once the cream of Eastern Europe’s social elite,
the Zantosas have curdled and withdrawn, forsaking
long-term socio-political manipulation for short-term
gratification. The primary family pursuits these nights
include petty crime, vice, black marketeering, and
pushing the boundaries of sensation. Indeed, the only
apparent reason the Zantosas haven’t been wiped out
by a Black Hand-led pogrom already is that the end results wouldn’t be worth the effort expended to cleanse
their penthouses, nightclubs, and movie studios.
Recently, an internal purge rocked the Zantosa family
estate in New York. No less than two dozen family members, most with previously impeccable reputations (as
Zantosa reputations go), were put to death in sudden and
grisly fashion by household elders. Sabbat inquiries were
notably cursory (“let them kill themselves off” seems to
have been the general attitude), and were met with responses that the destroyed parties had been caught dabbling in dark sorcery — a response that, curiously enough,
did not warrant an Inquisition investigation.
The truth, known only to the Zantosa family’s uppermost echelon, is far more ominous. For the past several
centuries, the Zantosa family has guarded a torporous
form believed to be a Tzimisce vampire of great age. A
year or so ago, the crypt in which the body in question
lay was found empty with no prior warning and no evidence. No explanation has yet been forthcoming.
Disciplines: Auspex, Presence, Vicissitude
Weakness: Zantosas are rather weak-willed when it
comes to resisting temptation. Accordingly, whenever
a Zantosa is exposed to a particularly pleasurable experience, she must make a Willpower roll (difficulty
determined by the Storyteller, depending on the experience in question). Failure indicates that the Zantosa
is now obsessed with or addicted to that particular sensation (which can be anything from doing a new drug,
to performing a particular sexual position, to enjoying
a sumptuous wine, to the act of being fed upon), and
will do damn near anything to experience it again.
Zantosas are also unable to spend Willpower to resist
any supernatural power that entices them toward a new
source of pleasure, and many have met untimely ends
at the hands of Cainites, fae, and stranger creatures.

506

Others
Other revenant families have come and
gone over the centuries. Some may still exist tonight, while others have been crushed
beneath the wheels of history.
Basarab: Charismatic leaders and warriors
who served the Tzimisce during the Dark
Ages. The legendary Dracula may have risen
from this line.
Danislav: Kin of the dreaded Lupines who came
to serve the Tzimisce in ancient Transylvania.
D’Habi: Cultists who served — and betrayed
— the Baali in the name of their vampire-god
Nergal.
Enrathi: A family of slave traders and merchants with roots stretching back further than
the Roman empire. They dwell now in the
Underworld with the Tal’Mahe’Ra.
Giovanni: Rumors say that some members of
the mortal Giovanni family have become revenants through long exposure to the Blood.
Krevcheski: A long-dead line, murdered by
the Tzimisce after a great betrayal.
Khazi: Servants of the “white god” Byelobog,
betrayed by their own and exterminated during the Crusades.
Marijava: Thugee cultists who became the
spies and informers of the Nagaraja.
Rafastio: Blood magicians who preserve the
Black Hand’s association with an ancient
lodge of human wizards.
Szantovich: Transylvanian spies and infiltrators who allied with several Clans.
Servants of Anushin-Rawan: Debased fisherfolk who served an eccentric Ventrue in early
modern Greece.

APPENDIX

Sabbat Ritae
The Sabbat values its bonds of loyalty and fraternity
above all else. To this end, the Sect has established
many rituals, which reinforce pack and Sect solidarity. The entire Sect observes the same auctoritas ritae,
while the ignoblis ritae vary greatly in number, subject,
and observation from pack to pack.
Packs observe the auctoritas ritae at common times
— at esbats (Sabbat gatherings), before sieges, or when
bringing a new member into the pack, for example.
The ignoblis ritae may occur at any time, usually when
the Pack Priest believes them to be most appropriate.
Some packs observe greeting or parting ritae, feeding
ritae, ritae of diablerie, and any number of variations.
Basically, any event of import, common or otherwise,
might have an associated ignoblis ritus in a given
pack.
System: Ritae may be conducted by anyone, in theory, though their mechanical effects only occur when
presided over by a vampire with the Rituals Background. You can’t just mix a bunch of vitae in a paper
cup and have a Vaulderie.

Auctoritas Ritae
The entire Sect practices auctoritas ritae, due to
both tradition and their significance in Sabbat beliefs.
They strengthen the Sect’s bonds of loyalty and fraternity, by providing emotional power through familiarity
with the ritae and the sorcery that accompanies them.
These are some of the auctoritas ritae practiced by the
Sect (including the Vaulderie, which can be found on
p. 288).

The Blood Bath
This ritus is performed whenever Sect leaders wish
to recognize a Sabbat vampire’s claim to a title, such
as Bishop or Cardinal. The Blood Bath formalizes the
vampire’s new status in the Sect. As many Sabbat as
possible who will serve under this new leader must attend the ceremony, for failing to do so without an adequate reason is a grave slight to the leader in question.
Starting with the priest conducting the ritus, attendant
Sect leaders and other Sabbat take turns coming forward, kneeling in front of and expressing their endorsement of or allegiance to the Cainite, and contributing a quantity of blood into a large vessel. The newly
titled vampire gives praise and/or advice to each of the
vampires present, emphasizing the benefits the Sabbat

stands to gain through the sharing of her wisdom. She
then bathes in the blood donated to the pool. Following the ceremony, all vampires present drink from the
bathing vessel (the blood in which is sometimes consecrated as a Vaulderie), symbolizing that they willingly
partake of everything the new leader has to offer.
System: Most Sabbat refuse to acknowledge a leader
who has not been confirmed through a proper Blood
Bath ceremony, if they have reason to suspect such.

The Blood Feast
No formal Sabbat gathering would be complete
without a Blood Feast. It serves both as sustenance and
as a vehicle to express the Sabbat’s lust to exist as the
ultimate predator. The Blood Feast is a ritual “meal,”
in which captured vessels are suspended from the ceiling, bound to sculptures, or otherwise immobilized and
fed from at the leisure of all vampires present. The feast
itself is as much social gathering as it is a structured
ritus, and many Sabbat make grand entrances, wearing
the best of their finery.
In preparation for a Blood Feast, a specially created
pack or hunting party will have collected humans or
even a rogue vampire or two the night before the feast.
Much shouting, cheering, and baring of fangs occurs
as the hunting party makes a formal presentation of
the night’s feast to the highest-ranking Sabbat present.
The official receives each victim and thanks the giver
by kissing her forehead. He then hands the victims
over to assistants, chosen to prepare the victims for the
feast. They bind the victims’ hands and feet together
and hoist them up on chains to hang at head level, or
they tie (or nail) the victims to objects that prevent
movement.
The night after the preparation, ghouls or low-ranking Sabbat prepare the feast location by placing the
vessels. After all the guests have arrived — it is considered grievously poor form to be fashionably late — the
priest, Bishop, or Archbishop holding the service conducts the ritus, dedicating the vessels to the Sabbat.
Cainites at the gathering then bite open the victims
and feed on the fresh vitae, often licking the wounds
closed so as not to waste. There is usually one victim
for every three vampires present at the feast; the presiding priest, Bishop, or Archbishop gets first choice of
the night’s treats, and he draws first blood.
Some Cainites of the Sabbat have been formally censured by higher-ranking Sabbat and even members of
the Inquisition and Black Hand for relying too heavily
on the Blood Feast. To be sure, mass-kidnappings and

the blood-stained halls left behind can lead vampire
hunters to the trail of careless vampires.
System: Each blood point a Blood Feast victim possesses mystically transforms into two as it leaves his
body. By the third night after a Blood Feast, however,
the blood once again condenses back down to its original amount (if it hasn‘t been used and remains in a
vampire’s body).

Creation Rites
To hear vampires outside the Sect talk, all Sabbat
are created on the fly, with recruits being drained, fed,
bashed over the head with a shovel, buried, and left to
claw their way to the surface in a starving frenzy. This
is not always the case. Most Sabbat use the “shovelhead
method” only in times of war. This infamous method
consists of collecting a number of victims, Embracing
them with the tiniest quantity of blood possible, bashing them over the head with a shovel (to knock them
unconscious before they frenzy), and burying them
in a mass grave. The newly Embraced Cainites rouse
quickly, and they must dig themselves out of the grave
to sate their frenzy, often at the expense of the weaker
vampires entombed with them. This method is simple,
relatively quick, and quite effective at stripping victims
of their Humanity. In any event, vampires created this
way have not actually received their Creation Rites. In
fact, the Sabbat does not even consider them vampires
yet, and it has little reservation against throwing legions of these frenzied horrors against their foes.
The Creation Rites themselves are much more serious, marking the passage from nonentity into True
Sabbat. After the Embrace, the new vampire is eligible
for the Creation Rites only after he has demonstrated his worth to the Sect — perhaps the very night of
his Embrace, perhaps years afterward. The ritus itself
is quite simple — the priest merely touches a flaming
brand to the initiate’s head and leads him in an oath of
allegiance. The ceremony that precedes the Creation
Rites, however, varies widely, and it is wholly in the
hands of the Cainite’s sire. Some Panders and Brujah
antitribu have ceremonies not unlike gang initiations,
which involve pummeling the vampire in question until the sire decides he’s had enough. Tzimisce ceremonies are much more civil and formal affairs, often involving recitations of one’s lineage and praise of one’s
sire. Some vampires require no ceremony at all, deciding that they have all the proof that they need from a
given vampire’s performance, while still others require
Byzantine trials or bizarre acts like bestiality, kidnapping, murder, self-mutilation, or other depravity.

508

The Rites serve several purposes, both practical and
symbolic. The flames help reduce the new Sabbat’s fear
of fire, while the ceremony teaches him what is expected of a Sabbat member like himself. Immediately
following the Creation Rites comes a Vaulderie, which
binds the Cainite to the pack — his new, immortal
family.
System: Without the Creation Rites, a vampire is
not truly a vampire in the eyes of Sabbat. Such an unfortunate may not participate in Sabbat ritae or functions until he has received the Creation Rites, and is
often kicked about, abused, and ordered around at any
of the “real” vampires’ whims.

Fire Dance
To most vampires, fire is something to be feared and
avoided, yet not to the Sabbat. While they still fear it,
they are not above turning it loose on their enemies.
To be fully Sabbat, one must face the Rötschreck and
master it.
To enact this ritus, the priest lights a large bonfire
in a place secure from mortal eyes. Through the rhythmic beating of a drum, chanting, or both, participating Cainites enter a trance-like frenzy, whirling around
the flames, writhing before them and even prostrating
themselves in front of the blaze. As the ceremony
reaches its peak, the vampires rave and chant, and encourage each other to jump through the flames. They
make fantastic leaps, some even turning aerial somersaults over and over again to the point of exhaustion.
The Fire Dance comes to a close when the last vampire
present has jumped through the flames and collapsed
from all the activity.
System: For a vampire to even approach the blazes,
the player must succeed in a Courage roll (difficulty
only 5, because of the trance-frenzy). For a vampire
to successfully leap the flames, the player must make a
Dexterity + Athletics roll (difficulty 6 to simply jump
the flames, though Storytellers should feel free to increase the difficulty if the character tries to leap in a
particularly dramatic or acrobatic way).
After a Fire Dance, characters who leapt through the
flames gain a temporary bonus point of Courage for the
three nights following the ritus. This bonus point may
even exceed the normal Virtue limit of 5.

Games of Instinct
The vampires of the Sabbat engage in numerous
sanctioned “games,” adjudicated by their Pack Priests
to maintain their predatory edge. These games take

APPENDIX

various forms, and different packs practice different
styles — everything from parodies of children’s games
or sports to completely unique vampiric tests of skill
can be made into a Game of Instinct. The only commonality between the games is that the priest presides
over them, consecrating them as righteous exercises.
Here are some common examples:
• Cowboys and Indians/Cops and Robbers: The
object of Cowboys and Indians is to capture or incapacitate (but not kill) as many members of the other
side as possible. Because of vampires’ innate resistance
to damage, this is easier said than done, and bullets
aplenty fly during these games. The team that knocks
the other out of commission is the winner.
• Demolition Derby: Starting at opposite ends of a
street or parking lot, pack members set their cars on fire
and charge another team’s car. After much bashing and
crashing, one team inevitably has to flee their car or
burn to death; the first team to exit its vehicle loses.
• Dogtagging: The object of the game is to capture a
werewolf, tag its ear (with tags similar to kind used by
cattle ranchers), and turn it loose.
• Rat Race: A human is sealed in a labyrinth of
some sort, such as an abandoned factory or part of a
sewer system. The human is given weapons that can
hurt vampires, such as handguns, knives, blow-torches,
or chainsaws. The participating vampires, starting in
different locations in the maze, hunt the human, while
the human tries desperately to escape the vampires.
Whichever vampire captures and drains the human
first, wins. An alternative to the Rat Race — the Bat
Race — involves vampires only.
• Rousing the Beast: The participant has to dig up
the victim of a failed mass-Embrace. Once the crazed
creature breaks the surface and frenzies, it is up to the
game participant to immobilize her and destroy her.
System: Storytellers and players are encouraged to
develop their own Games of Instinct; basically, any
mayhem works for this ritus as long as the Pack Priest
recognizes it and bestows her blessing upon it. Once
completed, for the duration of one story, the winner(s)
of a given Game of Instinct receive one bonus die to
the dice pool of the Ability they used the most during
the game. A player may not have more than one Skill
augmented in this way for any given story.

Monomacy
It is inevitable that, among vampires as headstrong
and violent as those of the Sabbat, differences of opin-

ion occur. While the vast majority of these conflicts
are handled with all the civility and reason a Sabbat
can muster, some grievances are so deep as to warrant a
more serious solution. When two (or more) Sabbat are
unable to come to a resolution, the ritus of Monomacy
serves to settle the issue.
Monomacy is usually practiced by only ranking members of packs. Many young Sabbat are too violent and
hotheaded to recognize the gravity of ritual combat to
the death, and would resort to it every time a packmate
took blood from a vessel they decided they liked. As
such, this ritus is conducted by the Pack Priest (or a
higher ranking Sabbat, if the challenge is cross-pack),
to whom a challenge is issued simultaneously with the
challenge to the rival. The priest then decides whether
or not the grudge is worth Monomacy, and whether or
not she chooses to preside over the ritual. Should the
priest deem the cause worthy, the challenged vampire
may decline. In theory, there is nothing wrong with
declining a challenge, but unless the challenger is of
such little consequence as to be below the challengee’s
notice, declining usually involves a great loss of face
(and perhaps an unsanctioned duel afterward).
The actual practice of Monomacy varies widely —
no formal code exists as to the choice of weapons, locations, or even terms of victory. Most often, Monomacy
duels are fought to Final Death in some ridiculously
dangerous or highly inaccessible place like an iron
foundry or atop a skyscraper. Whether or not the vampires may use weapons, Disciplines, or other assets is
typically the decision of the challenged. On the priest’s
invocation, the combat begins, and the last vampire
standing is declared the winner, usually followed by
other ritae and celebration.
System: The details of Monomacy are best left to the
story — troupes should be encouraged to add all the
pomp and circumstance they wish to the ritus, though
the exact details differ from pack to pack. The challenger decides upon the time and location of the duel.
The challenged decides whether or not weapons will
be used and what they will be, as well as any other details (until first blood instead of Final Death, no Disciplines, participants must wear blindfolds, participants
must ride the wave of frenzy during the duel, etc.).
The priest administering the ritus is an adjudicating
official — the duel begins and ends on her word, and
it may be aborted at any time. It is even within the
priest’s power to declare a Monomacy null and void
after the fact, but the priest who does this to favor her

VAMPIRE THE MASQUERADE 20th ANNIVERSARY EDITION

509

own candidate is looked upon with extreme displeasure
thereafter by other Sabbat.

Sermons of Caine
Some members of the Sabbat value their knowledge
of the Book of Nod. Others don’t know or care about
the book, and they see their role in the Sabbat as one
of endless war and violence. Those members who take
the story of their origins very seriously often gather to
hear sermons on their history to remind them who and
what they are. This reminder serves to strengthen their
loyalty to the Sect and their ideology. Pack members
take turns reciting from the Book of Nod, while the others sit in a semicircle holding lit candles and meditating
on the passages. The sermons are sometimes followed
by the Vaulderie, and, among more intellectual packs,
intense deliberation. Pack members often discuss the
passages read during the ritus almost until dawn.
Vampire history, particularly as far back as Cainite
legendry is largely an oral tradition — very few copies
of the Book of Nod actually exist. Few, if any, Sabbat
packs can agree unanimously on the exact phraseology
of a given passage from the book. The Sect is divided
on this matter — some Sabbat believe that as long as
the spirit of the Book of Nod is preserved, the letter is
irrelevant, while others maintain that for all Sabbat to
have the same reference, a standard book needs to be
decided upon. This schism, of course, results in a wide
variety of individual positions on the matter, from violent support on both ends of the spectrum to a profound
ambivalence for anything outside one’s pack‘s take on
the matter.
System: While this ritus does not require a system
for a mechanical effect, some Storytellers may wish
to award experience points toward the Expert Knowledge: Noddist Lore or a specialization in Occult for
participation in this ritus. Otherwise, this convention
is simply an opportunity for Storytelling, roleplaying,
and revealing bits of the great Cainite mystery.

The War Party
The Sabbat thrives on diablerie and the destruction
of elders, and this dangerous ritus serves to facilitate
both of those urges.
War parties consist of multiple packs that vie for the
blood of a non-Sabbat elder. Packs participating in the
War Party compete against one another for the privilege of killing and diablerizing the elder, but rarely do
the packs come into deadly conflict with each other,
reserving their violence for their target.

510

In preparation for a War Party, the participating
packs gather and celebrate. They may also perform the
Fire Dance, listen to Sermons of Caine, and participate
in a Blood Feast or Vaulderie. The chief of the War
Party, usually the most accomplished or highest-ranking priest among the packs, offers the assembled packs
the challenge. She stands before the individual packs,
each lined up behind their leaders, and asks each of the
packs’ leaders in turn, “Do you come freely to war, and
do you take up this noble cause, never resting until the
blood of our enemy is spilled?” The leaders respond with
a forceful “We do!” Only after the packs have committed to the hunt does he reveal the identity of their target. A pack suffers great humiliation if it backs out of a
challenge after its members have committed themselves
to this most dangerous game. For the remainder of the
night, the vampires hold a revel, preparing themselves
for the hunt the next evening holds in store.
The War Party sets out after its prey on the night
following the challenge — the hunt has begun. Sabbat
vampires on the warpath stop at nothing to take down
their prey. They kill, burn, smash, and overturn anyone or anything that stands between them and their
target. The winning pack is the one whose member
consumes the elder’s blood first. The target, unliving or
dead, or some recognizable portion of the target, must
be brought back to the place where the packs accepted the challenge. The Chief of the War Party accepts
this trophy and bestows her blessing over the winning
pack. Once the chief recognizes the winner, all bets are
settled and another celebration is held.
System: The vampire partaking of the diablerie
gains the benefits of committing the Amaranth. Vampires who belong to the winning pack gain a temporary point of Sabbat Status. This point disappears at
the end of the next War Party (unless the same pack
wins again), or at the end of the next grandiose Sabbat
affair. At the Storyteller’s option, this Sabbat Status
point may be made permanent if the hunted elder was
of exceptional power or reputation.

The Wild Hunt
One of the greatest crimes a Sabbat can commit is to
turn traitor, and the Sect protects its secrets. If a member reveals a Sect secret to the enemy, she is punished
severely. If a Sabbat leaks information of a vital nature,
a priest may call for a Wild Hunt. The Wild Hunt is
much like the blood hunt, but ends with the eradication of the offending Sabbat Sect member, as well as
anyone — Kindred or kine — who may have knowl-

APPENDIX

edge of the betrayal. The gravity of the Wild Hunt
depends upon the traitor in question — the packs are
expected to police their own ranks, while high-profile
turncoats receive the attention of Archbishops, Prisci,
Cardinals, and all those who serve them.
The priest assembles the local Sabbat and formally
calls them to the hunt, which is sometimes similar to
the preface of a War Party. Once caught, the offending Sabbat is staked and immobilized. The pack takes
her before the Ductus and Pack Priest (or Bishop, etc.),
who recite her crimes to her packmates. The pack then
torments the offender in whatever manner it deems appropriate — hot irons, Vicissitude, and mutilation are
the least-creative forms of vengeance a righteous pack
can inflict on a traitor. Finally, the pack destroys the
traitor by throwing her (still staked) on a consecrated
burning pyre.
After the traitor meets her end, the Sabbat pursues
those who either learned of the secret or were involved.
Sabbat justice is relentless — the Sect stops at nothing
to ensure their security. Naturally, the Sabbat cannot
know about every little (or even many of the big) secrets that slip through the cracks. Frustration over this
fact often makes things doubly bad for those they do
catch.
System: Sabbat who are subject to the Wild Hunt
are no longer Sabbat, and thus, no longer considered
by the Sect to be vampires at all. No amount of groveling can convince the Sect to take back a traitor,
though this harsh reality comes more out of security
than bullheadedness.

Ignoblis Ritae
Unlike the auctoritas ritae, the “low” or “common”
rituals vary widely from pack to pack. Several of these
ritae show up in some form or another in every Sabbat
pack, but many of them are unique to regions or even
individual packs. Storytellers and players are encouraged to adapt or create their own ritae, to give a sense
of camaraderie and significance to the pack.

Acceptance Ritus
This ritus welcomes a new member to a particular
pack, to recognize the ascension of a recruit, or any
time a change in power or membership occurs (such as
a new Ductus or Pack Priest). Each member of the pack
must recognize the new position of their fellow Sabbat
in a personal manner, be it by sharing blood, the giving

of a gift, or whatever. The Sabbat being accepted must
make an oath of allegiance to each member of the pack,
and to the Sabbat cause in general. The Acceptance
Ritus differs from the Creation Rites because it is more
social than supernatural. A Sabbat may have received
his Creation Rites, but may be snubbed by a pack that
refuses to extend him the ritus of acceptance.

Contrition Ritus
Even Sabbat commit sins and indiscretions, for
which they sometimes need to atone. The Contrition
Ritus allows for this, much in the same manner a Catholic confession works. This ritus is perhaps the most
important of the ignoblis ritae, as many Inquisitors,
Black Hand operatives, Pack Priests, and Ducti offer
a choice of contrition or death to Sabbat who have
committed wrongs upon the Sect. All sensible Sabbat
take these ritae as seriously as they would any other, for
only by the grace of their betters can they continue to
exist. Of course, many disingenuous Sabbat may make
an insincere act of contrition, but they might not be
extended the option next time.

Stealth Ritus
In the interests of maintaining silence, some packs
take extra precautions and invoke favorable omens. In
the Stealth Ritus, all participating vampires bite out
each other’s tongues and spit them into a fire. Though
this causes no health levels of damage, the immediate
bleeding and healing consumes one blood point. The
Pack Priest or Ductus usually bows out so he can issue
orders, but some packs have developed complex hand
signal systems so they may communicate silently while
on stealth-intensive activities.

Sun Dance
The Sun Dance tests Cainites’ endurance and bravery.
During the ritus, vampires writhe and gyrate in a hypnotic dance around a symbolic inscription of a fiery sun
from sunset to sunrise without pause, until they collapse
in exhausted heaps, covered in blood sweat. The ritus
always takes place during a full moon, and pack members usually dress for the occasion, wearing frightening
masks or red body paint. Pack members prove their
courage by seeing who among them, after an exhausting night’s dancing, can remain in the open the longest.
A Blood Feast sometimes follows the Sun Dance (especially when it is performed at heavily attended Sect
functions), as the vampires must replenish their spent
energy constantly for the duration of the ritual.

AND INDEX

Game Terms Glossary
The following terms are used throughout the rules
and are presented here for concise reference.

• Health: This is a measure of the degree to which a
character is wounded or injured.

• Ability: These are Traits that describe what a character knows and has learned, rather than her physical
and psychological make-up. Abilities are Traits such as
Intimidation, Firearms, and Occult.

• Points: The temporary score of a Trait such as
Willpower and blood pool — the squares, not the circles.

• Action: An action is the performance of a deed,
which is a consciously willed physical, social, or mental
activity. When players announce that their characters
are doing something, they are taking an action.
• Advantage: This is a catchall category that describes the mystical Disciplines and Backgrounds of a
character.
• Attribute: These are Traits that describe what a
character inherently is. Attributes are such things as
Strength, Charisma, and Intelligence.
• Botch: 1) A naturally rolled 1, which cancels out a
success die. 2) A disastrous failure, indicated by rolling
one or more 1s and no successes on the dice rolled for
an action.
• Character: Each player creates a character, an individual he portrays over the course of the chronicle.
• Dice Pool: This describes the dice you have in
your hand after adding together your different Traits.
It is the number of dice you can roll for that action.
• Difficulty: This is a number that can range from 2
to 10 (but usually from 3 to 9) which measures the difficulty of an action a character takes. The player needs
to roll that number or higher on at least one of the dice
in his dice pool.
• Downtime: The time spent between scenes, where
no roleplaying is done and turns are not used. Actions
might be made, and the Storyteller might give some
descriptions, but generally time passes quickly. It also
refers to a technique of “off-scene” roleplaying that
Storytellers can use.
• Extended Action: An action that requires a certain number of rolled successes, accumulated over several turns, for the character to succeed.

• Rating: A number describing the permanent value
of a Trait — most often a number from 1 to 5, though
sometimes a number from 1 to 10.
• Reflexive Action: A situation in which dice might
be rolled, but that does not count as an action for the
purpose of calculating dice pools. Examples of reflexive
actions are soak rolls and Willpower rolls to resist mind
control.
• Resisted Action: An action that two different
characters take against each other. Both compare their
number of successes, and the character with the most
wins.
• Scene: A single episode of the story; a time and
place in which actions and events take place moment
by moment.
• Simple Action: An action that requires the player
to get only one success to succeed, though more successes indicate a better job or result.
• Storyteller: The person who creates and guides the
story by assuming the roles of all characters not taken
by the players and determining all events beyond the
control of the players.
• System: A specific set of complications used in a
certain situation; rules to help guide the rolling of dice
to create dramatic action.
• Trait: Any Attribute, Ability, Advantage, or other character index that can be described as a number
(in terms of dots).
• Troupe: The group of players, including the Storyteller, who play Vampire, usually on a regular basis.
• Willpower: A measure of a character’s self-confidence and internal control. Willpower works differently from most Traits — it is often spent rather than
rolled.
